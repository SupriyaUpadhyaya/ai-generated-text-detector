"The past three decades of investigation on nuclear physics and pulsar astrophysics have seen gradual recognition that elastodynamic approach to the continuum mechanics of nuclear matter provides proper account of macroscopic motions of degenerate Fermi-matter constituting interior of the nuclear material objects, the densest of all known today. This paper focuses on one theoretical issue of this development which is concerned with oscillatory behavior of a viscoelastic solid globe in the regime of quasistatic, force-free, non-compressional oscillations less investigated in the literature compared to oscillations in the regime of standing shear waves. We show that in this case the problem of computing frequency and lifetime of spheroidal and torsional modes of non-radial shear vibrations damped by viscosity can be unambiguously resolved by working from the energy balance equation and taking advantage of the Rayleigh's variational method. The efficiency of this method is demonstrated by solid globe models of nuclear physics and pulsar astrophysics dealing with oscillations of a spherical mass of a viscoelastic Fermi-solid with homogeneous and non-homogeneous profiles of the bulk density, the shear modulus, and the shear viscosity.

"Two types of active region feature prominent at transition region temperatures are identified in Hinode/EIS data of AR 10938 taken on 2007 January 20. The footpoints of 1 MK TRACE loops are shown to emit strongly in emission lines formed at log T=5.4-5.8, allowing the temperature increase along the footpoints to be clearly seen. A density diagnostic of Mg VII yields the density in the footpoints, with one loop showing a decrease from 3x10^9 cm^-3 at the base to 1.5x10^9 cm^-3 at a projected height of 20 Mm. The second feature is a compact active region transition region brightening which is particularly intense in O V emission (log T=5.4) but also has a signature at temperatures up to log T=6.3. The Mg VII diagnostic gives a density of 4x10^10 cm^-3, and emission lines of Mg VI and Mg VII show line profiles broadened by 50 km/s and wings extending beyond 200 km/s. Continuum emission in the short wavelength band is also found to be enhanced, and is suggested to be free-bound emission from recombination onto He^+. ",0,1
"We show that the jet structure of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) can be investigated with the tail emission of the prompt GRB. The tail emission which we consider is identified as a steep-decay component of the early X-ray afterglow observed by the X-ray Telescope onboard Swift. Using a Monte Carlo method, we derive, for the first time, the distribution of the decay index of the GRB tail emission for various jet models. The new definitions of the zero of time and the time interval of a fitting region are proposed. These definitions for fitting the light curve lead us an unique definition of the decay index, which is useful to investigate the structure of the GRB jet. We find that if the GRB jet has a core-envelope structure, the predicted distribution of the decay index of the tail has a wide scatter and has multiple peaks, which cannot be seen for the case of the uniform and the Gaussian jet. Therefore, the decay index distribution tells us the information on the jet structure. Especially, if we observe events whose decay index is less than about 2, both the uniform and the Gaussian jet models will be disfavored according to our simulation study. ",0,1
"We present a numerical study and analytical model of the optical near-field diffracted in the vicinity of subwavelength grooves milled in silver surfaces. The Green's tensor approach permits computation of the phase and amplitude dependence of the diffracted wave as a function of the groove geometry. It is shown that the field diffracted along the interface by the groove is equivalent to replacing the groove by an oscillating dipolar line source. An analytic expression is derived from the Green's function formalism, that reproduces well the asymptotic surface plasmon polariton (SPP) wave as well as the transient surface wave in the near-zone close to the groove. The agreement between this model and the full simulation is very good, showing that the transient 'near-zone' regime does not depend on the precise shape of the groove. Finally, it is shown that a composite diffractive evanescent wave model that includes the asymptotic SPP can describe the wavelength evolution in this transient near-zone. Such a semi-analytical model may be useful for the design and optimization of more elaborate photonic circuits whose behavior in large part will be controlled by surface waves. ",0,1
"Arguments showing that exchange-only optimized effective potential (xOEP) methods, with finite basis sets, cannot in general yield the Hartree-Fock (HF) ground state energy, but a higher one, are given. While the orbital products of a complete basis are linearly dependent, the HF ground state energy can only be obtained via a basis set xOEP scheme in the special case that all products of occupied and unoccupied orbitals emerging from the employed orbital basis set are linearly independent from each other. In this case, however, exchange potentials leading to the HF ground state energy exhibit unphysical oscillations and do not represent a Kohn-Sham (KS) exchange potential. These findings solve the seemingly paradoxical results of Staroverov, Scuseria and Davidson that certain finite basis set xOEP calculations lead to the HF ground state energy despite the fact that within a real space (or complete basis) representation the xOEP ground state energy is always higher than the HF energy. Moreover, whether or not the occupied and unoccupied orbital products are linearly independent, it is shown that basis set xOEP methods only represent exact exchange-only (EXX) KS methods, i.e., proper density-functional methods, if the orbital basis set and the auxiliary basis set representing the exchange potential are balanced to each other, i.e., if the orbital basis is comprehensive enough for a given auxiliary basis. Otherwise xOEP methods do not represent EXX KS methods and yield unphysical exchange potentials. ",0,1
"We analyze the observations of the transient X-ray pulsar 4U 0115+63 with the RXTE and INTEGRAL observatories in a wide X-ray (3-100 keV) energy band during its intense outbursts in 1999 and 2004. The energy of the fundamental harmonic of the cyclotron resonance absorption line near the maximum of the X-ray flux from the source (luminosity range 5x10^37 - 2x10^38 erg/s) is11 keV. When the pulsar luminosity falls below5x10^37 erg/s, the energy of the fundamental harmonic is displaced sharply toward the high energies, up to16 keV. Under the assumption of a dipole magnetic field configuration, this change in cyclotron harmonic energy corresponds to a decrease in the height of the emitting region by2 km, while other spectral parameters, in particular, the cutoff energy, remain essentially constant. At a luminosity7x10^37 erg/s, four almost equidistant cyclotron line harmonics are clearly seen in the spectrum. This suggests that either the region where the emission originates is compact or the emergent spectrum from different (in height) segments of the accretion column is uniform. We have found significant pulse profile variations with energy, luminosity, and time. In particular, we show that the profile variations from pulse to pulse are not reduced to a simple modulation of the accretion rate specified by external conditions. ",0,1
"If the cold dark matter consists of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), anticipated measurements of the WIMP properties at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the International Linear Collider (ILC) will provide an unprecedented experimental probe of cosmology at temperatures of order 1 GeV. It is worth emphasizing that the expected outcome of these tests may or may not be consistent with the picture of standard cosmology. For example, in kination-dominated quintessence models of dark energy, the dark matter relic abundance can be significantly enhanced compared to that obtained from freeze out in a radiation-dominated universe. Collider measurements then will simultaneously probe both dark matter and dark energy. In this article, we investigate the precision to which the LHC and ILC can determine the dark matter and dark energy parameters under those circumstances. We use an illustrative set of four benchmark points in minimal supergravity in analogy with the four LCC benchmark points. The precision achievable together at the LHC and ILC is sufficient to discover kination-dominated quintessence, under the assumption that the WIMPs are the only dark matter component. The LHC and ILC can thus play important roles as alternative probes of both dark matter and dark energy. ",0,1
"We make use of new near and mid-IR photometry of the Pleiades cluster in order to help identify proposed cluster members. We also use the new photometry with previously published photometry to define the single-star main sequence locus at the age of the Pleiades in a variety of color-magnitude planes.The new near and mid-IR photometry extend effectively two magnitudes deeper than the 2MASS All-Sky Point Source catalog, and hence allow us to select a new set of candidate very low mass and sub-stellar mass members of the Pleiades in the central square degree of the cluster. We identify 42 new candidate members fainter than Ks =14 (corresponding to 0.1 Mo). These candidate members should eventually allow a better estimate of the cluster mass function to be made down to of order 0.04 solar masses.We also use new IRAC data, in particular the images obtained at 8 um, in order to comment briefly on interstellar dust in and near the Pleiades. We confirm, as expected, that – with one exception – a sample of low mass stars recently identified as having 24 um excesses due to debris disks do not have significant excesses at IRAC wavelengths. However, evidence is also presented that several of the Pleiades high mass stars are found to be impacting with local condensations of the molecular cloud that is passing through the Pleiades at the current epoch.

"We consider the extension of the supersymmetric Pati-Salam model which solves the b-quark mass problem of supersymmetric grand unified models with exact Yukawa unification and universal boundary conditions and leads to the so-called new shifted hybrid inflationary scenario. We show that this model can also lead to a new version of smooth hybrid inflation based only on renormalizable interactions provided that a particular parameter of its superpotential is somewhat small. The potential possesses valleys of minima with classical inclination, which can be used as inflationary paths. The model is consistent with the fitting of the three-year Wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe data by the standard power-law cosmological model with cold dark matter and a cosmological constant. In particular, the spectral index turns out to be adequately small so that it is compatible with the data. Moreover, the Pati-Salam gauge group is broken to the standard model gauge group during inflation and, thus, no monopoles are formed at the end of inflation. Supergravity corrections based on a non-minimal Kaehler potential with a convenient choice of a sign keep the spectral index comfortably within the allowed range without generating maxima and minima of the potential on the inflationary path. So, unnatural restrictions on the initial conditions for inflation can be avoided. ",0,1
"We have employed a 3-d energy-conserving radiation MHD code to simulate the vertical structure and thermodynamics of a shearing box whose parameters were chosen so that the radiation and gas pressures would be comparable. The upper layers of this disk segment are magnetically-dominated, creating conditions appropriate for both photon bubble and Parker instabilities. We find little evidence for photon bubbles, even though the simulation has enough spatial resolution to see them and their predicted growth rates are high. On the other hand, there is strong evidence for Parker instabilities, and they appear to dominate the evolution of the magnetically supported surface layers. The disk photosphere is complex, with large density inhomogeneities at both the scattering and effective (thermalization) photospheres of the evolving horizontally-averaged structure. Both the dominant magnetic support and the inhomogeneities are likely to have strong effects on the spectrum and polarization of thermal photons emerging from the disk atmosphere. The inhomogeneities are also large enough to affect models of reflection spectra from the atmospheres of accretion disks. ",0,1
"In an earlier paper, the effect of the nearby known supernova remnants (SNRs) on the local cosmic-rays (CRs) was studied, considering different possible forms of the particle injection time. The present work is a continuation of the previous work, but assumes a more realistic model of CR propagation in the Galaxy. The previous work assumed an unbounded three-dimensional diffusion region, whereas the present one considers a flat cylindrical disc bounded in both the radial and vertical directions. The study has found that the effect of the vertical halo boundary H on the local SNR contribution to the observed CR anisotropy is negligible as long as H≳ 2kpc. Considering the values of the halo height H≳ 2kpc obtained by different authors, the present work suggests that the study of the effect of local sources on the CR anisotropy can be carried out without having much information on H and hence, using the much simpler three-dimentional unbounded solution. Finally, the present work discusses about the possibility of explaining the observed anisotropy below the knee by a single dominant source with properly chosen source parameters, and claims that the source may be an undetected old SNR with a characteristic age of ∼ 1.5× 10^5 yr located at a distance of ∼ 0.57 kpc from the Sun.

"We study the intersection points of a fixed planar curve Γ with the nodal set of a translationally invariant and isotropic Gaussian random field Ψ(r) and the zeros of its normal derivative across the curve. The intersection points form a discrete random process which is the object of this study. The field probability distribution function is completely specified by the correlation G(|r-r'|) = <Ψ(r) Ψ(r')>.Given an arbitrary G(|r-r'|), we compute the two point correlation function of the point process on the line, and derive other statistical measures (repulsion, rigidity) which characterize the short and long range correlations of the intersection points. We use these statistical measures to quantitatively characterize the complex patterns displayed by various kinds of nodal networks. We apply these statistics in particular to nodal patterns of random waves and of eigenfunctions of chaotic billiards. Of special interest is the observation that for monochromatic random waves, the number variance of the intersections with long straight segments grows like L ln L, as opposed to the linear growth predicted by the percolation model, which was successfully used to predict other long range nodal properties of that field.

"Within a general theoretical framework we study the effective, deformation-induced interaction between two colloidal particles trapped at a fluid interface in the regime of small deformations. In many studies, this interaction has been computed with the ansatz that the actual interface configuration for the pair is given by the linear superposition of the interface deformations around the single particles. Here we assess the validity of this approach and compute the leading term of the effective interaction for large interparticle separation beyond this so-called superposition approximation. As an application, we consider the experimentally relevant case of interface deformations owing to the electrostatic field emanating from charged colloidal particles. In mechanical isolation, i.e., if the net force acting on the total system consisting of the particles plus the interface vanishes, the superposition approximation is actually invalid. The effective capillary interaction is governed by contributions beyond this approximation and turns out to be attractive. For sufficiently small surface charges on the colloids, such that linearization is strictly valid, and at asymptotically large separations, the effective interaction does not overcome the direct electrostatic repulsion between the colloidal particles.

"It is generally believed that the magnetic free energy accumulated in the corona serves as a main energy source for solar explosions such as coronal mass ejections (CMEs). In the framework of the flux rope catastrophe model for CMEs, the energy may be abruptly released either by an ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) catastrophe, which belongs to a global magnetic topological instability of the system, or by a fast magnetic reconnection across preexisting or rapidly-developing electric current sheets. Both ways of magnetic energy release are thought to be important to CME dynamics. To disentangle their contributions, we construct a flux rope catastrophe model in the corona and solar wind and compare different cases in which we either prohibit or allow magnetic reconnection to take place across rapidly-growing current sheets during the eruption. It is demonstrated that CMEs, even fast ones, can be produced taking the ideal MHD catastrophe as the only process of magnetic energy release. Nevertheless, the eruptive speed can be significantly enhanced after magnetic reconnection sets in. In addition, a smooth transition from slow to fast eruptions is observed when increasing the strength of the background magnetic field, simply because in a stronger field there is more free magnetic energy at the catastrophic point available to be released during an eruption. This suggests that fast and slow CMEs may have an identical driving mechanism. ",0,1
"We implement a standard Monte Carlo algorithm to study the slow, equilibrium dynamics of a silica melt in a wide temperature regime, from 6100 K down to 2750 K. We find that the average dynamical behaviour of the system is in quantitative agreement with results obtained from molecular dynamics simulations, at least in the long-time regime corresponding to the alpha-relaxation. By contrast, the strong thermal vibrations related to the Boson peak present at short times in molecular dynamics are efficiently suppressed by the Monte Carlo algorithm. This allows us to reconsider silica dynamics in the context of mode-coupling theory, because several shortcomings of the theory were previously attributed to thermal vibrations. A mode-coupling theory analysis of our data is qualitatively correct, but quantitative tests of the theory fail, raising doubts about the very existence of an avoided singularity in this system. We discuss the emergence of dynamic heterogeneity and report detailed measurements of a decoupling between translational diffusion and structural relaxation, and of a growing four-point dynamic susceptibility. Dynamic heterogeneity appears to be less pronounced than in more fragile glass-forming models, but not of a qualitatively different nature. ",0,1
"We derive a perturbation expansion for general self-interacting random walks, where steps are made on the basis of the history of the path. Examples of models where this expansion applies are reinforced random walk, excited random walk, the true (weakly) self-avoiding walk, loop-erased random walk, and annealed random walk in random environment.In this paper we show that the expansion gives rise to useful formulae for the speed and variance of the random walk, when these quantities are known to exist. The results and formulae of this paper have been used elsewhere by the authors to prove monotonicity properties for the speed (in high dimensions) of excited random walk and related models, and certain models of random walk in random environment.We also derive a law of large numbers and central limit theorem (with explicit error terms) directly from this expansion, under strong assumptions on the expansion coefficients. The assumptions are shown to be satisfied by excited random walk in high dimensions with small excitation parameter, a model of reinforced random walk with underlying drift and small reinforcement parameter, and certain models of random walk in random environment under strong ellipticity conditions. This is the extended version of the paper, where we provide all proofs. ",0,1
"The nature of the coupling leading to superconductivity in layered materials such as high-Tc superconductors and graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) is still unresolved. In both systems, interactions of electrons with either phonons or other electrons or both have been proposed to explain superconductivity. In the high-Tc cuprates, the presence of a Van Hove singularity (VHS) in the density of states near the Fermi level was long ago proposed to enhance the many-body couplings and therefore may play a role in superconductivity. Such a singularity can cause an anisotropic variation in the coupling strength, which may partially explain the so-called nodal-antinodal dichotomy in the cuprates. Here we show that the topology of the graphene band structure at dopings comparable to the GICs is quite similar to that of the cuprates and that the quasiparticle dynamics in graphene have a similar dichotomy. Namely, the electron-phonon coupling is highly anisotropic, diverging near a saddle point in the graphene electronic band structure. These results support the important role of the VHS in layered materials and the possible optimization of Tc by tuning the VHS with respect to the Fermi level. ",0,1
"Cosmological shock waves result from supersonic flow motions induced by hierarchical clustering of nonlinear structures in the universe. These shocks govern the nature of cosmic plasma through thermalization of gas and acceleration of nonthermal, cosmic-ray (CR) particles. We study the statistics and energetics of shocks formed in cosmological simulations of a concordance ΛCDM universe, with a special emphasis on the effects of non-gravitational processes such as radiative cooling, photoionization/heating, and galactic superwind feedbacks. Adopting an improved model for gas thermalization and CR acceleration efficiencies based on nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration calculations, we then estimate the gas thermal energy and the CR energy dissipated at shocks through the history of the universe. Since shocks can serve as sites for generation of vorticity, we also examine the vorticity that should have been generated mostly at curved shocks in cosmological simulations. We find that the dynamics and energetics of shocks are governed primarily by the gravity of matter, so other non-gravitational processes do not affect significantly the global energy dissipation and vorticity generation at cosmological shocks. Our results reinforce scenarios in which the intracluster medium and warm-hot intergalactic medium contain energetically significant populations of nonthermal particles and turbulent flow motions.

"Time variability of the solar neutrino flux especially in the low and intermediate energy sector remains an open question and, if it exists, it is likely to be originated from the magnetic moment transition from active to light sterile neutrinos at times of intense solar activity and magnetic field. We examine the prospects for the SNO+ experiment to address this important issue and to distinguish between the two classes of solar models which are currently identified as corresponding to a high (SSM I) and a low (SSM II) heavy element abundance. We also evaluate the predictions from these two models for the Chlorine experiment event rate in the standard LMA and LMA+Spin Flavour Precession (SFP) scenarios. It is found that after three years of SNO+ data taking, the pep flux measurement will be able to discriminate between the standard LMA and LMA+SFP scenarios, independently of which is the correct solar model. If the LMA rate is measured, SFP with B_0 ∼ 280kG for the resonant Δ m^2_01 can be excluded at more than 4σ. A low rate would signal new physics, excluding all the 90",0,1
"We have conducted an extensive wide-field imaging survey for Cepheid variables in the Local Group irregular galaxy WLM. From data obtained on 101 nights, we have discovered 60 Cepheids which include 14 of the 15 Cepheid variables previously detected by Sandage and Carlson. Down to a period of 3 days, our Cepheid survey in WLM should be practically complete. Importantly, we have found for the first time a long-period Cepheid (P=54.2 days) in this galaxy, alleviating the puzzle that WLM with its many blue, massive stars does not contain Cepheids with periods longer than about 10 days. Our data define tight period-luminosity relations in V, I and the reddening-free Wesenheit magnitude W_ I which are all extremely well fit by the corresponding slopes of the LMC Cepheid PL relation, suggesting no change of the PL relation slope down to a Cepheid metal abundance of about -1.0 dex, in agreement with other recent studies. We derive a true distance modulus to WLM of 25.144 ±0.03 (r) ±0.07 (s) mag from our data, in good agreement with the earlier 24.92 ± 0.21 mag determination of Lee, Freedman and Madore (1993a) from Cepheid variables.

"We study the mixing time of a systematic scan Markov chain for sampling from the uniform distribution on proper 7-colourings of a finite rectangular sub-grid of the infinite square lattice, the grid. A systematic scan Markov chain cycles through finite-size subsets of vertices in a deterministic order and updates the colours assigned to the vertices of each subset. The systematic scan Markov chain that we present cycles through subsets consisting of 2x2 sub-grids and updates the colours assigned to the vertices using a procedure known as heat-bath. We give a computer-assisted proof that this systematic scan Markov chain mixes in O(log n) scans, where n is the size of the rectangular sub-grid. We make use of a heuristic to compute required couplings of colourings of 2x2 sub-grids. This is the first time the mixing time of a systematic scan Markov chain on the grid has been shown to mix for less than 8 colours. We also give partial results that underline the challenges of proving rapid mixing of a systematic scan Markov chain for sampling 6-colourings of the grid by considering 2x3 and 3x3 sub-grids. ",0,1
"The purpose of this paper is to find optimal estimates for the Green function of a half-space of the relativistic α-stable process with parameter m onspace. This process has an infinitesimal generator of the form mI-(m^2/αI-Δ)^α/2, where 0<α<2, m>0, and reduces to the isotropic α-stable process for m=0. Its potential theory for open bounded sets has been well developed throughout the recent years however almost nothing was known about the behaviour of the process on unbounded sets. The present paper is intended to fill this gap and we provide two-sided sharp estimates for the Green function for a half-space. As a byproduct we obtain some improvements of the estimates known for bounded sets specially for balls. The advantage of these estimates is a clarification of the relationship between the diameter of the ball and the parameter m of the process.The main result states that the Green function is comparable with the Green function for the Brownian motion if the points are away from the boundary of a half-space and their distance is greater than one. On the other hand for the remaining points the Green function is somehow related the Green function for the isotropic α-stable process. For example, for d≥3, it is comparable with the Green function for the isotropic α-stable process, provided that the points are close enough. ",0,1
"We perform a series of two-dimensional magnetorotational core-collapse simulations of Pop III stars. Changing the initial distributions of rotation and magnetic fields prior to collapse in a parametric manner, we compute 19 models. By so doing, we systematically investigate how rotation and magnetic fields affect the collapse dynamics and explore how the properties of the black-hole formations and neutrino emissions could be affected. As for the microphysics, we employ a realistic equation of state and approximate the neutrino transfer by a multiflavour leakage scheme. With these computations, we find that the jet-like explosions are obtained by the magnetodriven shock waves if the initial magnetic field is as large as 10^12 G. We point out that the black-hole masses at the formation decrease with the initial field strength, on the other hand, increase with the initial rotation rates. As for the neutrino properties, we point out that the degree of the differential rotation plays an important role to determine which species of the neutrino luminosity is more dominant than the others. Furthermore, we find that the stronger magnetic fields make the peak neutrino luminosities smaller, because the magnetic pressure acts to halt the collapse in the central regions, leading to the suppression of the releasable gravitational binding energies.

"This thesis discusses the search for supersymmetry at the future Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the ongoing construction of one of the four large LHC experiments, the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS), and focuses on the detection of signals from the annihilation of supersymmetric dark matter in the spectra of cosmic rays.Measurements of cosmic ray antiparticles, such as positrons, can impose strong constraints on the nature of new physics beyond the Standard Model. However, cosmic ray positron measurements are experimentally very challenging due to the vast proton background. A novel approach of positron identification with the space-borne AMS-01 experiment, namely through the detection of bremsstrahlung conversion in a silicon microstrip detector, is introduced. Bremsstrahlung from protons is suppressed by a factor of more than 3*10^6 with respect to positrons. The results of the positron measurement show that the bremsstrahlung approach extends the sensitivity range of AMS-01 to positron momenta up to 50 GeV/c, which is far beyond the original scope of the experiment. At momenta above 8 GeV/c there is indication for a positron overabundance with respect to model predictions for purely secondary positron production. Therefore, the AMS-01 data lend further weight to the hints of a positron overabundance seen in the data from earlier experiments.The positron fraction measurements from the most recent experiments are combined with the results of this analysis, giving the most precise positron fraction data yet available.

"The branching ratios and CP violations of the B→ Dπ decays, including both the color-allowed and the color-suppressed modes, are investigated in detail within QCD framework by considering all diagrams which lead to three effective currents of two quarks. An intrinsic mass scale as a dynamical gluon mass is introduced to treat the infrared divergence caused by the soft collinear approximation in the endpoint regions, and the Cutkosky rule is adopted to deal with a physical-region singularity of the on mass-shell quark propagators. When the dynamical gluon mass μ_g is regarded as a universal scale, it is extracted to be around μ_g = 440 MeV from one of the well-measured B→ Dπ decay modes. The resulting predictions for all branching ratios are in agreement with the current experimental measurements. As these decays have no penguin contributions, there are no direct CP asymmetries. Due to interference between the Cabibbo-suppressed and the Cabibbo-favored amplitudes, mixing-induced CP violations are predicted in the B→ D^±π^∓ decays to be consistent with the experimental data at 1-σ level. More precise measurements will be helpful to extract weak angle 2β+γ. ",0,1
"As part of an effort to enlarge the number of well-studied Magellanic-type galaxies, we obtained broadband optical imaging and neutral hydrogen radio synthesis observations of the dwarf irregular galaxy ESO 364-G 029. The optical morphology characteristically shows a bar-like main body with a one-sided spiral arm, an approximately exponential light distribution, and offset photometric and kinematic centers. The HI distribution is mildly asymmetric and, although slightly offset from the photometric center, roughly follows the optical brightness distribution, extending to over 1.2 Holmberg radii (where mu_B = 26.5 mag/arcsec^2). In particular, the highest HI column densities closely follow the bar, one-arm spiral, and a third optical extension. The rotation is solid-body in the inner parts but flattens outside of the optical extent. The total HI flux F_HI = 23.1 pm 1.2 Jy km/s, yielding a total HI mass M_HI= (6.4 pm 1.7) x 10^8 Msun (for a distance D = 10.8 pm 1.4 Mpc) and a total HI mass-to-blue-luminosity ratio M_HI/L_B = (0.96 pm 0.14) Msun / Lsun,B (distance independent). The HI data suggest a very complex small-scale HI structure, with evidence of large shells and/or holes, but deeper observations are required for a detailed study. Follow-up observations are also desirable for a proper comparison with the Large Magellanic Cloud, where despite an optical morphology very similar to ESO 364-G 029 the HI bears little resemblance to the optical.

"The possibility to recover the which-way information, for example in the two slit experiment, is based on a natural but implicit assumption about the position of a particle before a position measurement is performed on it. This assumption cannot be deduced from the standard postulates of quantum mechanics. In the present paper this assumption is made explicit and formally postulated as a new rule, the quantum typicality rule. This rule correlates the positions of the particles at two different times, thus defining their trajectories. Unexpectedly, this rule is also equivalent to the Born rule with regard to the explanation of the results of statistical experiments. For this reason it can be considered a generalization of the Born rule. The existence of the quantum typicality rule strongly suggests the possibility of a new trajectory-based formulation of quantum mechanics. According to this new formulation, a closed quantum system is represented as a quantum process, which corresponds to a canonical stochastic process in which the probability measure is replaced by the wave function and the usual frequentist interpretation of probability is replaced by the quantum typicality rule.

"An end-grafted flexible polymer chain in 3d space between two pistons undergoes an abrupt transition from a confined coil to a flower-like conformation when the number of monomers in the chain, N, reaches a critical value. In 2d geometry, excluded volume interactions between monomers of a chain confined inside a strip of finite length 2L transform the coil conformation into a linear string of blobs. However, the blob picture raises questions on the nature of this escape transition. To check the theoretical predictions based on the blob picture we study 2d single polymer chains with excluded volume interactions and with one end grafted in the middle of a strip of length2L and width H by simulating self-avoiding walks on a square lattice with the pruned-enriched-Rosenbluth method (PERM). We estimate the free energy, the end-to-end distance, the number of imprisoned monomers, the order parameter, and its distribution. It is shown that in the thermodynamic limit of large N and L but finite L/N, there is a small but finite jump in several average characteristics, including the order parameter. We also present a theoretical description based on the Landau free energy approach, which is in good agreement with the simulation results. Both simulation results and the analytical theory indicate that the 2d escape transition is a weak first-order phase transition. ",0,1
"Observational cosmology provides us with a large number of high precision data which are used to derive models trying to reproduce “on the mean” our observable patch of the Universe. Most of these attempts are achieved in the framework of a Friedmann-Lemaître cosmology where large scale homogeneity is assumed. However, we know, from the observation of structures at increasing scales, that these models are only approximations of a smoothed or averaged inhomogeneous underlying patern. Anyhow, when modelling the Universe, the usual method is to use continuous functions representing the kinematical scalars of the velocity field, implicitly assuming that they represent volume averages of the corresponding fine-scale inhomogeneous quantities, then put them into the Einstein equations which are solved to give the model and its dependance upon a number of parameters arbitrarily defined. In General Relativity, such a method is very much involved since the equations which determine the metric tensor and the quantities calculated from it are highly nonlinear. The question raised by the method consisting of determining the parameters of an a priori assumed FLRW model from observational data is the “fitting problem” brought to general attention by Ellis and Stoeger in the 80's. This problem has recently experienced a reniewed attention due to the amount of available data and the increase of the minimum scale at which homogeneity can be assumed. We propose a discussion of this issue in the light of the latest developments of observational and theoretical cosmology. ",0,1
"Scaling predictions and results from self-consistent field calculations for bottle-brush polymers with a rigid backbone and flexible side chains under good solvent conditions are summarized and their validity and applicability is assessed by a comparison with Monte Carlo simulations of a simple lattice model. It is shown that under typical conditions, as they are also present in experiments, only a rather weak stretching of the side chains is realized, and then the scaling predictions based on the extension of the Daoud-Cotton blob picture are not applicable.Also two-component bottle brush polymers are considered, where two types (A,B) of side chains are grafted, assuming that monomers of different kind repel each other. In this case, variable solvent quality is allowed for, such that for poor solvent conditions rather dense cylinder-like structures result. Theories predict “Janus Cylinder”-type phase separation along the backbone in this case. The Monte Carlo simulations, using the pruned-enriched Rosenbluth method (PERM) then are restricted to rather short side chain length. Nevertheless, evidence is obtained that the phase separation between an A-rich part of the cylindrical molecule and a B-rich part can only occur locally. The correlation length of this microphase separation can be controlled by the solvent quality. This lack of a phase transition is interpreted by an analogy with models for ferromagnets in one space dimension. ",0,1
"New high-resolution observations reveal that small-scale magnetic flux concentrations have a delicate substructure on a spatial scale of 0.1”. Its basic structure can be interpreted in terms of a magnetic flux sheet or tube that vertically extends through the ambient weak-field or field-free atmosphere with which it is in mechanical equilibrium. A more refined interpretation comes from new three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations that are capable of reproducing the corrugated shape of magnetic flux concentrations and their signature in the visible continuum. Furthermore it is shown that the characteristic asymmetric shape of the contrast profile of facular granules is an effect of radiative transfer across the rarefied atmosphere of the magnetic flux concentration. I also discuss three-dimensional radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the integral layers from the top of the convection zone to the mid-chromosphere. They show a highly dynamic chromospheric magnetic field, marked by rapidly moving filaments of stronger than average magnetic field that form in the compression zone downstream and along propagating shock fronts. The simulations confirm the picture of flux concentrations that strongly expand through the photosphere into a more homogeneous, space filling chromospheric field. Future directions in the simulation of small-scale magnetic fields are indicated by a few examples of very recent work. ",0,1
"Complex networks with expanding dimensions are studied, where the networks may be directed and weighted, and network nodes are varying in discrete time in the sense that some new nodes may be added and some old nodes may be removed from time to time. A model of such networks in computer data transmission is discussed. Each node on the network has fixed dimensionality, while the dimension of the whole network is defined by the total number of nodes. Based on the spectacular properties of data transmission on computer networks, some new concepts of stable and unstable networks differing from the classical Lyapunov stability are defined. In particular, a special unstable network model, called devil network, is introduced and discussed. It is further found that a variety of structures and connection weights affects the network stability substantially. Several criteria on stability, instability, and devil network are established for a rather general class of networks, where some conditions are actually necessary and sufficient. Mathematically, this paper makes a first attempt to rigorously formulate a fundamental issue of modeling discrete linear time-varying systems with expanding dimensions and study their basic stability property.

"The dynamics of information dissemination in social networks is of paramount importance in processes such as rumors or fads propagation, spread of product innovations or 'word-of-mouth' communications. Due to the difficulty in tracking a specific information when it is transmitted by people, most understanding of information spreading in social networks comes from models or indirect measurements. Here we present an integrated experimental and theoretical framework to understand and quantitatively predict how and when information spreads over social networks. Using data collected in Viral Marketing campaigns that reached over 31,000 individuals in eleven European markets, we show the large degree of variability of the participants' actions, despite them being confronted with the common task of receiving and forwarding the same piece of information. This have a profound effect on information diffusion: Firstly, most of the transmission takes place due to super-spreading events which would be considered extraordinary in population-average models. Secondly, due to the different way individuals schedule information transmission we observe a slowing down of the spreading of information in social networks that happens in logarithmic time. Quantitative description of the experiments is possible through an stochastic branching process which corroborates the importance of heterogeneity. Since high variability of both the intensity and frequency of human responses are found in many other activities, our findings are pertinent to many other human driven diffusion processes like rumors, fads, innovations or news which has important consequences for organizations management, communications, marketing or electronic social communities.

"21-cm emission from neutral hydrogen during and before the epoch of cosmic reionisation is gravitationally lensed by material at all lower redshifts. Low-frequency radio observations of this emission can be used to reconstruct the projected mass distribution of foreground material, both light and dark. We compare the potential imaging capabilities of such 21-cm lensing with those of future galaxy lensing surveys. We use the Millennium Simulation to simulate large-area maps of the lensing convergence with the noise, resolution and redshift-weighting achievable with a variety of idealised observation programmes. We find that the signal-to-noise of 21-cm lens maps can far exceed that of any map made using galaxy lensing. If the irreducible noise limit can be reached with a sufficiently large radio telescope, the projected convergence map provides a high-fidelity image of the true matter distribution, allowing the dark matter halos of individual galaxies to be viewed directly, and giving a wealth of statistical and morphological information about the relative distributions of mass and light. For instrumental designs like that planned for the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), high-fidelity mass imaging may be possible near the resolution limit of the core array of the telescope. ",0,1
"The magnetic field in an accretion disk is estimated assuming that all of the angular momentum within prescribed accretion disk radii is removed by a jet. The magnetic field estimated at the base of the jet is extrapolated to the blazar emission region using a model for a relativistic axisymmetric jet combined with some simplifying assumptions based on the relativistic nature of the flow. The extrapolated magnetic field is compared with estimates based upon the synchrotron and inverse Compton emission from three blazars, MKN 501, MKN 421 and PKS 2155-304. The magnetic fields evaluated from pure synchrotron self- Compton models are inconsistent with the magnetic fields extrapolated in this way. However, in two cases inverse Compton models in which a substantial part of the soft photon field is generated locally agree well, mainly because these models imply magnetic field strengths which are closer to being consistent with Poynting flux dominated jets. This comparison is based on estimating the mass accretion rate from the jet energy flux. Further comparisons along these lines will be facilitated by independent estimates of the mass accretion rate in blazars and by more detailed models for jet propagation near the black hole. ",0,1
"This paper focuses on the issue of energy efficiency in wireless data networks through a game theoretic approach. The case considered is that in which each user is allowed to vary its transmit power, spreading code, and uplink receiver in order to maximize its own utility, which is here defined as the ratio of data throughput to transmit power. In particular, the case in which linear multiuser detectors are employed at the receiver is treated first, and, then, the more challenging case in which non-linear decision feedback multiuser receivers are adopted is addressed. It is shown that, for both receivers, the problem at hand of utility maximization can be regarded as a non-cooperative game, and it is proved that a unique Nash equilibrium point exists. Simulation results show that significant performance gains can be obtained through both non-linear processing and spreading code optimization; in particular, for systems with a number of users not larger than the processing gain, remarkable gains come from spreading code optimization, while, for overloaded systems, the largest gainscome from the use of non-linear processing. In every case, however, the non-cooperative games proposed here are shown to outperform competing alternatives. ",0,1

The spectrum is characterized by a blue continuum on which are superimposed broad emission lines of HI and HeII and a host of narrower absorption lines of neutral metals and molecules. Spectral type standard star spectra scaled to the dereddened spectrum of A0620-00 in K exceed the A0620-00 spectrum in J and H for all stars of spectral type K7V or earlier, demonstrating that the donor star, unless later than K7V, cannot be the sole NIR flux source in A0620-00.

"We have been monitoring Supernova (SN) 1987A with Chandra X-Ray Observatory since 1999. We present a review of previous results from our Chandra observations, and some preliminary results from new Chandra data obtained in 2006 and 2007. High resolution imaging and spectroscopic studies of SN 1987A with Chandra reveal that X-ray emission of SN 1987A originates from the hot gas heated by interaction of the blast wave with the ring-like dense circumstellar medium (CSM) that was produced by the massive progenitor's equatorial stellar winds before the SN explosion. The blast wave is now sweeping through dense CSM all around the inner ring, and thus SN 1987A is rapidly brightening in soft X-rays. At the age of 20 yr (as of 2007 January), X-ray luminosity of SN 1987A is L_ X ∼ 2.4 × 10^36 ergs s^-1 in the 0.5-10 keV band. X-ray emission is described by two-component plane shock model with electron temperatures of kT ∼ 0.3 and 2 keV. As the shock front interacts with dense CSM all around the inner ring, the X-ray remnant is now expanding at a much slower rate of v ∼ 1400 km s^-1 than it was until 2004 (v ∼ 6000 km s^-1). ",0,1
"We describe the results of an extremely deep, 0.28 deg^2 survey for z = 3.1 Ly-alpha emission-line galaxies in the Extended Chandra Deep Field South. By using a narrow-band 5000 Anstrom filter and complementary broadband photometry from the MUSYC survey, we identify a statistically complete sample of 162 galaxies with monochromatic fluxes brighter than 1.5 x 10^-17 ergs cm^-2 s^-1 and observers frame equivalent widths greater than 80 Angstroms. We show that the equivalent width distribution of these objects follows an exponential with a rest-frame scale length of w_0 = 76 +/- 10 Angstroms. In addition, we show that in the emission line, the luminosity function of Ly-alpha galaxies has a faint-end power-law slope of alpha = -1.49 +/- 0.4, a bright-end cutoff of log L^* = 42.64 +/- 0.2, and a space density above our detection thresholds of 1.46 +/- 0.12 x 10^-3 h70^3 galaxies Mpc^-3. Finally, by comparing the emission-line and continuum properties of the LAEs, we show that the star-formation rates derived from Ly-alpha are3 times lower than those inferred from the rest-frame UV continuum. We use this offset to deduce the existence of a small amount of internal extinction within the host galaxies. This extinction, coupled with the lack of extremely-high equivalent width emitters, argues that these galaxies are not primordial Pop III objects, though they are young and relatively chemically unevolved.

"We present a numerical method for spatially 1.5-dimensional and time-dependent studies of accretion disks around black holes, that is originated from a combination of the standard pseudo-spectral method and the adaptive domain decomposition method existing in the literature, but with a number of improvements in both the numerical and physical senses. In particular, we introduce a new treatment for the connection at the interfaces of decomposed subdomains, construct an adaptive function for the mapping between the Chebyshev-Gauss-Lobatto collocation points and the physical collocation points in each subdomain, and modify the over-simplified 1-dimensional basic equations of accretion flows to account for the effects of viscous stresses in both the azimuthal and radial directions. Our method is verified by reproducing the best results obtained previously by SzuszkiewiczMiller on the limit-cycle behavior of thermally unstable accretion disks with moderate viscosity. A new finding is that, according to our computations, the Bernoulli function of the matter in such disks is always and everywhere negative, so that outflows are unlikely to originate from these disks. We are encouraged to study the more difficult case of thermally unstable accretion disks with strong viscosity, and wish to report our results in a subsequent paper. ",0,1
"During the whole of 1874, Camille Jordan and Leopold Kronecker quar- relled vigorously over the organisation of the theory of bilinear forms. That theory promised a 'general' and 'homogeneous' treatment of numerous questions arising in various 19th-century theoretical contexts, and it hinged on two theorems, stated independently by Jordan and Weierstrass, that would today be considered equivalent. It was, however, the perceived difference between those two theorems that sparked the 1874 controversy. Focusing on this quarrel allows us to explore the algebraic identity of the polynomial practices of the manipulations of forms in use before the advent of structural approaches to linear algebra. The latter approaches identified these practices with methods for the classification of similar matrices. We show that the prac- tices – Jordan's canonical reduction and Kronecker's invariant computation – reflect identities inseparable from the social context of the time. Moreover, these practices reveal not only tacit knowledge, local ways of thinking, but also – in light of a long history tracing back to the work of Lagrange, Laplace, Cau- chy, and Hermite – two internal philosophies regarding the significance of generality which are inseparable from two disciplinary ideals opposing algebra and arithmetic. By interrogating the cultural identities of such practices, this study aims at a deeper understanding of the history of linear algebra without focusing on issues related to the origins of theories or structures.

"We present new results on dynamical instabilities in rapidly rotating neutron-stars. In particular, using numerical simulations in full General Relativity, we analyse the effects that the stellar compactness has on the threshold for the onset of the dynamical bar-mode instability, as well as on the appearance of other dynamical instabilities. By using an extrapolation technique developed and tested in our previous study [1], we explicitly determine the threshold for a wide range of compactnesses using four sequences of models of constant baryonic mass comprising a total of 59 stellar models. Our calculation of the threshold is in good agreement with the Newtonian prediction and improves the previous post-Newtonian estimates. In addition, we find that for stars with sufficiently large mass and compactness, the m=3 deformation is the fastest growing one. For all of the models considered, the non-axisymmetric instability is suppressed on a dynamical timescale with an m=1 deformation dominating the final stages of the instability. These results, together with those presented in [1], suggest that an m=1 deformation represents a general and late-time feature of non-axisymmetric dynamical instabilities both in full General Relativity and in Newtonian gravity.

"The apparent contradiction between the recently observed weak charge disproportion and the traditional Mn^3+/Mn^4+ picture of the charge-orbital orders in half-doped manganites is resolved by a novel Wannier states analysis of the LDA+U electronic structure. Strong electron itinerancy in this charge-transfer system significantly delocalizes the occupied low-energy 'Mn^3+' Wannier states such that charge leaks into the 'Mn^4+'-sites. Furthermore, the leading mechanisms of the charge order are quantified via our first-principles derivation of the low-energy effective Hamiltonian. The electron-electron interaction is found to play a role as important as the electron-lattice interaction. A general picture of doped holes in strongly correlated charge-transfer systems is presented and applied to the study of charge order in half-doped manganites, using a novel Wannier states analysis of the LDA+U electronic structure. While residing primarily in the oxygen atoms, the doped holes form additional effective e_g orbitals at the low-energy scale, leading to an effective Mn^3+/Mn^4+ valence picture that enables weak charge disproportion, resolving the current serious contradictions between the recent experimental observations of charge distribution and traditional models. Furthermore, the leading mechanisms of the observed charge order are quantified via our first-principles derivation of the low-energy effective Hamiltonian ",0,1
"The measurement of the scale of the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the galaxy power spectrum as a function of redshift is a promising method to constrain the equation-of-state parameter of the dark energy w. To measure the scale of the BAO precisely, a substantial volume of space must be surveyed. We test whether light-cone effects are important and whether the scaling relations used to compensate for an incorrect reference cosmology are in this case sufficiently accurate. We investigate the degeneracies in the cosmological parameters and the benefits of using the two-dimensional anisotropic power spectrum. Finally, we estimate the uncertainty with which w can be measured by proposed surveys at redshifts of about z=3 and z=1, respectively.In the simulated survey we find that light-cone effects are small and that the simple scaling relations used to correct for the cosmological distortion work fairly well even for large survey volumes. The analysis of the two-dimensional anisotropic power spectra enables an independent determination to be made of the apparent scale of the BAO, perpendicular and parallel to the line of sight. This is essential for two-parameter w-models, such as the redshift-dependent dark energy model w=w_0+(1-a)w_a. Using Planck priors for the matter and baryon density and Delta(H_0)=5",0,1
"We find three distinct phases; a tubular phase, a planar phase, and the spherical phase, in a triangulated fluid surface model. It is also found that these phases are separated by discontinuous transitions. The fluid surface model is investigated within the framework of the conventional curvature model by using the canonical Monte Carlo simulations with dynamical triangulations. The mechanical strength of the surface is given only by skeletons, and no two-dimensional bending energy is assumed in the Hamiltonian. The skeletons are composed of elastic linear-chains and rigid junctions and form a compartmentalized structure on the surface, and for this reason the vertices of triangles can diffuse freely only inside the compartments. As a consequence, an inhomogeneous structure is introduced in the model; the surface strength inside the compartments is different from the surface strength on the compartments. However, the rotational symmetry is not influenced by the elastic skeletons; there is no specific direction on the surface. In addition to the three phases mentioned above, a collapsed phase is expected to exist in the low bending rigidity regime that was not studied here. The inhomogeneous structure and the fluidity of vertices are considered to be the origin of such variety of phases. ",0,1
"When modeling the distribution of a set of data by a mixture of Gaussians, there are two possibilities: i) the classical one is using a set of parameters which are the proportions, the means and the variances; ii) the second is to consider the proportions as the probabilities of a discrete valued hidden variable. In the first case a usual prior distribution for the proportions is the Dirichlet which accounts for the fact that they have to sum up to one. In the second case, to each data is associated a hidden variable for which we consider two possibilities: a) assuming those variables to be i.i.d. We show then that this scheme is equivalent to the classical mixture model with Dirichlet prior; b) assuming a Markovian structure. Then we choose the simplest markovian model which is the Potts distribution. As we will see this model is more appropriate for the case where the data represents the pixels of an image for which the hidden variables represent a segmentation of that image. The main object of this paper is to give some details on these models and different algorithms used for their simulation and the estimation of their parameters.Key Words: Mixture of Gaussians, Dirichlet, Potts, Classification, Segmentation.

"It remains an open question how magnetic energy is rapidly released in the solar corona so as to create solar explosions such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Recent studies have confirmed that a system consisting of a flux rope embedded in a background field exhibits a catastrophic behavior, and the energy threshold at the catastrophic point may exceed the associated open field energy. The accumulated free energy in the corona is abruptly released when the catastrophe takes place, and it probably serves as the main means of energy release for CMEs at least in the initial phase. Such a release proceeds via an ideal MHD process in contrast with nonideal ones such as magnetic reconnection. The catastrophe results in a sudden formation of electric current sheets, which naturally provide proper sites for fast magnetic reconnection. The reconnection may be identified with a solar flare associated with the CME on one hand, and produces a further acceleration of the CME on the other. On this basis, several preliminary suggestions are made for future observational investigations, especially with the proposed KuaFu satellites, on the roles of the MHD catastrophe and magnetic reconnection in the magnetic energy release associated with CMEs and flares.

"The performance of telescope systems working at microwave or visible/IR wavelengths is typically described in terms of different parameters according to the wavelength range. Most commercial ray tracing packages have been specifically designed for use with visible/IR systems and thus, though very flexible and sophisticated, do not provide the appropriate parameters to fully describe microwave antennas, and thus to compare with specifications. In this work we demonstrate that the Strehl ratio is equal to the phase efficiency when the apodization factor is taken into account. The phase efficiency is the most critical contribution to the aperture efficiency of an antenna, and the most difficult parameter to optimize during the telescope design. The equivalence between the Strehl ratio and the phase efficiency gives the designer/user of the telescope the opportunity to use the faster commercial ray-tracing software to optimize the design. We also discuss the results of several tests performed to check the validity of this relationship that we carried out using a ray-tracing software, ZEMAX and a full Physical Optics software, GRASP9.3, applied to three different telescope designs that span a factor of ≃ 10 in terms of D/lambda. The maximum measured discrepancy between phase efficiency and Strehl ratio varies between≃0.4 and 1.9 up to an offset angle of >40 beams, depending on the optical configuration, but it is always less than 0.5 where the Strehl ratio is >0.95.

"In the LCDM cosmology dark matter halos grow primarily through the accretion of smaller halos. Much of the mass in a halo of 10^14Msun comes in through accretion of10^13Msun halos. If each such halo hosted one luminous red galaxy (LRG) then the accretion of so many halos is at odds with the observed number of LRGs in clusters unless these accreted LRGs merge or disrupt on relatively short timescales ( 2Gyr). These timescales are consistent with classical dynamical friction arguments, and imply that 2-3 LRGs have merged or disrupted within each halo more massive than 10^14Msun by z=0. The total amount of stellar mass brought into these massive halos by z=0 is consistent with observations once the intracluster light (ICL) is included. If disrupted LRGs build up the ICL, then the hierarchical growth of massive halos implies that a substantial amount of ICL should also surround satellite LRGs, as suggested by recent observations of the Virgo cluster. Finally, we point out that these results are entirely consistent with a non-evolving clustering strength and halo occupation distribution, and note that observations of the latter in fact support the hypothesis that merging/disruption of massive galaxies does indeed take place at late times.

"We examine recent evidence from the luminosity-redshift relation of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) for the ∼ 3 σ detection of a “Hubble bubble” – a departure of the local value of the Hubble constant from its globally averaged value <cit.>. By comparing the MLCS2k2 fits used in that study to the results from other light-curve fitters applied to the same data, we demonstrate that this is related to the interpretation of SN color excesses (after correction for a light-curve shape-color relation) and the presence of a color gradient across the local sample. If the slope of the linear relation (β) between SN color excess and luminosity is fit empirically, then the bubble disappears. If, on the other hand, the color excess arises purely from Milky Way-like dust, then SN data clearly favors a Hubble bubble. We demonstrate that SN data give β≃ 2, instead of the β≃ 4 one would expect from purely Milky-Way-like dust. This suggests that either SN intrinsic colors are more complicated than can be described with a single light-curve shape parameter, or that dust around SN is unusual. Disentangling these possibilities is both a challenge and an opportunity for large-survey SN Ia cosmology. ",0,1
"We apply the Lunin–Maldacena construction of gravity duals to beta-deformed gauge theories to a class of Type IIB backgrounds with U(1)^3 global symmetry, which include the multicenter D3-brane backgrounds dual to the Coulomb branch of N=4 super Yang-Mills and the rotating D3-brane backgrounds dual to the theory at finite temperature and chemical potential. After a general discussion, we present the full form of the deformed metrics for three special cases, which can be used for the study of various aspects of the marginally-deformed gauge theories. We also construct the Penrose limits of the solutions dual to the Coulomb branch along a certain set of geodesics and, for the resulting PP–wave metrics, we examine the effect of beta-deformations on the giant graviton states. We find that giant gravitons exist only up to a critical value of the sigma-deformation parameter, are not degenerate in energy with the point graviton, and remain perturbatively stable. Finally, we probe the sigma-deformed multicenter solutions by examining the static heavy-quark potential by means of Wilson loops. We find situations that give rise to complete screening as well as linear confinement, with the latter arising is an intriguing way reminiscent of phase transitions in statistical systems. ",0,1
"H-index, proposed by Hirsch is a good indicator of the impact of a scientist's research. When evaluating departments, institutions or labs, the importance of h-index can be further enhanced when properly calibrated for size. Particularly acute is the issue of federally funded facilities whose number of actively publishing scientists frequently dwarfs that of academic departments. Recently Molinari and Molinari developed a methodology that shows the h-index has a universal growth rate for large numbers of papers, allowing for meaningful comparisons between institutions.An additional challenge when comparing large institutions is that fields have distinct internal cultures, with different typical rates of publication and citation; biology is more highly cited than physics, which is more highly cited than engineering. For this reason, this study has focused on the physical sciences, engineering, and technology, and has excluded bio-medical research. Comparisons between individual disciplines are reported here to provide contextual framework. Generally, it was found that the universal growth rate of Molinari and Molinari holds well across all the categories considered, testifying to the robustness of both their growth law and our results.The overall goal here is to set the highest standard of comparison for federal investment in science; comparisons are made with the nations preeminent private and public institutions. We find that many among the national facilities compare favorably in research impact with the nations leading universities. ",0,1

"The corrections to g-mode frequencies caused by the presence of a central magnetic field and rotation of the Sun are calculated. The calculations are carried out in the simple one dimensional magnetohydrodynamical model using the approximations which allow one to find the purely analytical spectra of magneto-gravity waves beyond the scope of the JWKB approximation and avoid in a small background magnetic field the appearance of the cusp resonance which locks a wave within the radiative zone. These analytic results are compared with the satellite observations of the g-mode frequency shifts which are of the order one per cent as given in the GOLF experiment at the SoHO board. The main contribution turns out to be the magnetic frequency shift in the strong magnetic field which obeys the used approximations. In particular, the fixed magnetic field strength 700 KG results in the mentioned value of the frequency shift for the g-mode of the radial order n=-10. The rotational shift due to the Coriolis force appears to be small and does not exceed a fracton of per cent, α_Ω< 0.003. ",0,1
"We investigate the segregation of the extragalactic population via colour criteria to produce an efficient and inexpensive methodology to select specific source populations as a function of far-infrared flux. Combining galaxy evolution scenarios and a detailed spectral library of galaxies, we produce simulated catalogues incorporating segregation of the extragalactic population into component types (Normal, star-forming, AGN) via color cuts. As a practical application we apply our criteria to the deepest survey to be undertaken in the far-infrared with the AKARI (formerly ASTRO-F) satellite. Using the far-infrared wavebands of the Far-Infrared Surveyor (FIS, one of the focal-plane instruments on AKARI) we successfully segregate the normal, starburst and ULIRG populations. We also show that with additional MIR imaging from AKARI's Infrared Camera (IRC), significant contamination and/or degeneracy can be further decreased and show a particular example of the separation of cool normal galaxies and cold ULIRG sources. We conclude that our criteria provide an efficient means of selecting source populations (including rare luminous objects) and produce colour-segregated source counts without the requirement of time intensive ground-based follow up to differentiate between the general galaxy population.

"In recent years, the availability of highly pure stable isotopes has made possible the investigation of the dependence of the physical properties of crystals, in particular semiconductors, on their isotopic composition. Following the investigation of the specific heat (C_p, C_v) of monatomic crystals such as diamond, silicon, and germanium, similar investigations have been undertaken for the tetrahedral diatomic systems ZnO and GaN (wurtzite structure), for which the effect of the mass of the cation differs from that of the anion. In this article we present measurements for a semiconductor with rock salt structure, namely lead sulfide. Because of the large difference in the atomic mass of both constituents (M_ Pb= 207.21 and (M_ S=32.06 a.m.u., for the natural isotopic abundance) the effects of varying the cation and that of the anion mass are very different for this canonical semiconductor. We compare the measured temperature dependence of C_p ≈ C_v, and the corresponding derivatives with respect to (M_ Pb and M_ S), with ab initio calculations based on the lattice dynamics obtained from the local density approximation (LDA) electronic band structure. Quantitative deviations between theory and experiment are attributed to the absence of spin-orbit interaction in the ABINIT program used for the electronic band structure calculations. ",0,1
"I show that several observable properties of bursting neutron stars in metric theories of gravity can be calculated using only conservation laws, Killing symmetries, and the Einstein equivalence principle, without requiring the validity of the general relativistic field equations. I calculate, in particular, the gravitational redshift of a surface atomic line, the touchdown luminosity of a radius-expansion burst, which is believed to be equal to the Eddington critical luminosity, and the apparent surface area of a neutron star as measured during the cooling tails of bursts. I show that, for a general metric theory of gravity, the apparent surface area of a neutron star depends on the coordinate radius of the stellar surface and on its gravitational redshift in the exact same way as in general relativity. On the other hand, the Eddington critical luminosity depends also on an additional parameter that measures the degree to which the general relativistic field equations are satisfied. These results can be used in conjunction with current and future high-energy observations of bursting neutron stars to test general relativity in the strong-field regime. ",0,1
"The high volume of packets and packet rates of traffic on some router links makes it exceedingly difficult for routers to examine every packet in order to keep detailed statistics about the traffic which is traversing the router. Sampling is commonly applied on routers in order to limit the load incurred by the collection of information that the router has to undertake when evaluating flow information for monitoring purposes. The sampling process in nearly all cases is a deterministic process of choosing 1 in every N packets on a per-interface basis, and then forming the flow statistics based on the collected sampled statistics. Even though this sampling may not be significant for some statistics, such as packet rate, others can be severely distorted. However, it is important to consider the sampling techniques and their relative accuracy when applied to different traffic patterns. The main disadvantage of sampling is the loss of accuracy in the collected trace when compared to the original traffic stream. To date there has not been a detailed analysis of the impact of sampling at a router in various traffic profiles and flow criteria. In this paper, we assess the performance of the sampling process as used in NetFlow in detail, and we discuss some techniques for the compensation of loss of monitoring detail. ",0,1
"We consider a system composed of a trapped atom and a trapped ion. The ion charge induces in the atom an electric dipole moment, which attracts it with an r^-4 dependence at large distances. In the regime considered here, the characteristic range of the atom-ion interaction is comparable or larger than the characteristic size of the trapping potential, which excludes the application of the contact pseudopotential. The short-range part of the interaction is described in the framework of quantum-defect theory, by introducing some short-range parameters, which can be related to the s-wave scattering length. When the separation between traps is changed we observe trap-induced shape resonances between molecular bound states and vibrational states of the external trapping potential. Our analysis is extended to quasi-one-dimensional geometries, when the scattering exhibit confinement-induced resonances, similar to the ones studied before for short-range interactions. For quasi-one-dimensional systems we investigate the effects of coupling between the center of mass and relative motion, which occurs for different trapping frequencies of atom and ion traps. Finally, we show how the two types of resonances can be employed for quantum state control and spectroscopy of atom-ion molecules. ",0,1

Clusters in the bimodal regime undergo strong radiative cooling within their densest inner regions, which results in the accumulation of the matter injected by supernovae and stellar winds and eventually in the formation of further stellar generations, while their outer regions sustain a stationary wind. The analytic formulae are derived from the basic hydrodynamic equations. Our main assumption, that the density at the star cluster surface scales almost linearly with that at the stagnation radius, is based on results from semi-analytic and full numerical calculations. The analytic formulation allows for the determination of the threshold mechanical luminosity that separates clusters evolving in either of the two solutions. It is possible to fix the stagnation radius by simple analytic expressions and thus to determine the fractions of the deposited matter that clusters evolving in the bimodal regime blow out as a wind or recycle into further stellar generations.

"An overview of game-theoretic approaches to energy-efficient resource allocation in wireless networks is presented. Focusing on multiple-access networks, it is demonstrated that game theory can be used as an effective tool to study resource allocation in wireless networks with quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. A family of non-cooperative (distributed) games is presented in which each user seeks to choose a strategy that maximizes its own utility while satisfying its QoS requirements. The utility function considered here measures the number of reliable bits that are transmitted per joule of energy consumed and, hence, is particulary suitable for energy-constrained networks. The actions available to each user in trying to maximize its own utility are at least the choice of the transmit power and, depending on the situation, the user may also be able to choose its transmission rate, modulation, packet size, multiuser receiver, multi-antenna processing algorithm, or carrier allocation strategy. The best-response strategy and Nash equilibrium for each game is presented. Using this game-theoretic framework, the effects of power control, rate control, modulation, temporal and spatial signal processing, carrier allocation strategy and delay QoS constraints on energy efficiency and network capacity are quantified.

"KS 1741-293, discovered in 1989 by the X-ray camera TTM in the Kvant module of the Mir space station and identified as an X-ray burster, has not been detected in the hard X band until the advent of the INTEGRAL observatory. Moreover this source has been recently object of scientific discussion, being also associated to a nearby extended radio source that in principle could be the supernova remnant produced by the accretion induced collapse in the binary system. Our long term monitoring with INTEGRAL, covering the period from February 2003 to May 2005, confirms that KS 1741-293 is transient in soft and hard X band. When the source is active, from a simultaneous JEM-X and IBIS data analysis, we provide a wide band spectrum from 5 to 100 keV, that can be fit by a two component model, a multiple blackbody for the soft emission and a Comptonized or a cut-off power law model for the hard component. Finally, by the detection of two X-ray bursters with JEM-X, we confirm the bursting nature of KS 1741-293, including this source in the class of the hard tailed X-ray bursters. ",0,1
We predict the nature (attractive or repulsive) and range (exponentially screened or long-range power law) of the electrostatic interactions of oppositely charged and planar plates as a function of the salt concentration and surface charge densities (whose absolute magnitudes are not necessarily equal). An analytical expression for the crossover between attractive and repulsive pressure is obtained as a function of the salt concentration. This condition reduces to the high-salt limit of Parsegian and Gingell where the interaction is exponentially screened and to the zero salt limit of Lau and Pincus in which the important length scales are the inter-plate separation and the Gouy-Chapman length. In the regime of low salt and high surface charges we predict - for any ratio of the charges on the surfaces - that the attractive pressure is long-ranged as a function of the spacing. The attractive pressure is related to the decrease in counter-ion concentration as the inter-plate distance is decreased. Our theory predicts several scaling regimes with different scaling expressions for the pressure as function of salinity and surface charge densities. The pressure predictions can be related to surface force experiments of oppositely charged surfaces that are prepared by coating one of the mica surfaces with an oppositely charged polyelectrolyte. ,0,1
"We apply a previously developed Gibbs sampling framework to the foreground corrected 3-yr WMAP polarization data and compute the power spectrum and residual foreground template amplitude posterior distributions. We first analyze the co-added Q- and V-band data, and compare our results to the likelihood code published by the WMAP team. We find good agreement, and thus verify the numerics and data processing steps of both approaches. However, we also analyze the Q- and V-bands separately, allowing for non-zero EB cross-correlations and including two individual foreground template amplitudes tracing synchrotron and dust emission. In these analyses, we find tentative evidence of systematics: The foreground tracers correlate with each of the Q- and V-band sky maps individually, although not with the co-added QV map; there is a noticeable negative EB cross-correlation at l <16 in the V-band map; and finally, when relaxing the constraints on EB and BB, noticeable differences are observed between the marginalized band powers in the Q- and V-bands. Further studies of these features are imperative, given the importance of the low-l EE spectrum on the optical depth of reionization tau and the spectral index of scalar perturbations n_s. ",0,1
"We present our work on pairing based cooling of Fermi gases. The motivation for this research arises from the need to achieve lower temperatures and higher density in ultracold atomic gases. This field aims to study the behavior of gases at temperatures close to absolute zero, where classical physics can no longer accurately explain their behaviors. Studies have shown that Fermi gases can be cooled below their Fermi temperature by pairing fermions into composite bosons.The key idea behind our work is to make use of this pairing mechanism to cool the Fermi gas even further. We propose to control the interaction between the fermions and the composite bosons by tuning external magnetic fields. Our methodology involves using numerical simulations to study the thermalization time scale of the Bose-Fermi mixture, as well as the overall cooling efficiency.The problem we attempt to solve is the lack of efficient cooling methods for Fermi gases. Our pairing-based cooling scheme offers a new avenue to achieve this goal. By using composite bosons to reduce the number of fermions, we can increase the density of the gas for a given temperature. Our results show that this method is effective in cooling a Fermi gas to lower temperatures than traditional cooling methods. We believe that our work has the potential to contribute to the development of more efficient cooling methods for ultracold atomic gases.",1,0
"In this study, we present new evidence of recent feedback energy release in the cores of two elliptical galaxies based on Spitzer observations of the transient, extended dust. The key ideas behind our research are to investigate the mechanisms powering the high-energy processes in the nuclei of early-type galaxies and to understand their impact on the interstellar medium (ISM). The methodology employed in this work involves the analysis of imaging and spectroscopic data obtained with the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) instrument on board the Spitzer Space Telescope. We detect extended dust features in the nuclei of NGC 5419 and IC 4296 that are spatially associated with outflows of hot gas and X-ray emission, indicative of an active galactic nucleus (AGN). Furthermore, we find that these dust structures have properties consistent with the presence of newly formed dust grains that have been heated by the AGN. The motivation for this study is to better understand the interplay between the AGN and the ISM in early-type galaxies, as this relationship has significant implications for galaxy evolution and the growth of supermassive black holes. Overall, our work represents a step forward in our understanding of feedback processes in galaxy cores, and sheds light on the physical conditions under which dust can be created and destroyed in these environments.",1,0
"In this study, we present the results of Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys (HST/ACS) coronagraphic observations of the dust surrounding HD 100546. The focus of our work is on the structure and morphology of the circumstellar dust disk and its interaction with a putative giant planet. The disk around HD 100546, which is known to contain evidence of both grain growth and dynamical interaction, presents a unique laboratory for investigating planet-disk interactions at an unusually advanced stage. Our observations reveal a relatively bright inner ring region that corresponds in location with a sharp rise in the spectral energy distribution. We found evidence for a gap beyond the ring, presumably carved by a massive protoplanet, and scattered light from dust particles presumably being displaced by the putative planet. The detailed structure of the disk is consistent with the presence of a relatively massive giant planet which injects sufficient energy to open a gap in the disk and simultaneously triggers the growth of a large inner ring via the Rossby vortices mechanism. Our findings suggest that HD 100546 represents a benchmark system to understand the formation and evolution of young Jupiter-like planets.",1,0
"In this research, we have investigated the optical properties of Er3+ doped alkali-chloro phosphate glasses for optical amplifiers. The motivation for this study was the need for cost-effective and efficient optical amplifiers in the optical communication industry. Erbium (Er3+) offers excellent amplification characteristics at the communication wavelength of 1550 nm, making it an ideal candidate for optical amplifiers.The work attempts to solve the issue of signal attenuation in optical fibers, which occurs due to the long transmission distance. The attenuation of the optical signal can cause a decrease in its strength, resulting in signal loss and degradation. The use of Er3+ doped glasses as optical amplifiers can help to overcome this problem by boosting the signal strength and decreasing the signal loss.Our study revealed that the Er3+ doped alkali-chloro phosphate glasses exhibited strong absorption and emission characteristics in the communication wavelength region. We analyzed the absorption and emission spectra, along with the Judd-Ofelt parameters, to characterize the glasses' optical properties. The glasses showed a high stimulated emission cross-section and a large gain coefficient, indicating their suitability for optical amplification.In conclusion, we have demonstrated the feasibility of Er3+ doped alkali-chloro phosphate glasses for optical amplification applications.

"In our work, we investigate the origin of magnetoelectric behavior in BiFeO_3, a material that exhibits remarkable properties, such as a large magnetoelectric effect coupled with multiferroic properties. The motivation behind this research is the immense potential for technological applications, such as data storage, spintronics, and sensor devices. Despite several attempts, the specific mechanism governing the magnetoelectric behavior in BiFeO_3 is still unresolved. Thus, our work aims to solve this crucial problem.We employ a combination of experimental and theoretical methods to identify the fundamental principles resulting in the magnetoelectric coupling. Our methodology includes first-principles calculations utilizing density-functional theory, X-ray resonant magnetic scattering, and magneto-transport measurements. Through these techniques, we find that the BiFeO_3 crystal structure is a contributing factor to its magnetic behavior, with Fe^3+ ions experiencing both electric and magnetic fields simultaneously, resulting in the magnetocristalline anisotropy. Furthermore, our research highlights the importance of spin-orbit interactions in understanding the multiferroic properties of BiFeO_3.In conclusion, our work provides crucial insights into the fundamental mechanisms underlying magnetoelectric behavior in BiFeO_3.

"We present a study on the gas-grain chemistry occurring in cold interstellar cloud cores, employing a microscopic Monte Carlo approach to surface chemistry. The main objective of our work is to understand the chemical evolution of such cloud cores by modeling the physical-chemical interactions between gas-phase species and the interstellar dust grains. Our motivation stems from the fact that these molecular clouds, containing a large amount of molecular hydrogen, are believed to be the birthplace of new stars and planets; therefore, studying the chemical evolution of these regions can help us understand the origins of life in the universe.We employ an improved version of the KMC (kinetic Monte Carlo) method, which allows for a more realistic modelling of the surface chemistry on interstellar dust grains, taking into account the physical and chemical properties of the surface sites. Our results show that the gas-phase species can readily adsorb onto the dust grain surfaces, with formation of molecular hydrogen being the dominant process. Furthermore, we find that the density of the gas-phase species and the surface temperature have a significant influence on the chemical evolution of these regions.Overall, our study provides deeper insight into the chemical processes occurring in cold interstellar cloud cores, and can assist in the comprehension of the chemical and physical conditions necessary for the formation of organic molecules and their relevance to the origin of life.",1,0
"In this work, we attempt to construct Landau (Γ,χ)-automorphic functions on ℂ^n with a certain magnitude ν. The motivation for this research comes from the importance of automorphic functions in various areas of mathematics such as number theory and representation theory.

"In this study, we investigate the formation and collapse of quiescent cloud cores induced by dynamic compressions. The motivation for our research is to better understand the key physical processes that trigger the formation and collapse of quiescent cloud cores. These cores are crucial in the formation of stars, planets, and other astronomical objects. Identifying the factors that contribute to the formation and collapse of these cloud cores, as well as understanding the dynamics of their evolution, will ultimately improve our understanding of the universe and how it has evolved over time.Our key approach in this work involves numerical simulations, which allow us to investigate the behavior of cloud cores under dynamic compression conditions. We employ a three-dimensional, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation model to study the effect of compressing a pre-existing cloud core. Our simulation setup includes a hydrostatic initial equilibrium cloud that is subjected to a pulse-driven shock compression. By tracking the evolution of the cloud core under these conditions, we are able to analyze the mechanisms that drive its formation and collapse.The problem that this work attempts to solve is the lack of a comprehensive understanding of the physical processes that govern the formation and collapse of quiescent cloud cores. By studying these processes within the framework of our simulation model, we aim to develop a more detailed understanding of these phenomena and their role in the formation of astronomical objects. Our findings will be relevant to researchers studying the evolution of the universe and the conditions that led to the formation of stars and other celestial bodies.",1,0
"In this study, we analyzed the nature of the short duration Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) 050906. The primary objective of the study was to uncover the physical mechanism behind the burst and its characteristics. We first investigated the spectral properties of this event using data obtained from various observatories, such as the Swift satellite. After a detailed analysis, we discovered that GRB 050906 was a single pulse event with a very hard spectrum, indicating high-energy photons.To explain the observed spectral characteristics of this GRB, we proposed a model that involves the synchrotron radiation of charged particles in a magnetic field. We further applied the synchrotron self-Compton model to explain the high-energy emission observed in this event. Our findings suggest that the magnetic field was likely to be the dominant factor in the production of this GRB.Through this study, we hope to provide a better understanding of the nature of short-duration gamma-ray bursts and their physical mechanisms. This research adds to the growing body of knowledge on astrophysics, especially in high-energy astronomy.

"In this work, we present an extensive study on the modelling effects and observational biases that can significantly affect Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) profiles and scaling relations within galaxy clusters. Our motivation for conducting this research lies in the need to better understand the SZ effect; a phenomenon that has become an essential tool in the measurement of cluster properties. However, the SZ effect is prone to various biases, including contamination by radio sources, calibration uncertainties, and astrophysical uncertainties affecting the modelling of the intracluster medium. Therefore, this work attempts to address these potential biases and modelling effects in SZ profiles to improve astrophysical interpretations and measurements and investigate the uncertainties in scaling relations.We use a sophisticated set of simulations to examine various bias and modelling effects that are not always taken into account in observational studies. Additionally, we calculate scaling relations and use them to create mock SZ catalogues that can be compared to real observational data to examine the impact of these effects on surveys. Our results show that the observed SZ profiles have uncertainties of up to 8",1,0
"In this paper, we present a novel wavelet-based algorithm, TRUFAS (Transit Real-time Unsuper-vised Frequency Analysis System), for the fast detection of planetary transits. The search for exoplanets by transit methods is crucial, but the current state-of-the-art algorithms for transit detection are computationally expensive, and their performance decreases with the amount of data analyzed. Our proposed algorithm overcomes this problem by processing large amounts of data in a short time, without sacrificing detection efficiency.The TRUFAS algorithm uses a wavelet-based technique to identify transit-like signals in the time series data. It works in the frequency domain to remove strong systematic errors during the search process. Based on tests done on simulated data and real data, we confirmed that TRUFAS performs better or as well as other algorithms, including the Box Least-Squares (BLS) algorithm. We compared the computed ranks of all algorithms on the same datasets and applied a reliability test to quantify their detection capabilities. The TRUFAS algorithm obtained a high RMS improvement percentage compared to other algorithms, signifying its superior transit detection efficiency.In conclusion, TRUFAS is a powerful tool for the large-scale transit search in the era of big data astronomy. The proposed algorithm overcomes computational limitations of traditional transit detection methods while being efficient and accurate. Furthermore, with its built-in frequency-based error correction and detection reliability assessment, TRUFAS can accelerate the discovery of new exoplanets.",1,0
"In this work, we present a detailed analysis of generic gravitational wave signals produced by the collapse of rotating stellar cores. The motivation behind this research is twofold. Firstly, rotating stellar cores are expected to be the progenitors of many astrophysical events that produce detectable gravitational waves, such as core-collapse supernovae and black hole formation. Secondly, existing models for predicting these signals are limited in their applicability and accuracy, and there is a need to develop more robust and general models.To address this, we use numerical simulations to study the collapse of rotating polytropic stars, varying the equation of state, initial conditions, and rotation rates. We use the spectral Einstein code to compute the gravitational wave signals produced by the collapse, identifying key features in the waveforms such as the presence of multiple oscillations, quasi-normal modes, and frequency modulations. Additionally, we investigate the impact of different parameters on the signal properties, such as the rotational energy and the equation of state.Our results demonstrate a clear connection between the properties of the collapsing star and the resulting gravitational wave signals, highlighting the importance of considering rotating stellar cores as a source of generic gravitational wave signals. This study provides a new framework for understanding and predicting the gravitational wave signals produced by core-collapse events, with potential applications in the field of gravitational wave astronomy.",1,0
"In this study, we aim to determine the optimal window for the 2MASS dipole. The 2MASS dipole is a variation in the cosmic microwave background that is used to measure the velocity of the Sun with respect to the reference frame of the Universe. This measurement is essential for accurately determining the cosmic microwave background spectrum and testing for deviations from the standard model of cosmology. However, determining the optimal window for the 2MASS dipole is a non-trivial task.Our key idea is to use a Bayesian approach to estimate the optimal window. This method involves creating a model for the dipole signal and comparing it to observed data. We use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to sample the posterior distribution of the model parameters, which allows us to estimate the optimal window on the basis of the evidence.Our methodology involved analyzing the data from the WMAP and Planck missions and comparing it to our model for the dipole signal. We found that the optimal window for the 2MASS dipole is between 50 and 80 degrees, which is consistent with previous studies.In conclusion, our study presents a new approach for determining the optimal window for the 2MASS dipole. Our model for the dipole signal allowed us to estimate the optimal window on the basis of the evidence.

"The anonymity of online communications has become a leading topic of research in recent years. In this study, we examine the role of unstructured networks in providing anonymity to online users. Specifically, we investigate the use of mixes to enhance anonymity in online communications on such networks. Our work draws upon prior studies that have shown the promise of mixes in enhancing user anonymity on structured networks such as Tor. One of the main challenges in this work is the lack of established methodologies for analyzing the effectiveness of mixes on unstructured networks. We introduce and evaluate two different approaches for measuring the anonymity provided by mixes: a probability-based approach and a flow-based approach. Our results affirm that mixes can indeed provide enhanced anonymity on unstructured networks. However, we also identify some limitations of mixes on such networks. Notably, their efficiency can be limited by the topology of the underlying network, and they may be vulnerable to traffic analysis attacks. This study motivates further work in designing more efficient and secure mixes for unstructured networks.",1,0
"In this paper, we investigate the phenomenon of stochastic resonance (SR) in reaction-diffusion systems using the nonequilibrium-potential approach. SR is a phenomenon that occurs when the presence of noise in a system enhances its response to a weak input signal. Our study aims to explore the conditions under which SR can occur in reaction-diffusion systems.We employ the nonequilibrium-potential approach to analyze the response of our system to different levels of noise. The approach involves calculating the nonequilibrium potential of the system and using it to derive the system's response to weak inputs.

"We present our analysis of the radio through X-ray Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) of 38 Broad Absorption Line (BAL) quasars. The motivation for this study was to investigate the nature of the BAL outflows and their relationship with the accretion processes in quasars. BAL quasars are a rare type of quasar characterized by the presence of broad absorption lines in their spectra, originating from high-velocity outflows of ionized gas from the central engine. We obtained radio, optical, ultraviolet, and X-ray data from various surveys and performed spectral fitting using a self-consistent model to generate the SEDs. Our results indicate that all BAL quasars in our sample show a lack of significant radio emission compared to other types of quasars. The majority of BAL quasars are also harder in the X-ray band, which is consistent with a primary X-ray emission mechanism originating from a hot corona. We also found that the BAL outflows seem to have weaker kinetic power than those in non-BAL quasars. Our key idea is that these results support the idea that BAL outflows are triggered by the accretion process, rather than by feedback mechanisms. Our methodology is based on a multi-wavelength approach that allowed us to disentangle the various physical components contributing to the SEDs.",1,0
"In this work, we investigate the possibility of obtaining a Massive CP^1 theory starting from a microscopic model for doped antiferromagnets. Our main goal is to find a Lagrangian that describes the low-energy behavior of spin excitations in a doped antiferromagnet. The starting point is a Z_2 lattice gauge theory with a spinon Fermi surface, which is believed to describe the low-energy behavior of the CuO_2 planes in cuprate superconductors. We show that by integrating out the gauge fields, one obtains an effective action for the spinons that has the form of a Massive CP^1 theory. Our approach is based on the large-N limit of the spinon theory, where N is the number of spin components. We argue that the resulting effective action is valid for small doping, where the Fermi surface is still well-defined. We then derive the equations of motion for the Massive CP^1 theory and study their properties. We find that the theory supports topological solitons, which can be interpreted as vortices in the spin texture. Our results provide a new perspective on the physics of doped antiferromagnets and may shed light on the origins of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates.",1,0
"In this paper, we investigate the continuum limit of polymer quantum mechanics. The aim of our work is to better understand the quantum behavior of polymers and its relationship to the classical theory. Our research attempts to clarify the nature of the continuum limit and determine the correctness of the approximations made. Specifically, we study the connectivity of the polymer strands. We find that a continuous path can be defined in the polymer configuration space, which is essential for the polymer to display continuum behavior. We show that the approximation of continuous randomness in the spatial variable can certainly be used when the polymer is stretched out over a significant distance. For a coil-like polymer, our results demonstrate that its behavior is non-classical.Our methodology involves a careful combination of intuition, formalism, and numerical simulations. We evaluate a path integral representation of polymer quantum mechanics in the continuum limit, and use numerical simulations to support our results. The ideas proposed in this work are relevant to the understanding of the thermodynamic properties of polymers, as well as to quantum computing and information. The findings of this work present a theoretical framework for the investigation of other polymer properties that are still poorly understood.",1,0
"We present a study on the bulk viscosity of cold quark matter in the color-flavor locked phase (CFL) in this paper. Our main motivation for investigating the bulk viscosity of CFL matter is to understand the properties of quark star matter. We also aim to explore the possibility of using gravitational wave observations to infer the existence of quark stars. Despite the fact that CFL matter is not yet established to be present in the universe, its existence is backed up by theoretical work. Therefore, studying its properties is vital in ascertaining the properties of quark star matter.We discovered that the bulk viscosity of the CFL phase, unlike what is observed in normal fluids, is smaller than shear viscosity. This observation has significant implications for the behavior and dynamics of quark stars. Essentially, the damping time of processes like r-modes and ripples in gravitational waves will be much longer than previously considered. Our research aims to provide insight into the behavior of hot, dense quark matter and is a step towards understanding the characteristics of strange stars.Our study is the first to investigate the bulk viscosity of cold CFL matter. The insights provided by our work should be considered in future models of quark star stability and evolution.",1,0
"In this work, we match the WMAP 3-yrs results with the Cosmological Slingshot Primordial Spectrum. Our aim is to demonstrate how this approach is critical for cosmological parameter estimation. The Cosmological Slingshot Primordial Spectrum is a theoretical model for the primordial spectrum of perturbations, based on the slingshot mechanism operating in a contracting Universe. We use the Planck likelihood code and the MultiNest algorithm to perform parameter estimation. We also make use of a Bayesian evidence analysis to test the consistency of the model with the data.Our results show that this approach provides an excellent fit to the data. We obtain constraints on the cosmological parameters that are consistent with previous studies. We find that the model's predictions match the data for the overall amplitude of the primordial spectrum, as well as for its spectral index.The problem our work attempts to solve is the precise measurement of cosmological parameters using observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation.

A more accurate measurement of cosmological parameters can provide insights into the nature of dark matter, dark energy, and the overall structure of the Universe.",1,0
"In this work, we aim to reconcile the observations of two branches of neutron stars: the first, a high-mass pulsar with a mass of around 2 M_sun, and the second, a neutron star formed by the explosion of the supernova SN1987A, which has a lower mass. This discrepancy has puzzled physicists for years, and we want to provide a solution that helps us understand the underlying physics of neutron stars.The motivation for this research is clear: neutron stars are one of the most enigmatic objects in the universe, with extreme conditions that challenge our understanding of fundamental physics. Their properties, such as their mass, radius, and spin, can reveal the nature of the densest matter in the universe. However, current models and simulations struggle to explain the existence of these two different branches.To tackle this problem, we propose a new theoretical framework that explains the two branches as the result of different physical mechanisms. In particular, we suggest that the high-mass pulsar was formed by a mechanism that enhances the mass of a newborn neutron star through a strong magnetic field, while SN1987A is the result of a failed core-collapse supernova that left a smaller neutron star.Our key idea is to use a combination of numerical simulations and analytical calculations to support this hypothesis. We also compare our results with the latest observations of neutron stars to validate the consistency of our model. Overall, this work provides a new perspective on the properties and formation mechanisms of neutron stars that can shed light on some of the most pressing questions in fundamental physics.",1,0
"In this work, we study the high-energy emission properties of jets and blazars in the context of the Extragalactic Background Light (EBL) using data from the upcoming Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST) and Energetic X-ray Imaging Survey Telescope (EXIST). The EBL is a diffuse radiation field that pervades the universe and can interact with gamma rays, leading to gamma-ray attenuation and absorption. Jets and blazars, on the other hand, are astrophysical sources that release highly energetic particles along their axes. They are known to emit gamma rays up to tens of TeV, and their emission properties can be influenced by the EBL. Our main motivation is to understand the interplay between these two astrophysical phenomena.We employ a multi-wavelength observational approach to study the spectral and temporal behavior of jets and blazars across different energy bands. Additionally, we carry out theoretical modeling to interpret our observations and extract physical information about the sources. Our results suggest that the EBL has a significant impact on the gamma-ray emission from blazars, which can be used to infer the EBL density. We also find evidence for spectral variability and flaring activity in several sources, which can provide insights into the acceleration and emission mechanisms of high-energy particles in jets and blazars. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for future surveys with GLAST and other high-energy observatories.",1,0
"Our work presents a novel string-derived Z' model with R-parity violation and stable proton as well as light neutrinos. The motivation for this research lies in the exploration of beyond the Standard Model scenarios and the resolution of certain drawbacks faced by existing models. We begin by constructing a new model using string theory techniques, incorporating a new symmetry U(1)B-L and a scalar field responsible for R-parity violation.Our analysis reveals several significant results. The new symmetry U(1)B-L allows for conservation of baryon number and lepton number in reactions, thus ensuring the stability of protons. The introduction of the scalar field responsible for R-parity violation leads to the production of light neutrinos, a long-standing challenge in many models.Our methodology involves the examination of the particle content, gauge symmetry, and Higgs structure of the new model. We further analyze the constraints imposed by experimental observations on the coupling parameters and mass scales of the model.Overall, our work presents a viable and consistent model with several unique features that addresses fundamental issues in the Standard Model. Our results provide fresh insights into the unification of forces and the origin of neutrino masses, compelling areas of research in theoretical physics and cosmology.",1,0
"In this study, we aimed to simulate heme using the Density Functional Theory plus Hubbard U correction (DFT+U) and investigate the accuracy of spin-state energetics. Heme is an essential protein in many biological processes, including oxygen transport and electron transfer. The accurate determination of its spin-state energetics is crucial for understanding its functional mechanism. However, the spin-state energetics of heme are a challenging problem because of the strong electron correlation effects. In this study, we first validated the DFT+U approach by comparing our results with experimental data. We then compared our calculations with those from the DFT approach, which neglects electron correlation effects, and found that the DFT+U approach consistently gave a lower energy for the high-spin state than the DFT approach. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the inclusion of U significantly improves the accuracy of the energy predictions by taking into account the electron correlation effects. These findings reveal the importance of including electron correlation effects in simulating spin-state energetics of heme, and the DFT+U approach provides a reliable method for such simulations. This work paves the way for more accurate simulations of heme and other systems with strong electron correlation effects, and thus contributes to the advancement of computational chemistry and materials science.",1,0
"We present an integral field spectroscopic study of the extended emission-line region (EELR) of the high redshift quasar 4C 37.43. Motivated by the need to gain a deeper understanding of the environment surrounding quasars at earlier cosmic times, we use observations obtained with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) instrument mounted on the Very Large Telescope (VLT). Our key idea is to study the EELR, a region of ionized gas located far beyond the host galaxy, through a spatially resolved analysis of its kinematic properties, line ratios and ionization mechanisms. Our methodology consists of a combination of techniques such as spectral extraction, flux calibration, continuum subtraction, and emission-line fitting, which together allow us to obtain a detailed spatially resolved picture of the EELR. Our results indicate the presence of complex kinematic patterns, including the detection of outflowing gas in close proximity to the quasar, as well as strong evidence for an ionization gradient within the EELR. Our findings suggest a possible connection between the quasar and the EELR, indicating that the EELR may be ionized by the quasar itself or by a collimated outflowing wind from the central engine.",1,0
"In this work, we investigate the use of Super-Poissonian Shot Noise (SPSN) as a measure of dephasing in closed quantum dots. The motivation for this research is to better understand the dephasing process in quantum dots, which is a crucial factor in determining their functionality and feasibility for technological applications.To this end, we performed a series of high-precision measurements of SPSN in a closed quantum dot system. Our results revealed that the SPSN signals in our system were strongly influenced by external noise sources, such as fluctuations in the environment and charge noise from nearby electronic devices. Despite these challenges, we were able to extract reliable SPSN measures, which allowed us to accurately estimate the dephasing time of our system. Our findings have important implications for the development of future quantum dot-based technologies, as they provide insights into the fundamental physics of quantum dot dephasing. The problem that our work attempts to solve is the development of reliable methods for characterizing dephasing in closed quantum dots, which is a key step towards the realization of robust quantum computing and other quantum-based technologies.",1,0
"In this paper, we propose a novel tool for seismologists, the Cumulative Spectral Power (CSP). Our motivation for this research stems from the inadequacy of current methods in identifying small earthquakes buried within noise and larger earthquakes. The CSP is designed to assist in readjusting a dataset in such a way that it highlights the frequency content of small earthquakes and at the same time dampens the frequency content of larger earthquakes and noise. The key idea of this new tool is that it enforces the idea that small earthquakes within a given frequency band can reveal substantive information about the subsurface structure of the Earth. The CSP is created using a moving time window and a cumulative distribution function of the spectral power. Our primary methodology for testing the effectiveness of the CSP is through numerical simulations and field data analysis, which shows that CSP can significantly improve the detection of small earthquakes. We anticipate that this new tool will be critical in unraveling the Earth's subsurface structures and aid seismologists in image reconstruction and monitoring earthquake activity.",1,0
"We present a novel approach in addressing the long-standing problem of calculating scattering amplitudes in strongly coupled (N=4) super Yang-Mills theory via semiclassical strings in anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. Our study aims to provide a deeper understanding of the holographic correspondence between the strongly coupled gauge theory and the weakly coupled gravitational theory in AdS/CFT, which is of utmost importance in developing a complete theory of quantum gravity.Using the formalism of the twistor-string theory, we derive a twistor-space representation of the semiclassical string partition function in AdS. By computing the semiclassical three-point amplitude of scattering states in AdS, we demonstrate the consistency of our approach with the standard CFT correlator calculation in the planar limit. Furthermore, we accurately verify the correspondence of semiclassical strings with the all-loop amplitudes in the gauge theory.Our work significantly advances the understanding of the AdS/CFT correspondence and provides new insights into the nature of string theory and quantum gravity. The methodology, based on the twistor-string formalism, opens new avenues for exploring string theory and gauge theory and lays the groundwork for future research in these fields.",1,0
"In this study, we investigate the radion phenomenology in realistic warped space models motivated by the theoretical and experimental challenges to explain the hierarchy of the fermion masses and the existing tension between the precision electroweak measurements and direct searches for new physics. We consider a five-dimensional Randall-Sundrum model with a bulk scalar and fermion fields and a brane-localized Higgs field. We show that the radion and KK-graviton excitations can have important implications for the collider and cosmological observables. In particular, we analyze the effective couplings and decay modes of the radion in the diphoton and diphoton+dijet channels at the Large Hadron Collider and explore the parameter space that can lead to a detectable signal. We find that the radion can have a significant contribution to the diphoton excess observed by ATLAS and CMS experiments around a mass of 750 GeV. Furthermore, we investigate the radion interactions with the cosmic microwave background and dark matter and show that the radion can have effects on the early universe and on the present-day abundance of dark matter. Our study provides insights into the rich phenomenology of warped extra dimensions and highlights the importance of future experimental and observational probes.Keywords: radion phenomenology, warped space models, Randall-Sundrum model, collider physics, dark matter.",1,0
"The present work offers a detailed optical and X-ray analysis of the cooling flow cluster Z3146, named ARCRAIDER I. Our analysis confirms a strong cD galaxy at the center of the cluster, surrounded by a cooling flow of gas. The spatially resolved spectral analysis shows that the intra-cluster medium (ICM) is hot in the cluster's center and cools down radially, reaching temperatures of around 2 keV at the edge. We also found a clear anti-correlation between temperature and metallicity, where the central ICM is enriched in heavy elements, while the outskirts hold a higher concentration of lighter elements.This research provides essential information about the complex processes involved in the cooling flow mechanism, which is vital for further understanding the evolution of galaxy clusters. Such analyses are necessary to comprehend the cooling flows' fundamental properties and their connection to the galaxy cluster properties. Additionally, studying the metallicity distribution in the ICM not only provides crucial information about the elemental abundances but also helps trace the history of star formation in the cluster.The results obtained in this work serve as a significant contribution to the ever-growing body of knowledge on cluster evolution and can serve as a launching point for further research in this field. The analysis presented here attempts to solve the problem of shedding light on the nature of cooling flows and metallicity distribution, which has been a long-standing source of debate and research in the cosmological community.",1,0
"In this study, we present the observation of electron-hole puddles (EHPs) in graphene using a scanning single electron transistor (SSET). Graphene has aroused great interest in the scientific community due to its unique electronic and physical properties. However, the understanding of its electronic behavior is still incomplete, and the investigation of EHPs is of utmost importance to elucidate the doping and scattering mechanisms in graphene. The problem we aim to solve is to provide a reliable and accurate method for imaging the local electronic properties of graphene, especially in the vicinity of defects or dopants. The key idea of our research is to employ a sensitive and high-resolution SSET as a probe to map the electrostatic potential in graphene and detect the local density of states (LDOS). The methodology consists of fabricating the SSET, depositing the graphene sample on a Si/SiO2 substrate, and scanning the SSET tip over the sample surface. Our results demonstrate the existence of EHPs in graphene and reveal their spatial distribution and size. Moreover, we show that the SSET can image EHPs with sub-10 nm resolution and quantitatively measure their LDOS.

"We present a study of the fundamental parameters of helium (He)-weak and He-strong stars. Our aim is to characterize the physical properties of these stars, which are known to have a strong impact on the understanding of stellar evolution. The methodology followed is based on spectral analysis, which allows us to derive the effective temperature, surface gravity, and chemical composition of the stars. Our sample comprises a total of 24 He-weak and 17 He-strong stars, which were analyzed using high-resolution spectroscopy data obtained with the VLT-UVES instrument. The results obtained show that He-weak stars have lower effective temperatures and surface gravities than normal stars, while He-strong stars have higher effective temperatures and surface gravities. We also find that He-strong stars exhibit enhanced metallicity, which suggests that their formation might be related to a specific chemical enrichment process. These findings are of great significance since they provide new insights into the physical properties of He-weak and He-strong stars, which may be useful to improve our understanding of the evolution of massive stars and the origin of chemical elements in the Universe.",1,0
"In this work, we investigate the phenomenon of Multiple Parton Scattering (MPS) in nuclei, specifically focusing on quark-quark scattering. The problem we aim to solve is to obtain a better understanding of the scattering process of quarks in a nuclear environment. While the concept of MPS has been extensively studied, the specific details of the quark-quark scattering process in atomic nuclei remain unclear.To tackle this problem, we employ a theoretical approach that utilizes the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) effective field theory. We calculate the MPS probability of a nucleon in a nucleus to suffer two or more scattering events with a second parton. We also investigate the impact parameter dependence of our model.Our results show that the MPS probability increases with the atomic number of the nucleus and the energy of the scattering event. Additionally, the impact parameter dependence of the MPS probability shows that the probability is higher for peripheral collisions. We further demonstrate that the introduction of a quark-quark scattering mechanism effectively damps the previously found enhancement of the n-parton distribution for small parton separations.In summary, our work provides insights into the quark-quark scattering process in nuclei by investigating the MPS phenomenon. We employ a theoretical framework that allows us to make quantitative predictions, with our results showing the atomic number and collision energy dependence of the MPS probability.

"In this work, we investigate the signatures of heavy Z-prime particles in an Extra U(1) Superstring Inspired Model (EUSIM). The EUSIM is a type of supersymmetric theory that incorporates an additional U(1) gauge symmetry beyond the Standard Model electroweak and strong interactions. The presence of this extra symmetry allows for the existence of heavy Z-prime particles, which could have significant implications for particle physics experiments and cosmology.We use the Renormalization Group Equation (RGE) analysis to study the behavior of the EUSIM with and without the inclusion of heavy Z-prime particles. We perform numerical calculations to analyze the running of the couplings and masses of the particle spectrum, including the Z-prime. We also investigate the RGE flow of the quartic coupling that governs the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the EUSIM.The motivation for this research is twofold. First, the EUSIM is a well-motivated theoretical framework that is consistent with the principles of string theory and could shed light on the physics of our universe. Second, the existence of heavy Z-prime particles could potentially be discovered in current or future particle accelerator experiments, and therefore it is crucial to understand their impact on the EUSIM.The problem that this work attempts to solve is to identify the signatures of heavy Z-prime particles in the EUSIM and to quantify their effects on the running of the couplings and masses of the particle spectrum. Our findings may have important implications for future experimental searches for new physics beyond the Standard Model.",1,0
"In this work, we investigate the relationship between dimer models, free fermions, and super quantum mechanics. Dimer models are a type of statistical mechanics model that describe the formation of dimers on a lattice, while free fermions are particles that obey Fermi-Dirac statistics and can move freely in a lattice. Super quantum mechanics, on the other hand, is a generalization of quantum mechanics that incorporates supersymmetry. We aim to understand how these three concepts are related and use this understanding to gain insights into the behavior of physical systems.To achieve this, we begin by introducing the mathematical framework for dimer models, free fermions, and super quantum mechanics. We then explore how these frameworks interact, focusing on the mathematics that underline their relationship. Our key idea is that certain dimer models have a hidden supersymmetry that emerges when they are described using free fermions. We formalize this relationship using mathematical tools, including complex analysis and representation theory.Our results show that understanding the relationship between dimer models, free fermions, and super quantum mechanics provides a new perspective on the behavior of physical systems. We demonstrate this by using our insights to address several open problems in statistical mechanics and condensed matter physics. Specifically, we use our understanding of supersymmetry in dimer models to predict the existence of certain phase transitions in materials science. We conclude with a discussion of the broader implications of our work, including its potential applications in fields such as quantum computing and high-energy physics.",1,0
"In this study, we present the design of parallel kinematic machine tools using kinetostatic performance criteria. Our aim is to improve the performance and accuracy of these machines, which are widely used in manufacturing and CNC machining operations. We adopt a fully analytical methodology, which enables us to optimize the design parameters for maximum performance.Our research is motivated by the need to improve the efficiency of parallel kinematic machines for industrial applications. These machines offer superior performance compared to conventional serial kinematic machines, but their design is more complex due to the presence of redundancies. Our approach focuses on identifying the optimal arrangements of these redundancies, while ensuring that the machines meet the kinetostatic performance criteria.Our results demonstrate that the proposed methodology is effective in designing high-performance parallel kinematic machines. We successfully identified the optimal kinematic arrangement for different types of machines, including 3RPU, 3RPR, and 3RRR. Moreover, we validated our designs using simulations and experiments, which showed that the machines achieve high accuracy and repeatability. Overall, our research contributes to the development of more advanced and efficient parallel kinematic machines for manufacturing and CNC machining applications.",1,0
"In this work titled 'Lyman Break Galaxies at z 5: Rest-frame UV Spectra II,' we present an analysis of 35 Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) at redshift z 5 using high-resolution spectroscopy obtained with the Keck telescope. The problem our work attempts to solve is the characterization of the physical properties and evolution of early galaxy populations during the cosmic reionization epoch, which is a critical period in the evolution of the Universe.The motivation for our research is to understand the emergence and evolution of galaxies and their contribution to the reionization of the Universe. Our work addresses this by studying the ionizing properties and dust content of high-redshift galaxies. We use data from the Keck telescope and extract the rest-frame UV spectra of the LBGs. We then measure the equivalent widths of spectral features, such as Lyman-alpha and SiIV lines.Our key findings suggest that LBGs at z 5 have dust attenuation levels similar to local star-forming galaxies. Furthermore, we find evidence for the presence of significant outflows in the young galaxies, implying that they could be potential sources of ionizing radiation and metal enrichment in the early Universe. Our methodology involves a combination of spectral analysis and comparison with local galaxy templates.Overall, our work sheds light on the physical properties and evolution of early galaxy populations, contributing to our understanding of the Universe's history and the crucial role of galaxies in driving cosmic reionization.",1,0
"In this work, we investigate the stringy E-functions of hypersurfaces and of Brieskorn singularities. Our aim is to provide a geometric interpretation and proof of the additivity theorem for the stringy E-function of a complete intersection. The key idea is to use toric geometry and the theory of Ehrhart polynomials to compute the stringy E-function of a hypersurface. We extend this computation to Brieskorn singularities using the theory of equivariant Ehrhart polynomials.We obtain explicit formulas for the stringy E-functions of certain types of hypersurfaces and Brieskorn singularities. In particular, we obtain the complete stringy E-function of the Brieskorn-Pham singularities. Our results have applications in mirror symmetry, degeneration techniques, and tropical geometry.The problem we attempt to solve is the one of characterizing the spectrum of the stringy E-function of a hypersurface. Our methodology is a combination of geometric and combinatorial techniques. We use toric geometry and the theory of Ehrhart polynomials in a novel way to obtain a new proof of the additivity theorem. The contribution of this work is a better understanding of the relationship between the geometry of a hypersurface or Brieskorn singularity and its stringy E-function.",1,0
"In this work, we present the absolute calibration and characterization of the Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS). The purpose is to establish an accurate calibration of MIPS to provide reliable measurements of the infrared sky. We focus on the stellar calibrator sample and the 24 micron calibration. The sample is composed of 50 stars carefully selected to provide a wide range of spectral types and brightnesses for a comprehensive analysis. The calibration includes the investigation of the same photometric measurement on different stars, eliminating instrumental and source-specific effects in the data.Our methodology consists of observing the calibrator sample with the MIPS instrument in two modes, scanning and staring. We analyze the data to obtain the calibration constants and correction factors that are applied to all MIPS sources. We compare the results with previous calibrations, indicating where there are discrepancies or uncertainties.Our results present a better characterization of the instrument and more reliable data products. We obtained a calibration that is consistent with previous ones, but with reduced uncertainties and additional factors. The methodology used provides a solid basis for further calibration of MIPS and other infrared instrumentation.",1,0
"In The Araucaria Project, we conducted a wide-field imaging survey of the WLM galaxy in the Local Group and used the luminosity variation of Cepheid variables to measure its distance accurately. Cepheids are pulsating stars whose periods of brightness variations are directly related to their intrinsic brightnesses. Therefore, by measuring their periods on high-quality images obtained over several years, we can calculate their distances from the Earth accurately. Our survey covered a 25-square-degree field around WLM with the Warsaw Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory to identify hundreds of Cepheid variables. The photometry of these variables is based on the high-quality images taken over six years with the MOSAIC II camera on the CTIO Blanco Telescope in the same field. Our analysis, which includes the period-luminosity relation calibration, provides the distance modulus of the WLM galaxy at 24.60 ± 0.05 mag. This result is consistent with the previous estimates of the WLM distance but has a dramatically reduced uncertainty. The Hubble constant value inferred from our distance modulus is also in a good agreement with other measurements from different sources. By resolving the WLM distance issue, we contribute to the precision cosmology experiments that seek accurate determination of our Universe's fundamental parameters.",1,0
"In this work, we investigate the possibility of obtaining an almost supersymmetric Standard Model from intersecting D6-branes on the Z_6' orientifold. We focus on the compactification of type IIA string theory on a toroidal background with orientifold planes. We consider a six-dimensional orbifold obtained by dividing a six-dimensional torus by a Z_6' orientation, which leads to orientifold planes and D6-branes at fixed points. We study the low-energy effective theory of the D6-branes and analyze the spectrum of chiral matter under the Standard Model gauge group. We find that the resulting spectrum contains all the particles of the Standard Model, except for the right-handed neutrinos, and that the Yukawa couplings are generated by instanton effects.Our work aims to address the problem of obtaining a realistic model of particle physics from string theory. The success of the Standard Model of particle physics in explaining the experimental data leaves little room for new physics beyond the Standard Model at low energies. String theory provides a consistent framework for quantum gravity that unifies all fundamental forces, but constructing a realistic model of particle physics from string theory is a challenging task.Our approach involves the use of intersecting D6-branes and the Z_6' orientifold, which is a particularly interesting model due to its rich phenomenology. Intersecting branes provide a geometric realization of the chiral matter spectrum, while the orientifold projection allows for the cancellation of tadpoles and the breaking of supersymmetry. Our methodology involves a detailed analysis of the low-energy effective theory of the D6-branes and the computation of instanton-generated Yukawa couplings. Our results show that a realistic model of the Standard Model can be obtained from string theory using the methods of intersecting branes and orientifolds.",1,0
"In our work entitled 'Detection of GRB 060927 at z = 5.47: Implications for the Use of Gamma-Ray Bursts as Probes of the End of the Dark Ages,' we aimed to study the characteristics of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and their potential as probes for understanding the end of the dark ages. The problem we attempted to solve was to determine if GRBs could provide insight into the formation of the first stars and galaxies, which occurred about 13 billion years ago, or if they could only illuminate the later universe at redshifts of about 5.Our key idea was to study GRB 060927 in detail since it occurred at an unprecedented redshift of 5.47. We obtained data from several telescopes and analyzed it using spectroscopy, photometry, and modeling techniques. Our results showed that GRB 060927 was an exceptionally bright and energetic burst, lasting for 10 seconds and releasing an enormous amount of energy. We also found that its host galaxy was a young dwarf galaxy, suggesting that GRBs may have contributed to the reionization of the universe in its early stages.Overall, our study highlights the potential of GRBs as probes of the early universe. Our methodology, using a combination of observational data and modeling, provides a promising approach for further investigations into the formation of the first galaxies and evolution of the universe.",1,0
"In this paper, we present the results of the study of molecular gas in the nucleus of NGC4569, a galaxy presenting a strong bar feature. This research was conducted as part of the Molecular gas in NUclei of GAlaxies (NUGA) VII project. The motivation for this work stems from the need to understand the role of gas inflow in the formation and evolution of galactic nuclei. Previous studies have suggested that gas is transported towards the nuclear region through spiral arms and bars and plays a crucial role in triggering starburst activity.Our aim was to investigate the distribution and kinematics of molecular gas in the nucleus of NGC4569. Through observations with the IRAM-30m telescope, we obtained maps of the CO(1–0) and CO(2–1) emission lines. We observed a strong concentration of molecular gas at the center of the galaxy, coincident with the nucleus. We also observed a clear velocity gradient along the major axis of the galaxy, consistent with gas inflow towards the nucleus.Our findings provide further evidence for the crucial role of bar-driven gas inflows towards the nucleus of galaxies.

"In this work, we present the first Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Fine Guidance Sensor (FGS) parallax measurements for AM CVn stars. We obtained astrometric data over five consecutive epochs with HST's FGS and used a maximum likelihood estimator to obtain parallax and proper motion measurements. Our study included the two known double-degenerate pulsating systems, HP Librae and V396 Herculis, and one non-pulsating AM CVn star, SDSS J1240-01. Our results show precise parallaxes of 3.91 ± 0.10 mas, 4.25 ± 0.09 mas, and 7.18 ± 0.60 mas, respectively, providing the first direct distance estimates to these systems.From these parallax measurements, we calculated the absolute magnitudes and inferred the masses of the components in the systems. Combining these with radial velocity observations, we derived the inclination angles and masses more accurately, enabling us to place the systems on the mass-transfer tracks. Our study shows that HP Lib and V396 Her have a high mass ratio and are close to the minimum period expected for AM CVn systems. Furthermore, SDSS J1240-01 has a mass ratio close to unity, implying that it is an intermediate polar candidate. We also discuss the implications of our results on the theoretical models of AM CVn systems and the production of gravitational waves. Our study provides an important step towards a more complete understanding of the AM CVn population and their astrophysical consequences.",1,0

WSNs have a limited lifespan due to their battery constraints, and in many cases, replacing them is not practical. Therefore, extending the lifetime of WSN is of great importance.We proposed a novel CBCT approach that combines two techniques, collaboration among sensor nodes and beamforming. The proposed approach optimizes the energy efficiency of the network by reducing the energy consumption of each node. The CBCT approach also makes the transmission more reliable and resilient against interferences and obstacles.Our experimental simulations showed that the proposed CBCT method could improve the network's lifetime by nearly 20",1,0
"In this work, we present the results of optical spectroscopy observations of a sample of Extreme High Energy Peaked BL Lac objects (EHBLs). EHBLs are a class of blazars that exhibit exceedingly high synchrotron peak frequencies, which make them particularly interesting targets for multi-wavelength studies. Our goal is to study their properties and determine their redshifts in order to understand their physical nature and the mechanisms that produce such high-energy emission. We used the 6.5m Magellan/Baade telescope located in Chile to observe 8 EHBLs, resulting in successful spectroscopic redshift measurements for 5 of them, with values ranging from z=0.07 to z=0.55. These new redshift measurements can help constrain models of EHBLs' formation and evolution. Furthermore, we confirm previous reports of the presence of broad emission lines in EHBLs, suggesting the presence of an accretion disk.

"In this work, we investigate the subpulse modulation (SPM) properties of pulsars at 92 cm and the frequency dependence of SPM. The SPM phenomenon refers to the time-varying features present in the pulsar emission pattern, which are thought to arise due to instabilities in the magnetosphere surrounding the pulsar. In particular, we focus on the frequency dependence of SPM, which is currently not well-understood.Our work attempts to shed light on this problem by utilizing new data obtained from the giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) at a frequency of 327 MHz. We analyze the data using a number of statistical techniques to quantify the SPM properties of 11 pulsars. Our analysis reveals that the properties of SPM are not only pulsar-specific but also show strong dependence on observing frequency. We find evidence of a decrease in SPM period with increasing observing frequency for at least one pulsar.Our results have important implications for understanding the underlying physics behind SPM. Furthermore, they demonstrate the need for further observations at different frequencies to fully grasp the frequency dependence of SPM. Such investigations could provide vital clues to the physical mechanisms behind radio emission from pulsars, which remain poorly understood.",1,0
"In this work, our aim was to investigate the potential of using antiproliferative MCR peptides to block the physical interaction of insulin with the retinoblastoma protein (RB) in human lung cancer cells. The issue we sought to address was the observation that insulin appears to play a role in modulating the activity of RB, which is a critical protein involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression. With this in mind, we hypothesized that disrupting the interaction between insulin and RB may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of lung cancer.To test our hypothesis, we utilized a combination of cell-based assays and molecular modeling. Our results demonstrate that the MCR peptides effectively block the interaction between insulin and RB in lung cancer cells, leading to a reduction in cell proliferation and an increase in cell death. Importantly, we also found that the peptides did not have any significant effect on normal lung cells.Overall, our study provides evidence that blocking the physical interaction between insulin and RB using MCR peptides may be a promising strategy for the treatment of lung cancer.

"We present a study on the kinematic evolution of strong MgII absorbers and their relationship with galaxy evolution. Strong MgII absorbers are a class of quasar absorption lines that arise from dense gas clouds, and are considered a useful probe of the interstellar medium (ISM) and circumgalactic medium (CGM) of galaxies at moderate redshifts. Our work aims to address the question of whether strong MgII absorbers arise from outflows or inflows.We perform a detailed analysis of the kinematic properties of 248 strong MgII absorbers at z0.5 - 1.5 using high-resolution spectroscopic data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find that strong MgII absorbers are not randomly distributed in velocity space, but instead exhibit ordered kinematic patterns that vary with redshift. Our results suggest that at higher redshifts, strong MgII absorbers tend to arise from outflows, while at lower redshifts they preferentially trace inflows toward galaxies. We investigate possible correlations between MgII absorption and galaxy properties, such as star formation rate, metallicity, and environment.Our work provides new insights into the kinematic properties and evolution of the CGM and ISM of galaxies over cosmic time. We employ various statistical methods, including clustering and principal component analysis, to extract the key kinematic features of MgII absorbers. Our findings support the idea that MgII absorbers arise from a diverse range of physical processes, including galactic winds, accretion, and merger events. Our study lays the foundation for future investigations of the link between MgII absorption and galaxy evolution, which will require larger and more comprehensive datasets.",1,0
"In this paper, we present a study on Flavour-Dependent Type II Leptogenesis. The main idea behind our work is that the observed baryon asymmetry in the Universe can be explained if the lepton number violation occurs through the decay of heavy Majorana neutrinos. In this model, the decay of these neutrinos generates a lepton asymmetry which is partially converted into a baryon asymmetry through sphaleron processes. The aim of this work is to investigate how the flavour structure of the heavy Majorana neutrino Yukawa couplings affects the generated lepton asymmetry.We develop a novel formalism that allows us to analytically calculate the lepton asymmetry in a generic flavour basis. We show that the resulting baryon asymmetry can be significantly enhanced or suppressed, depending on the Yukawa couplings' flavour structure. Additionally, we perform numerical studies of a specific model based on the SO(10) grand unified theory. In this model, the Yukawa couplings come from a single 10-plet Higgs field. We find that a flavour-dependent type II leptogenesis can explain the observed baryon asymmetry in this model.Our motivation for this work comes from the fact that the observed baryon asymmetry in the Universe is one of the most significant puzzles of modern cosmology. Therefore, understanding the origin of this asymmetry is of great importance. Our results provide new insight into the role of neutrino Yukawa couplings in the generation of the baryon asymmetry and open up new avenues for future research in this field.",1,0
"We present a comparison between anomalous 6-cm formaldehyde (H_2CO) absorption and CO(1-0) emission in the L1204/S140 region. The motivation behind this study is to investigate the relationship between molecular gas and dense cloud cores in this region, which is undergoing active star formation. Key methodology involved analyzing archival radio data from the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) and the Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory (FCRAO). We identified six H_2CO absorption features and found that the H_2CO absorption profiles and CO(1-0) emission have different shapes, peak velocities, and velocity dispersions. Our results suggest that the anomalous H_2CO absorption may be tracing different physical conditions compared to CO(1-0) emission, such as smaller dense cores associated with embedded protostars. This is supported by previous observations of compact H_2CO emission in other star-forming regions. Our findings highlight the importance of multi-wavelength studies to better understand the complex interplay between gas dynamics and star formation. Further studies are necessary to confirm these results and investigate the properties of the dense cores associated with the anomalous H_2CO absorption.",1,0
"In this work, we explore the connection between information, information processing and gravity. Our investigation is motivated by a fundamental question: Can information be related to gravity? To address this question, we utilize a theoretical framework that allows us to study the perturbative quantum effects of gravity in the presence of information fields. Specifically, we model the interaction of gravitons with quantum bits (qubits) and show how the interaction leads to non-local entanglement between qubits.Our key finding is that the presence of information has a profound impact on the behavior of gravitons and, consequently, on the dynamics of gravity. We demonstrate that information-carrying qubits modify the gravitational potential, causing deviations from classical Newtonian gravity. Moreover, we show that it is possible to manipulate the gravitational force using carefully designed information processing schemes.Our work shines light on the deep connection between information, information processing and the nature of gravity. It opens up new avenues for exploring the role of information in physical theory and for developing new technologies that leverage the quantum properties of information to control and manipulate the gravitational force.",1,0
"In our work titled 'Stellar Evolution in NGC 6791: Mass Loss on the Red Giant Branch and the Formation of Low Mass White Dwarfs,' we investigated the mass loss of stars on the red giant branch (RGB) and the formation of low mass white dwarfs (WDs) in NGC 6791. This open cluster is ideal for studying stellar evolution due to its advanced age of8 Gyr and high metallicity.We characterized the mass loss rates of 18 RGB stars in NGC 6791 through spectral analysis of molecular bands. We found that the mass loss rates were significantly higher than those predicted by theoretical models. Additionally, we identified eight low mass white dwarfs (WDs) in the cluster. Based on our analysis, we suggest that these WDs were formed through direct accretion of RGB winds onto low mass companion stars. This contradicts previous studies that suggested mass transfer in binary systems as the primary mechanism for the formation of low mass WDs.Our findings have important implications for our understanding of stellar evolution and the formation of WDs in open clusters. Our methodology, which combined spectroscopic analysis and theoretical modeling, can be applied to other clusters to improve our understanding of mass loss and WD formation mechanisms.",1,0
"In this research, we investigate the predictability of the solar cycle using mean-field models, a popular tool in the field of solar physics. Our motivation for this investigation is to improve our understanding of the solar cycle and to make accurate predictions of its activity. To achieve this goal, we first propose a new approach that combines mean-field models with the Bayesian framework. This method allows the incorporation of new observations over time and provides us with a constantly updated estimate of the solar activity levels. We then apply this approach to the observed solar cycle data and compare our predictions with the actual observations. Our analysis shows that our new method outperforms the traditional mean-field models and provides more accurate predictions of the solar cycle. Furthermore, we use our approach to make predictions for the next solar cycle, which is expected to peak around 2025. Our results suggest that the activity levels during the next solar cycle will be similar to the current cycle, with a peak in activity around 2025. Our findings have important implications for predicting the effects of solar activity on Earth's climate and for forecasting space weather events.",1,0
"In our work, we explore the top quark production in association with nonstandard, strongly interacting spin one particles at the Tevatron and LHC. The motivation for our research stems from the need to explain the unusual events observed in the experiments at these facilities. These events suggest the presence of new physics beyond the standard model.The problem we aim to solve is to identify the possible scenarios of new physics responsible for these unusual events. We focus on the top quark production because of its high sensitivity to new physics. We study the top quark pair production in association with a spin one particle in the effective field theory framework. We consider the scenarios where the spin one particle is a vector boson that couples with the top quark through the axial or the vector current.Our methodology involves a detailed analysis of the theoretical and experimental constraints on the model parameters.

"In this study, we investigate the dynamic interactions between gamma-ray burst (GRB) blast waves and wind-shaped circumburst media. GRBs are the most powerful explosions in the universe that release immense amounts of energy in a short span of time. They occur when a massive star collapses or two neutron stars merge. The blast wave produced during a GRB can rapidly generate a shock wave that interacts with the surrounding circumburst medium. The complex structure and dynamics of the medium pose challenges in understanding the morphology and physical properties of the shock wave. Therefore, we aim to explore the fundamental mechanisms of shock wave propagation and evolution through a wind-shaped circumburst medium.The motivation for our research is to develop a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms governing the physical properties of the GRB blast wave. We aim to provide insights into processes such as turbulence, instabilities, and shocks that occur during the interaction of the blast wave with the surrounding medium. Our study offers a unique approach to modeling and simulating the evolution of GRB blast waves and their interaction with the circumburst medium.To achieve our objectives, we employ a numerical simulation technique that solves the equations governing the dynamics of the circumburst medium and the blast wave simultaneously. The numerical simulations are carried out using the adaptive mesh refinement technique. Our findings show that the dynamic properties of the medium play a crucial role in controlling the morphology and evolution of the blast wave. In conclusion, our research provides new insights into the physics of GRB blast waves and can lead to improved models of these explosive events in the universe.",1,0
"In this work, we sought to constrain the geometry of the neutron star RX J1856.5-3754, a crucial step to understand the physics of these extreme objects. Using data from the XMM-Newton space telescope, we applied a novel spectral model that accounts for the effects of the interstellar medium to the X-ray spectrum of the neutron star. This allowed us to derive a more accurate estimate of the hydrogen column density towards the object and thus, better estimate its distance. We also used data from the Hubble Space Telescope to search for a possible optical counterpart, which would provide additional constraints on the distance and the system's geometry.Our main result is the first measurement of the distance to RX J1856.5-3754 with an accuracy of 6",1,0
"In this study, we investigate the dynamic response of Ag monolayers adsorbed on Au(100) under an oscillatory change of the chemical potential using Monte Carlo simulation. We aim to understand the behavior of Ag atoms on Au(100) in terms of their mobility and stability. Monte Carlo simulation is a powerful tool for studying the dynamic behavior of atoms on surfaces. The simulation was carried out by using Metropolis Monte Carlo (MMC) algorithm, which enables us to sample the probability distribution of the system.Our results indicate that the Ag atoms on Au(100) show unique dynamic behavior in response to oscillatory change of the chemical potential. We found that the presence of Au atoms in the vicinity of Ag atoms increases their mobility, and Ag atoms exhibit a tendency to aggregate under a positive chemical potential while their dispersion is promoted under a negative chemical potential. This study provides insights into the dynamic behavior of adsorbed monolayers under oscillatory conditions, which is important in understanding the behavior of surfaces in technological applications.The problem we attempt to solve in this study is to gain a deeper understanding of the dynamic behavior of Ag monolayers on Au(100) under oscillatory change of chemical potential.

"In this paper, we provide a critical review of the statistical analysis presented in 'A new experimental limit for the stability of the electron' by H.V. Klapdor-Kleingrothaus, I.V. Krivosheina, and I.V. Titkova. The authors aim to test the hypothesis that the electron, a fundamental particle in physics, is stable over long periods of time. The methodology used involves conducting an experiment to search for evidence of electron decay and performing a statistical analysis of the collected data.Our analysis highlights potential issues with the methodology used in the study, including the lack of a clear statistical model and the failure to account for multiple testing. Additionally, we note that the study's results are highly dependent on the choice of prior probability distributions, which may introduce bias. We suggest that future studies investigating the stability of the electron should address these issues to ensure the reliability of their results.Overall, this work attempts to contribute to the rigorous evaluation of experimental findings in physics research. By identifying potential pitfalls in statistical analysis, we hope to encourage researchers to carefully consider their methods and interpretations to advance our understanding of the fundamental laws of nature.",1,0
"In this paper, we present the measurement of the top-quark mass using missing E_T+jets events with secondary vertex b-tagging at the CDF II particle collider. The top-quark is the heaviest known elementary particle and its mass is a fundamental parameter in the Standard Model of particle physics. Precise measurement of the top-quark mass is crucial to test the consistency of the Standard Model and to search for new physics beyond it.Our goal was to measure the top-quark mass using a novel method consisting of selecting events that have missing transverse energy (MET) and at least one jet that contains a secondary vertex identified as a b-jet. We analyzed data collected in proton-antiproton collisions at √(s) = 1.96 TeV by the CDF II detector, located at the Fermilab Tevatron accelerator.The key idea of our analysis was to construct a template of the top-quark mass distribution by fitting the MET distribution in data and comparing it to the prediction from simulation. We used a Bayesian approach to extract the top-quark mass and its uncertainty. Our method has the advantage of being less sensitive to the jet energy scale and resolution uncertainties, compared to traditional top-quark mass measurements.Our result for the top-quark mass is 172.8 ± 2.2 (stat.)± 1.5 (syst.) GeV/c^2, which is one of the most precise measurements to date. This measurement contributes to the global effort to improve the knowledge of the top-quark mass and to search for new physics phenomena.",1,0
"In this work, we investigate the behaviour of a brane moving in a bulk spacetime with the cosmological constant. Specifically, we consider a single (1 + 1)-dimensional timelike brane, which undergoes Lorentzian signature change as it moves through the bulk spacetime. Lorentzian signature change in the brane worldvolume can be interpreted as a phase transition in the effective theory describing the motion of the brane. In our study, we derive the boundary conditions satisfied by the brane worldvolume and compute the Hamiltonian, which describes the dynamics of the brane. We also investigate the existence and properties of special solutions, namely, bouncing branes and static branes. Moreover, we analyze the properties of the trajectory and the phase diagram of the brane in the bulk spacetime. Our results demonstrate that the dynamics of the brane is significantly modified by the introduction of the signature change and provides a richer set of solutions beyond the conventional Dirac-Born-Infeld equations. The motivation for our work comes from the need to explore a larger class of solutions in the brane worldvolume theory that may be relevant for cosmological and high energy physics.",1,0
"In this work, we present the results of our multicolor observations of the afterglow of the short/hard GRB 050724. Our motivation for this research is to better understand the physical mechanisms responsible for the prompt emission and afterglow of short/hard gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and their associated host environments. Short/hard GRBs are brief, intense bursts of gamma-ray radiation with durations of less than two seconds. Unlike long-duration GRBs, they are not associated with supernova explosions and are believed to be produced by mergers of compact objects such as neutron stars or black holes.Our observations were carried out using the 2.2-m telescope at Calar Alto Observatory in Spain and the 8.2-m Subaru Telescope in Hawaii. We obtained multicolor photometric data over several epochs spanning a few hours to several days following the GRB. We used these data to construct the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the afterglow, which allowed us to derive its physical properties such as the electron energy distribution and the density of the surrounding medium.Our analysis showed that the afterglow of GRB 050724 had a steep spectral slope, indicating that the electron energy distribution was particularly steep. This is in contrast to what is typically observed for long-duration GRBs. Our observations also revealed a possible break in the afterglow light curve, which could be due to either a jet break or the injection of fresh energy into the blast wave. Our study provides valuable insights into the physics of short/hard GRBs and their associated host environments.",1,0

"We present an analysis of the outer jet X-ray and radio emission in R Aquarii from 1999.8 to 2004.0 using Chandra X-ray Observatory and Multi-Element Radio-Linked Interferometer Network (MERLIN) data. R Aquarii is a symbiotic star system consisting of a red giant and a white dwarf in a binary system. It is known for its extended bipolar jet that manifests in both X-ray and radio frequencies. Our work aims to study the temporal variability of the outer jet emission over five years and understand the interplay between different physical mechanisms responsible for the observed emission.The motivation for this research is to gain insights into the physical processes involved in the formation and evolution of the R Aquarii jet and study the effects of the interaction between the jet and ambient medium. We use spectral and imaging analyses to characterize the jet emission and investigate the effects of shocks and synchrotron radiation in the jet. The methodology adopted involves analyzing X-ray and radio light curves, spectra, images, and comparing the results with state-of-the-art models.Our study shows a complex temporal behavior of the outer jet emission that is attributed to the interaction between the jet and the surrounding medium. The spectral analysis indicates that the jet is powered by a combination of thermal and non-thermal mechanisms, and synchrotron radiation is a dominant contributor to the radio emission. Further, the imaging analysis reveals a limb-brightened outer jet morphology with evidence of shocks and precessional motion. Overall, our work provides valuable insights into the physics of the jet in R Aquarii and highlights the importance of multiwavelength studies to understand the nature of astrophysical jets.",1,0
"In this study, we present the results of our analysis of the near-infrared spectra of the black hole X-ray binary, A0620-00. Black hole X-ray binaries provide an ideal environment to study the strong gravitational effects of black holes on their companion star. They also provide crucial insights into the formation and evolution of binary systems. The near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum is particularly useful in these studies because it allows us to probe the innermost regions of the system, where the black hole exerts the strongest gravitational forces.Our goal was to analyze the near-infrared spectra of A0620-00 and decipher the properties of the system. Using high-resolution spectra obtained from the Gemini Near-Infrared Spectrograph (GNIRS), we were able to extract several important features of the system. We identified the presence of a hot accretion disk around the black hole, which emits intense near-infrared radiation. We also detected the signature of the companion star, a low-mass red dwarf, which is orbiting the black hole every 7.75 hours.Our findings provide important insights into the physics of black hole X-ray binaries and their evolution. Our study also highlights the usefulness of near-infrared observations in studying these systems. Further studies in this field will undoubtedly shed more light on the mysteries of black holes and their interactions with their surroundings.",1,0
"In this work, we investigate the scaling relations of compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence using high-resolution numerical simulations. Turbulence is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature and plays a vital role in astrophysical systems such as the interstellar medium, accretion disks, and the solar wind. Our main objective is to elucidate the scaling properties of compressible MHD turbulence and identify the physical mechanisms that govern its dynamics.We use a pseudospectral method to solve the compressible MHD equations in a periodic box with isothermal conditions. We employ a range of magnetic field strengths and sonic Mach numbers to study the effects of varying parameters on the scaling relations. We find that the compressible modes of turbulence exhibit different scaling properties compared to incompressible turbulence. Moreover, the anisotropy of the turbulence is found to be dependent on the strength of the magnetic field.Our research provides insights into the fundamental nature of compressible MHD turbulence and its dependencies on the underlying physics.

"In this study, we investigate Ly-alpha Emission-Line Galaxies (LAEs) at redshift z = 3.1 in the Extended Chandra Deep Field South (ECDFS) using deep spectroscopic observations with VIMOS on the Very Large Telescope. One of the key motivations for this research is to explore the properties of LAEs at high redshifts. LAEs are among the most numerous galaxies during the epoch of reionization, and studying them can reveal important information about the early universe. Through our analysis, we aim to understand the nature, properties, and evolution of these galaxies.We use a spectral stacking method to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of our observations and to study the average properties of a large sample of LAEs. Our results show that LAEs have strong Ly-alpha emission, consistent with previous observations. We find that the equivalent width of the Ly-alpha line in our sample is significantly higher than in previous studies, which suggests that these LAEs are highly ionized. Moreover, our analysis shows evidence of significant Ly-alpha escape fraction, which indicates that these galaxies could be important sources for reionization.In conclusion, our study provides valuable insights into the properties of LAEs at high redshifts and their potential role in reionization. Our method can be extended to larger samples in the future, opening up opportunities for a deeper understanding of the early universe.",1,0
"In this study, we present new observations and analyses of the light curves and colours of the faint irregular satellites of Uranus: Sycorax, Prospero, Stephano, Setebos, and Trinculo. These moons are interesting objects to study due to their irregular orbits and suspected captured origin. However, their faintness and low surface albedo make them challenging targets for observation and analysis.The motivation for this research is to better understand the physical characteristics of these small Uranian moons and to study their formation and evolution. Our work attempts to solve the problem of the lack of comprehensive data on these objects and to provide a more detailed understanding of their rotational properties and surface heterogeneity.Our key idea is to use multi-filter observations of the moons’ brightness variability to study their rotational properties and surface compositions.

"In this work, we present the Spitzer-IRAC GLIMPSE study of high mass protostellar objects. The motivation of this research is to understand the physical processes involved in the formation and early evolution of high mass stars. Our key idea is to use a combination of infrared point sources and nebulae observations to identify and categorize protostellar objects with different evolutionary stages. We also aim to derive their physical properties, such as temperature, luminosity, and mass, using spectral energy distribution modeling.To carry out this investigation, we analyzed the Spitzer-IRAC data from the Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire (GLIMPSE) and identified 1191 candidate high mass protostellar objects, which we classified into three categories: high luminosity, intermediate luminosity, and low luminosity sources. Moreover, we found that a significant fraction of these objects present extended emission in the form of infrared nebulae, indicating the presence of outflows and ionized gas in their vicinity. We also found a correlation between the presence of these nebulae and certain evolutionary stages of protostellar objects.Finally, we compared our results with previous works in the field and discussed the implications of the observed correlations for the formation and early evolution of high mass stars.

"Our study focuses on the anticenter open cluster NGC 1883 and aims to investigate its radial velocity and metallicity. We utilized multi-object spectroscopy for 45 targets in the cluster region using the 6.5-m telescope at Xinglong Station, NAOC. Radial velocities of cluster members were obtained by cross-correlating with template stars, highlighting the high membership probability of stars with consistent radial velocities.

"In our research, we investigate the Hopf algebra structure of the character rings of classical groups. The motivation for this study is twofold. First, these character rings are fundamental objects in representation theory and have been studied extensively in the past. Second, Hopf algebras provide a powerful framework for studying algebraic structures that arise in numerous branches of mathematics, including topology, algebraic geometry, and mathematical physics.We establish the Hopf algebra structure on the character ring of the special orthogonal group over a field of arbitrary characteristic. This is accomplished by constructing the Hopf algebra structure on the group algebra of the same group and then using a technique known as Frobenius reciprocity to transfer the structure to the character ring. This result is significant since it provides a unified framework for understanding the algebraic structure of a wide class of representation rings.Additionally, we explore the relationship between the Hopf algebra structure of the character ring and certain geometric and combinatorial objects associated with the classical groups. Our results suggest that these objects may be intimately related and provide a new avenue for exploring the algebraic structure of the character ring.Ultimately, our work aims to contribute to the ongoing study of character rings and Hopf algebras by providing new insights and techniques for understanding these fundamental objects in representation theory.",1,0
"We present a study of the non-Markovian dynamics of entanglement between two continuous variable systems immersed in independent thermal baths. Using the quantum state diffusion method, we derive the master equation describing the evolution of the composite system. In contrast to the Markovian case, where entanglement decays monotonically to zero, we show that non-Markovianity leads to the revival of entanglement due to the exchange of energy between the quantum systems and their back-action on the baths. We analyze the interplay between the entanglement dynamics and the coherences of the reduced density matrices of the quantum systems. We show that the initial correlations and the temperature of the environment have a strong impact on the behavior of the entanglement and the coherence of the reduced states. Our findings reveal the importance of accounting for non-Markovian effects in the dynamics of entanglement in quantum systems coupled to thermal environments. This work sheds light on the role of memory effects in the manipulation of quantum information, opening up new avenues for the design of quantum control protocols for quantum communication and computation.",1,0
"In our academic work, we addressed the 1874 controversy between Camille Jordan and Leopold Kronecker to better understand the debates surrounding the foundations of mathematics and the emergence of abstract algebra as a discipline. The motivation behind this research was to investigate the views and arguments presented by both mathematicians and to highlight the implications of such a controversy for the development of mathematical thought.We used a historical and analytical methodology to examine the different aspects of the controversy. Our research focused on understanding the arguments presented by Jordan and Kronecker and how they related to the emerging field of abstract algebra. We analyzed the main ideas and concepts presented by both mathematicians, emphasizing the role that mathematical abstractions played in their reasoning.Through our study, we discovered that the controversy between Jordan and Kronecker revealed significant differences in their views on mathematical abstraction and the nature of mathematical entities. The debate centered on Kronecker's objections to Jordan's use of abstract algebraic structures to solve problems in number theory. Jordan saw abstraction as essential for progress in mathematics, while Kronecker believed that it would lead to confusion and abstraction from physical reality.Our research provides a deeper understanding of the controversy and its impact on the development of abstract algebra.

"In our research, we investigate the sensitivity of solar off-limb line profiles to electron density stratification and the velocity distribution anisotropy. The motivation behind our work is to understand the influence of the solar atmosphere's physical properties on spectral line profiles. To achieve this, we employed a novel methodology that combines numerical simulations and observational data.First, we simulated the solar atmosphere using the radiative transfer code RH, implementing a 1D model with 16 layers. Next, we constructed line profiles using the NEMO code, which accounts for the solar limb darkening and instrumental broadening effects. We then compared the line profiles from our simulations to those observed with the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). We varied the electron density stratification and velocity distribution anisotropy parameters, and we observed how they impact the line profiles.Our work addresses a crucial problem in solar physics: the need to understand the mechanisms that shape the solar atmosphere's spectral lines.

"In this research, we investigate the weak charge disproportion and leading mechanisms in half-doped manganites. The charge ordering phenomenon exhibited by these materials is of great importance, since it is closely related to their magnetic and transport properties. In particular, the weak charge disproportion effect is a crucial aspect to understand, since it implies a coexistence of charge-ordered and disordered regions within the same material.We employ a combined theoretical and experimental approach, using x-ray and neutron diffraction techniques, as well as density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The main motivation for this work is to shed light on the nature of the weak charge ordering and its relation to the observed magnetic and transport properties in half-doped manganites. Moreover, we aim to identify the leading mechanisms responsible for this effect, which have been subject of debate in the literature.Our results show that the weak charge disproportion is a long-range effect, with a characteristic wavevector Q = (0.5, 0.5, 0.5). Furthermore, we find that the lattice distortion plays an important role in stabilizing the charge-ordered state. Finally, we propose a model based on the competition between the double-exchange and superexchange interactions to explain the observed charge ordering behavior.

"In this paper, we investigate the interplay between intertwining operators and triangular actions of Lie algebras. Our motivation stems from the need to understand the structure of certain important classes of Lie algebras, including Kac-Moody algebras, vertex operator algebras, and affine Lie algebras. We use a combinatorial approach based on Kazhdan-Lusztig theory to obtain a formula for the product of intertwining operators associated to two triangular actions. Our key idea is to use a triangular decomposition of the Lie algebra to reduce the problem to a simpler case involving only two-step nilpotent subalgebras. The resulting formula is a natural generalization of a previously known formula for the case of regular semisimple elements. Our methodology involves careful manipulation of combinatorial data and an understanding of the representation theory of triangular subalgebras. As a result of our work, we obtain a new expression for certain central elements in the universal enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra, which has potential applications in both pure mathematics and physics.

"In this study, we introduce a novel, very massive modular Liquid Argon Imaging Chamber (LArTPC) designed to detect low energy off-axis neutrinos from the CNGS beam, known as Project MODULAr. The motivation for this research is to investigate the properties of neutrinos and their oscillations, which can provide insights into the fundamental nature of matter and the Universe. Additionally, detecting low energy neutrinos from off-axis provides an opportunity to measure the neutrino-nucleus cross-section and further understand the neutrino interaction mechanisms.The key idea of Project MODULAr is to break down the LArTPC into smaller modular units for easy assembly and maintenance. The modules have a size of 3×6×6 m^3, and they are constructed with a steel frame and filled with liquid argon. Each module is equipped with an array of photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) to detect scintillation light from passing neutrinos. The data obtained from the PMTs is then analyzed to identify neutrino signals.Preliminary results from the first 25-tonne module of Project MODULAr demonstrate the capability of the detector to distinguish signal from background events. The efficiency in selecting true neutrino interactions is high, and the background events are significantly lower than the expected rate. The modular design is also favorable for easy maintenance and scalability, with the potential to construct a LArTPC that can obtain precise measurements of neutrino properties with higher statistical significance.In conclusion, Project MODULAr presents a promising prospect for future neutrino hunting experiments with the potential to make breakthroughs in understanding the fundamental nature of the Universe.",1,0
"In this study, we present a detailed analysis of the properties of the flaming, bright galaxies along the filaments of A2744. We utilized imaging and spectroscopic data obtained from the Hubble Space Telescope and the Keck Observatory. Our results show that the galaxies along the filaments possess properties that are distinct from those of galaxies in the surrounding field. We found that these galaxies exhibit strong emission lines and high star-formation rates, as well as blue colors and young stellar populations. Additionally, we observed that the filaments contain a high fraction of elliptical galaxies, indicating that the environment has a strong impact on galaxy morphology.The motivation for this research stems from the desire to understand the role of large-scale structures in galaxy evolution. A2744 is a massive galaxy cluster with an intricate network of filaments that act as pathways for galaxy growth. Hence, studying the properties of galaxies along the filaments can provide insights into the physical processes that shape the assembly of galaxies. Our methodology involved quantifying various properties of the galaxies, such as their star-formation rates, colors, and morphologies, and comparing them to those of galaxies in the field. Our findings provide evidence for the importance of environment in shaping galaxy properties and evolution, and shed light on the physical mechanisms that drive galaxy growth and evolution in clusters.",1,0
"In this paper, we present a novel technique for enhancing the accuracy and precision of percutaneous renal access. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL) is a common procedure used to remove kidney stones. It involves puncturing the kidney through the skin and creating a tract to access the calculus. Inaccurate placement of the accessing needle can result in complications such as bleeding, injury to adjacent structures, or failed entry into the collecting system.The motivation for this research is to improve the safety and success rates of PNL procedures. We propose a method of virtual projection of the ultrasound puncture tract onto fluoroscopic images, using a software tool that we have developed for this purpose. Our algorithm uses a combination of 3D reconstruction and projection techniques to provide a representation of the exact trajectory of the puncture needle onto the X-ray images.Our study demonstrates the feasibility and accuracy of our approach. The virtual projection provides a real-time reference for the clinician to guide the needle towards the puncture site, minimizing the risk of injury to nearby structures and ensuring optimal placement. This method could improve the safety and efficacy of PNL procedures, and we envision it being used in future clinical applications as a standard procedure for renal access.",1,0
"In our work titled 'Dirichlet or Potts?', we explore the problem of image segmentation, which involves partitioning an image into several distinct regions. This is a fundamental problem in computer vision and has significant applications in medical imaging, object recognition, and autonomous driving systems. The work attempts to address the question of which model, Dirichlet or Potts, is better suited for image segmentation tasks.We first introduce the Dirichlet model, which assumes that the image regions have independent Gaussian distributions. We then present the Potts model, which models neighboring regions as a group with a shared distribution. We compared the performance of these two models on the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset, consisting of natural, real-world images. Our analysis reveals that the Potts model outperforms the Dirichlet model in most cases in terms of the segmentation accuracy.The key idea behind our work is to evaluate the effectiveness of two widely-used models for image segmentation. Our methodology involves training both models on a set of images and comparing their performance in terms of their ability to accurately segment images. We believe that our results have significant implications for researchers and practitioners in the field of computer vision, who can use these findings to improve their segmentation algorithms.In summary, our work 'Dirichlet or Potts?' investigates the problem of image segmentation, with the aim of comparing the performance of two popular models. Our results demonstrate that the Potts model outperforms the Dirichlet model, and we anticipate that this work will enable more accurate and efficient segmentation of real-world images in future applications.",1,0
"We present a study on two energy release processes for coronal mass ejections (CMEs): the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) catastrophe and magnetic reconnection. Our research is motivated by the importance of understanding the complex dynamics of CMEs, which can have a significant impact on the Earth's space environment. We investigate these two energy release processes by simulating a CME with a 3D numerical MHD model.Our results show that the MHD catastrophe plays a significant role in the initial phase of the CME, during which the magnetic field rapidly expands and accelerates, leading to the ejection of plasma into interplanetary space. On the other hand, magnetic reconnection is responsible for the energy release in the later stages of the CME, where it can cause the magnetic field to relax and form a flux rope structure. We also find that the strength and orientation of the magnetic field play a crucial role in determining which energy release process dominates during a CME event.Our study contributes to the ongoing efforts to improve our understanding of CMEs and their potential impact on our planet. By identifying the key factors that drive the two energy release processes, we provide valuable insights for future space weather forecasting. Our methodology utilizes advanced MHD numerical simulations and is based on a rigorous treatment of the underlying physical processes, which enables us to obtain accurate results and quantifiable predictions.",1,0
"In this work, we present a methodology for generating a detailed simulation of a radio telescope using both ray-tracing and physical-optics analysis. Our goal is to investigate the aperture efficiency of the telescope's system, which represents a crucial parameter for assessing its overall performance. Using this approach, we simulate both the geometrical configuration of the telescope and the electromagnetic behavior of the system.Our results show that the aperture efficiency of the telescope is significantly affected by various factors, including the alignment accuracy of the reflector, the size and shape of the aperture, and the accuracy of the wavefront sensor. In particular, we found that the alignment of the reflector plays a significant role in the overall performance of the telescope. We also investigated the impact of different shapes of the aperture on the aperture efficiency.Our work contributes to the improvement of radio telescopes by providing insight into the factors that may degrade their performance. Moreover, our approach may be extended to assess the aperture efficiency of other systems involving electromagnetic waves.",1,0
"In this work, we investigate the energy dependence of the jet transport parameter and parton saturation in quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Jets, collimated sprays of particles produced in high-energy collisions, are crucial probes for studying QGP properties. Their energy loss while passing through the QGP can be described by a transport parameter, which characterizes the QGP's ability to interact with the jet. Additionally, saturation effects due to high parton densities in the QGP are expected to occur at high energies.We use a hybrid approach combining perturbative QCD calculations with a numerical simulation of the QGP fluid dynamics to study these phenomena. Our results show that the transport parameter exhibits a power-law growth with energy, indicating that the QGP becomes more opaque to jets at higher energies. Moreover, we find evidence of parton saturation effects that emerge at energy densities of a few GeV/fm^3. These findings provide insights into the QGP's transport properties and its saturation regime, which are relevant for understanding the formation and evolution of heavy-ion collisions.The motivation for this research stems from the need to improve our understanding of the QGP's non-perturbative properties, which have been challenging to model accurately. The hybrid approach used allows us to capture both the perturbative and non-perturbative phenomena, providing a more comprehensive description of jet-medium interactions in QGP. Overall, our study contributes to the ongoing efforts to unravel the mysteries of QGP and the strong nuclear force.",1,0
"In this study, we propose a method to detect and characterize planetary systems using transit timing. Our method involves conducting thorough analyses of transit timing variations (TTVs) induced by perturbations from multiple planetary companions, and their orbital resonances. By modeling the TTV patterns, we can obtain estimates for the planetary masses, eccentricities, and inclination angles.We applied our method to simulated data and real observations of three exoplanetary systems: Kepler-11, Kepler-9, and HD 10180. Our analysis revealed two previously unknown planets in Kepler-11, and accurately reconstructed the properties of the already known planets. Similarly, we confirmed the presence of two gas giants in Kepler-9, and estimated their properties with high precision. Our analysis of HD 10180 gave consistent results with previous studies, further validating our method.Our method is particularly useful for systems with multiple transiting planets, where traditional radial velocity measurements can be challenging or impossible. Our findings emphasize the importance of transit timing variations in exoplanetary studies, and highlight their potential for discovering and characterizing new planetary systems.Overall, our research provides valuable insight into the dynamics of planetary systems and can aid future exoplanetary studies. Our findings contribute to the ongoing efforts to identify Earth-like planets and ultimately, advance our understanding of the universe.",1,0
"In this study, we present the Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations of nineteen GHz-Peaked-Spectrum (GPS) radio sources at 1.6 GHz. GPS sources are a class of extragalactic radio sources with a spectral peak between 1 and 10 GHz. With the advent of high-resolution observations, GPS sources have become important laboratories for studying the physical conditions of radio sources.Our work attempts to shed new light on the morphological and kinematic properties of GPS quasars by using VLBI observations. We aim to understand the origin of the spectral peaks and the jet properties in these sources. Our VLBI observations were made at 15 GHz using the Global mm-VLBI Array and at 1.6 GHz using the European VLBI Network. We obtained high-resolution images and kinematic data to derive the physical parameters of the GPS sources.Our results show that the morphological structure of GPS quasars is dominated by a central core and two-sided jet emission. In some sources, we found evidence for counter-jet emission. We also found a correlation between the spectral peak frequency and the size of the GPS sources. These results provide important constraints for theoretical models of the physical processes that govern the properties of GPS quasars. Our study advances the understanding of the physical properties of GPS sources and their role in the extragalactic radio sky.",1,0
"In this study, we investigate intervening metal systems in Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) and Quasi-Stellar Objects (QSO) sight-lines, specifically focusing on the Mgii and Civ lines. We aim to understand the physical properties and distribution of these intervening systems, as they can provide valuable information about the intergalactic medium and the evolution of galaxies.Our analysis involved the examination of over 60 GRB and QSO spectra obtained from the Keck telescope. We identified several intervening metal systems and analyzed their absorption characteristics, including their column densities and Doppler parameters. We found that the incidence of metal absorption in GRB sight-lines is nearly two times higher than in QSO sight-lines, and that the equivalent widths of the Mgii and Civ lines are positively correlated. Additionally, we found that the majority of the metal systems have low ionization states and are associated with galaxies at moderate redshifts.Our research contributes to the understanding of the physical properties and distribution of intervening metal systems in GRB and QSO sight-lines. The results obtained have implications for the study of galaxy formation and evolution, as well as the structure of the intergalactic medium. The motivation for this research is driven by the desire to gain insight into the fundamental properties of the universe and the processes that shape its evolution.",1,0
"In our work, we investigate the quantum spin liquid states in the two-dimensional kagome antiferromagnets, ZnxCu4-x(OD)6Cl2. The kagome lattice is a highly debated system in condensed matter physics, which is gaining prominence due to its interesting and complex behavior. Kagome antiferromagnets have been previously shown to possess strong frustration, leading to various exotic states of matter. Our aim is to study the quantum spin liquid behavior in these materials as we believe that this can help us gain a better understanding of the underlying physics of the system.Our research has been motivated by the fact that despite extensive studies on kagome antiferromagnets, the nature of the ground state and the possible existence of a quantum spin liquid state remain elusive. We utilized neutron scattering measurements and performed extensive theoretical analysis, which helped us to unveil various features of these materials' quantum behavior. We discovered that we had observed the most conclusive evidence of a quantum spin liquid in ZnxCu4-x(OD)6Cl2 compounds to date.Our results show that there is a profound and exciting relationship between the magnetic properties and structural changes in these materials. This research marks a significant step towards further understanding quantum spin liquids and their associated behavior in highly complex systems. The insights offered by our work are likely to play a vital role in the development of future spin-based technologies, with possible applications in quantum computing.",1,0
"In this study, we aimed to explore the mass of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using millimeter (mm) dust continuum emission. Our understanding of GMCs and their role in the evolution of galaxies is limited by uncertainty in their masses, which are difficult to determine. Our work used data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to study 7 GMCs in the SMC. We found that the traditional methods used to estimate the mass of GMCs were unreliable due to the complex morphology of the clouds and the difficulty in distinguishing diffuse from dense regions. By analyzing the mm dust continuum emission, we were able to obtain a more accurate estimate of the GMCs' mass and structure. Our results revealed that the total mass of the 7 GMCs was 1.42 × 10^5 solar masses, which is higher than previous estimates. Our study provides a more accurate understanding of GMCs in the SMC, which will influence future research on the evolution of galaxies and star formation. The key idea behind this work is to use a novel approach to accurately measure the mass of GMCs, which is essential for our understanding of the evolution of these structures. Our methodology involved high-resolution imaging using the ALMA and careful analysis of the mm dust continuum emission.",1,0
"In this study, we investigate the mid-infrared fine structure line ratios in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) observed with Spitzer IRS and examine the evidence for extinction by the torus. The torus is a hypothesized dusty structure surrounding the central engine of an AGN. Its line-of-sight obscuration can affect the observed properties of AGNs, including their mid-infrared line ratios, which are considered to be powerful diagnostics of their physical conditions. We have analyzed a sample of 92 AGNs spanning a range of luminosities and spectral types and find that their mid-infrared fine structure line ratios are consistent with photoionization models, but they also show a dependence on AGN luminosity. Furthermore, we observe a significant correlation between the ionic line ratios and the silicate absorption depth, which suggests the presence of dusty material along the line-of-sight. We interpret this observation as evidence for the torus as the responsible structure. Our results suggest that extinction by the torus is a crucial factor that must be taken into account in the interpretation of AGN spectra. The methodology we have employed involves modeling the AGN spectra with photoionization models and analyzing the correlations between the mid-infrared line ratios and the silicate absorption depth.",1,0
"In this study, we investigate the effects of crystal grinding on the superconducting transitions of PrOs_4Sb_12. The motivation for this research stems from the fact that this material exhibits two distinct superconducting transitions, labelled as α and β transitions. Previous studies have suggested that these transitions may be related to different electronic degrees of freedom. Here, we aim to explore this idea by studying the impact of grinding on the material's superconducting behavior.Our results show that the α and β transitions can indeed be separated by crystal grinding. Specifically, we find that grinding the sample increases the strength of the β transition while decreasing the strength of the α transition. These changes are accompanied by modifications in the specific heat of the material. Our findings suggest that the two transitions in PrOs_4Sb_12 may be linked to different electronic states, which can be influenced by different crystal structures.The methodology used in this research involves synthesizing PrOs_4Sb_12 and grinding the crystals in a ball mill. Measurements of the specific heat of the samples are performed using a Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System. Our work contributes to a better understanding of the nature of the two superconducting transitions in PrOs_4Sb_12 and the potential effects of crystalline structure on electronic states.",1,0
"In this study, we report on our search for a kaonic nuclear state via ^4He(K^-, N). Our aim is to investigate the existence of such a state and its properties. Kaonic nuclear states are formed when a kaon (K^-) is captured by a nucleus, resulting in a bound state with a proton or neutron. These states are of great interest in nuclear physics because they provide insights into the strong interaction between hadrons and the nuclear force.We performed an experiment using the K1.8 beam line at the J-PARC facility in Japan. A beam of negative kaons was directed at a target consisting of helium-4 molecules. The scattered neutrons were detected using a scintillation counter array. We observed a peak in the neutron energy spectrum that could be attributed to a kaonic nuclear state. However, further analysis is required to confirm this observation.The search for kaonic nuclear states has been a topic of interest in nuclear physics for several decades. Our study contributes to this field by providing experimental evidence for a possible kaonic nuclear state in a helium-4 nucleus. The confirmation of this state's existence and its properties could provide valuable insights into the interaction between kaons and nuclei.",1,0
"In this paper, we present a comprehensive climatology of midlatitude cirrus clouds and multiple tropopauses, based on measurements from the SIRTA Observatory between 2002 and 2006. Our study focuses on understanding the complex interplay between atmospheric dynamics and cloud microphysics, with the goal of improving our ability to predict the evolution of these important climate variables.The methodology of our work entails the use of a suite of ground-based remote sensing instruments, including lidars, radiometers, and sondes, to probe the vertical structure and optical properties of the atmosphere. We analyze these data using a variety of statistical and visualization techniques, such as probability density functions (PDFs), contour plots, and scatter plots.The central problem that our work attempts to solve is the lack of detailed knowledge about the mechanisms that govern the spatial and temporal variability of cirrus clouds and multiple tropopauses, especially in the midlatitude regions. This lack of understanding is a major obstacle to accurate climate modeling and policy making, as these variables are known to have significant impacts on the radiation budget, atmospheric circulation, and surface temperature.The motivation for our research is thus twofold: first, to advance our fundamental understanding of the Earth's climate system by elucidating the key factors that control the behavior of midlatitude cirrus clouds and multiple tropopauses; and second, to provide policymakers and stakeholders with more reliable and actionable information about future climate trends and their potential impacts.",1,0
"Our work titled “Variation of the Amati Relation with the Cosmological Redshift: a Selection Effect or an Evolution Effect?” aims to investigate whether the apparent variation of the Amati relation with the cosmological redshift is due to selection or evolution effects. The Amati relation is a correlation between the peak energy and the isotropic equivalent radiated energy of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). It is a crucial tool for studying the properties, evolution, and distance measurements of the GRB population. However, recent observations of large samples of GRBs have shown a possible deviation of the Amati relation from its standard form, which is a cause of concern for the validity and robustness of the relation.Our study uses a sample of 92 GRBs with measured redshifts and spectral data to investigate the Amati relation's behavior with the cosmological redshift. We employ a maximum likelihood analysis to estimate the Amati relation slope and scatter and test for the presence of selection and evolution effects. Our analysis shows that the apparent deviation of the Amati relation from its standard form is due to selection effects, namely the so-called flux bias, which introduces a bias in the sample of bursts that are detected and therefore affects the relation's slope and scatter. Our results suggest that the Amati relation is a reliable tool for studying the GRB population's properties and evolution.",1,0
"Our work involves studying the behavior of the two-dimensional N=(2,2) super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory on a computer. This theory is an important tool for understanding the behavior of quantum field theories in lower dimensions. The motivation for our research stems from the fact that traditional analytic methods are limited in their ability to fully understand these theories due to their complexity. Therefore, numerical simulations are necessary to gain deeper insights into their behavior.To accomplish this task, we employ lattice gauge theory simulations to investigate properties of the super Yang-Mills theory. The methodology involves discretizing the continuum theory onto a four-dimensional lattice and utilizing Monte Carlo techniques to perform numerical simulations. We utilize a specific algorithm, the Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) method, to efficiently generate gauge field configurations that are used to compute correlation functions in the super Yang-Mills theory.Our results show that HMC is a reliable method for simulating the super Yang-Mills theory. We also find that the symmetry properties of the theory hold at short distances, while they break down at long distances. Our work highlights the importance of numerical simulations in understanding complex quantum field theories and opens the possibility for further exploration of the N=(2,2) super Yang-Mills theory in the future.",1,0
"We present deep imaging observations of Hercules, a dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph) located in the Local Group. Previous studies on this galaxy reported a compact morphology and a simple structure. However, our new observations, obtained with the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT), reveal an elongated structure along the major axis of the galaxy. This structure extends up to 1.5 degrees, which is about twice the size of the main body of the Hercules dSph. Our data also shows a significant spread in the stellar population, a clear asymmetry, and the presence of tidal features that may suggest a past interaction with the Milky Way or another neighboring galaxy.These results challenge the previously accepted picture of Hercules as a simple and isolated dwarf galaxy. The elongated shape and the presence of tidal features indicate that Hercules may have a more complex evolutionary history than initially thought. The new observations also suggest that Hercules could have more dark matter than expected, which could explain the elongated shape as a consequence of tidal disruption.Our study provides important insights into the nature of dwarf galaxies and their interaction with their environment. Further observations and modeling will be necessary to fully understand the nature and origin of the elongated structure and the history of Hercules. Our results illustrate the importance of deep imaging for a complete understanding of the properties and evolution of dwarf galaxies in the Local Group.",1,0
"In this study, we investigate the dust temperatures of prestellar cores within the rho Oph main cloud and other star-forming regions and explore the implications for the core mass function. Prestellar cores are dense, collapsing structures that form protostars and ultimately, young stellar objects. Understanding their properties and distribution is crucial for advancing our knowledge of star formation. We use infrared observations from the Herschel Space Observatory to estimate the dust temperatures of prestellar cores and compare them to theoretical predictions. Our analysis reveals that the dust temperatures of prestellar cores in the rho Oph main cloud are colder than those in other star-forming regions. We show that this has important consequences for the inferred properties of these structures, particularly their masses. Specifically, colder cores have higher masses than previously estimated, leading to a shift in the shape of the core mass function towards higher masses. Our findings have implications for our understanding of star formation and the origin of the initial mass function of stars.",1,0
"In this work, we investigate the presence of Hot Jupiters in binary star systems using data from the Kepler satellite. Our motivation for this research is to better understand how the formation and evolution of Hot Jupiters are affected by the presence of a companion star.

"In this study, we present a photometric analysis of the intermediate-age star cluster BS 90 in the star-forming region NGC 346 in the Small Magellanic Cloud. Our data were obtained using the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) on board the Hubble Space Telescope. The cluster BS 90 is located in the outskirts of NGC 346 and has a large population of intermediate-mass stars. We conducted star counts and determined the cluster radius to be9.4 pc. We also used the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) to estimate the distance modulus, reddening, and age of the cluster. We found that the cluster has a distance modulus of 18.84 ± 0.08 mag, a reddening of E(B-V) = 0.14 ± 0.02 mag, and an age of65 Myr. The CMD shows that there is a spread in the age of stars in the cluster, indicating that it may have undergone multiple episodes of star formation.The motivation for this research is to understand the age distribution and properties of intermediate-age clusters in NGC 346, which will help us to better understand the formation and evolution of star clusters in general. Our results suggest that BS 90 is a relatively young and metal-poor intermediate-age cluster, consistent with the properties of NGC 346 as a star-forming region. Our study highlights the importance of high-resolution, multi-band photometry for characterizing and understanding the properties of star clusters.",1,0
"In this study, we present evidence for two distinct subclasses of normal-bright Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) using data from SN 2005hj. We emphasize that this study has significant implications for cosmology, which relies heavily on the luminosity of SNe Ia as a standard candle. Our motivation for this research stems from the need to understand the intrinsic variation in the luminosity of SNe Ia and to improve our ability to standardize their brightness.We conducted a detailed analysis of the multi-band light curve and spectra of SN 2005hj, classified as a normal-bright SN Ia. We found that the peak luminosity of SN 2005hj is higher than that of typical normal-bright SNe Ia, but its decline rate is shallower. This led us to conclude that there are two distinct subclasses of normal-bright SNe Ia: high-luminosity/low-decline-rate (H-LL), and low-luminosity/high-decline-rate (L-HH).Our findings have implications for the use of SNe Ia as standard candles in cosmology, as the H-LL and L-HH subclasses follow different luminosity-decline rate relationships. This study provides a crucial step towards a better understanding of the complex nature of SNe Ia and will help to improve the precision of supernova cosmology.",1,0
"In this work, we investigate the universality of the concentration of dark matter halos at virialization. The motivation for this research is to understand the formation and evolution of dark matter halos, which are the foundation of galaxy formation. The concentration of dark matter halos is a key parameter that affects the properties of galaxies, such as their sizes and rotation velocities. Previous studies have suggested that the concentration may vary with halo mass and redshift. However, it is not clear whether there is a universal relationship between the concentration and other halo properties.To address this question, we use a suite of cosmological simulations that cover a wide range of halo masses and redshifts. We analyze the concentration-mass relation of dark matter halos at the point of virialization, when they reach a state of equilibrium with their surrounding environment. We find that the concentration has a weak dependence on halo mass and redshift, which suggests a universal profile for the dark matter density distribution. Our results have important implications for the modeling of galaxy formation and the interpretation of observational data. They also raise interesting questions about the physical processes that govern the formation and evolution of dark matter halos. Overall, this work contributes to a better understanding of the fundamental properties of the universe and its evolution.",1,0
"In this work, we present an investigation on the nature of optical nuclei in FR I radio-galaxies from ACS/HST imaging polarimetry. Our aim is to further understand the mechanisms and properties of compact optical nuclei, which have previously been found to be an intrinsic component of radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN). We analyzed high-resolution imaging data obtained with the Advanced Camera for Surveys/Hubble Space Telescope and polarimetric diagnostics to study the morphology, polarization, and spectral properties of these optical nuclei. Our results show that FR I radio-galaxies exhibit bimodal optical nuclei: one population with a compact core and another with a diffuse morphology. Furthermore, we found that the compact optical nuclei are highly polarized, suggesting the presence of a dominant non-thermal emission mechanism, while the diffuse nuclei are less polarized, indicating the dominance of thermal emission. Our findings suggest that the different types of optical nuclei in FR I radio-galaxies are likely associated with different emission mechanisms that are influenced by the physical properties of the surrounding environment. This work provides new insights into the complex nature of AGNs and contributes to a broader understanding of their evolution and impact on the surrounding universe.",1,0

"In this work, we report on the detection of very high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray emission from Cygnus X-1, the first stellar-mass black hole discovered. This result was obtained using the Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) telescopes, which provide very good sensitivity to gamma-rays in the TeV energy range. The observation campaign lasted for almost 6 years, from 2006 to 2012, and a total of 200 hours of data were collected.The VHE emission from Cygnus X-1 was detected with a statistical significance of 5.6 standard deviations, which makes it the first black hole to be detected in this energy range. The photon spectrum of the VHE emission was measured in the energy range of 0.15 TeV to 1.4 TeV. It appears to be very hard, with a spectral index of 1.5±0.2.The motivation for this research was to test the hypothesis that black holes accelerate particles to very high energies and release them in the form of VHE gamma-rays. This is a key question in high-energy astrophysics, and the observation of VHE gamma-rays from Cygnus X-1 provides evidence that black holes are indeed capable of producing such particles.Our methodology involved the use of the MAGIC telescopes, which are sensitive to gamma-rays in the 100 GeV to 50 TeV energy range. We observed Cygnus X-1 for a total of 200 hours and analyzed the data using a maximum likelihood method. The result obtained confirms the presence of a VHE emission from Cygnus X-1 and opens up new perspectives in the study of the high-energy processes occurring around black holes.",1,0
"We present a map of the day-night contrast of the extrasolar planet HD 189733b based on multidimensional atmospheric modeling. The key idea is to reveal the thermal structure of the planet and its connection to the key observational signatures. We address the problem of constructing a consistent three-dimensional model of the atmosphere, which accounts for the radiative transfer and the dynamical mixing. To this end, we use a comprehensive radiative transfer code coupled with a time-dependent general circulation model. Our results demonstrate a strong day-night contrast of the planetary temperature and a complex structure of the atmospheric circulation, which includes equatorial super-rotation and strong jet streams. We find that the hottest point on the planet's surface is shifted eastward from the substellar point and is located at the intersection of the day-side ascending branch of the Hadley circulation and the eastward-shifting hotspot. This work attempts to provide comprehensive insights into the atmospheric physics of exoplanets and to deepen our understanding of those objects as a class.",1,0
"In this study, we report on the observation of simultaneous magnetic order and large electric polarization at room temperature in BiFeO3 single crystals. The coexistence of magnetic and ferroelectric ordering in multiferroics such as BiFeO3 is of great interest for the development of advanced electronic devices. However, achieving such coexistence at room temperature remains a significant challenge.Through a combination of X-ray diffraction, magnetic measurements, and polarization measurements, we have shown that BiFeO3 single crystals indeed display both magnetic and ferroelectric ordering at room temperature. The observed magnetic order originates from antiferromagnetic coupling between the Fe ions, while the large electric polarization is due to the displacement of Bi ions from their center positions.Our work provides insight into the physical mechanisms that underlie the simultaneous coexistence of magnetic and ferroelectric ordering in BiFeO3 single crystals. Our findings have significant implications for the design and development of novel multiferroic electronic devices, such as magnetic sensors and electrically controllable memories. These results demonstrate the potential of BiFeO3 as a promising material for the development of multifunctional electronic devices.",1,0
"In our work titled 'Near-IR Spectra of Red Supergiants and Giants. I- Models with Solar and with Mixing-Induced Surface Abundance Ratios,' we examine the near-IR spectra of evolved massive stars through a combination of theoretical modeling and observational data. Our motivation for this research stems from the fact that red supergiants (RSGs) play a vital role in the chemical enrichment and energy input of the interstellar medium, and their spectra provide critical insights into their physical properties. We employ a URCHIN stellar atmosphere code to model the near-IR spectra of RSGs and giants with varying chemical compositions and surface abundance ratios. Specifically, we investigate the impact of the specific abundance ratios (C/O, N/O, etc.) on the spectrum of RSGs. Our results indicate that these mixing-induced abundance ratios can have significant effects on the emergent spectrums of these stars. We compare our theoretical models with observational data for RSGs in the LMC and find excellent agreement. This work provides critical insights into the nature of RSGs and their physical properties, which can inform various areas of astrophysical research and our understanding of the evolution and fate of massive stars.",1,0
"In this work, we present a search for single-top production using data collected by the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF) in proton-anti-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV. The study is motivated by the importance of single-top production as a valuable tool to test the electroweak sector of the Standard Model (SM), and explore possible new physics beyond the SM. We analyze events with one isolated lepton, missing transverse energy, and jets, selected from a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 9.4 fb^-1.The key idea behind the analysis is to discriminate between the signal and background processes by using a set of kinematical and topological variables, and optimize the selection criteria through simulations and data-driven methods. The main background processes considered are W+jets and top-pair production, which are estimated using dedicated control regions and theoretical calculations.We observe a significant excess of events in the signal region compared to the expected background, which is consistent with the SM prediction. We measure the single-top production cross-section, assuming the existence of a single top-quark with a mass of 172.5 GeV/c^2, and obtain a value of 3.04 ± 0.62 pb, consistent with previous CDF and D0 measurements. Our result contributes to the global precision measurement of the single-top production cross-section, and tests the SM prediction in a new kinematic regime.",1,0
"In this work, we present the optical and X-ray properties of the RX J1117.4+0743 ([VMF 98] 097) galaxy cluster, which is actively forming at a redshift of z=0.485. Our aim is to shed light on the physical mechanisms that lead to the formation and evolution of galaxy clusters, which represent the most massive structures in the universe.The optical analysis of the system has been performed by analyzing the colors and magnitudes of the individual galaxies in the cluster, allowing us to estimate their ages, star formation rates, and stellar masses. In addition, we have carried out an X-ray analysis of the intra-cluster medium, which provides us with information about the gas temperature, density, and metallicity.Our results suggest that RX J1117.4+0743 ([VMF 98] 097) is a young and dynamically active cluster, characterized by a peak in the X-ray surface brightness located to the south of the optical center. The stellar population of the cluster is dominated by intermediate-age and old galaxies, with a significant fraction of star-forming galaxies in the outskirts of the system. The relatively low metal content of the intra-cluster medium, compared to more mature systems, suggests that RX J1117.4+0743 ([VMF 98] 097) is still in an early stage of its evolution.This study is motivated by the need to understand the formation of the most massive structures in the universe, and to probe how they evolve over cosmic time. Our results provide important insights into the physical processes that shape the development of galaxy clusters, and highlight the potential of multiwavelength observations to unravel the intricate web of processes that govern the evolution of these complex systems.",1,0
"In this study, we conduct a census of the baryonic matter content within galaxy clusters and groups with the aim of improving our understanding of their formation and evolution. To achieve this goal, we analyze a sample of 13 groups and clusters with diverse morphologies and masses using X-ray observations from the Chandra X-ray Observatory and optical data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We investigate the overall distribution of baryons within these structures, including their gas and stars, and quantify the amount of missing baryons that could be found within warm-hot intergalactic gas (WHIM) in between the clusters and groups.Our results indicate that the overall baryon content within groups and clusters is significantly below the universal baryon fraction, suggesting the presence of a large amount of missing baryons. We estimate that if the missing baryons are hidden in WHIM, they could account for up to 50-70",1,0
"We present a study of Direct Photon plus Jet production in CMS Experiment at √(s)=14 TeV. Our work aims to investigate this process, which enables measuring strong interaction processes and testing perturbative QCD calculations. We analyze pp collision data collected by the CMS detector during Run 2 corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. The key idea is to measure the differential cross-section of the Direct Photon plus Jet process as a function of the kinematic variables, including the transverse momentum and the pseudorapidity of the photon and the jet, the azimuthal angle difference, and the invariant mass of the two objects.We develop a rigorous methodology to select events with high purity and good energy resolution and perform a detailed background estimation. We compare our data with theoretical predictions obtained from different Monte-Carlo generators to constrain the uncertainties of the QCD calculation and to search for new physics effects. We find good agreement between our data and the theoretical predictions within uncertainties.The results of our study provide valuable inputs to improve the precision of QCD predictions and would be useful for future studies in direct photon physics and jet substructure measurements. In addition, we investigate the potential of this process to constrain the parton distribution functions and extract the strong coupling constant α_s. Our findings demonstrate the capability of the CMS detector to study the QCD processes at the highest energy frontier.",1,0
"Our work titled 'The First Survey of X-ray Flares from Gamma Ray Bursts Observed by Swift: Spectral Properties and Energetics' presents an analysis of high-energy emission from Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) using data from the Swift satellite. Our aim is to characterize X-ray flares emitted by GRBs and investigate the associated spectral properties and energetics.We utilized Swift's Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) to identify 90 GRBs and their corresponding afterglows, and analyzed their X-ray flares with Swift's X-Ray Telescope (XRT). From our results, we find that X-ray flares in GRBs can be divided into two types based on their spectral properties: hard and soft flares. Additionally, we calculate the energetics of the flares and find that they contribute a significant fraction of the total energy released by the GRBs.Our study aims to solve the problem of understanding the physical mechanisms that drive X-ray flares in GRBs, which have remained a mystery since their discovery. Our results suggest that X-ray flares are produced by internal shocks within the GRB outflow, and provide insight into the amount of energy released during these processes.Overall, our study represents the first comprehensive survey of X-ray flares from GRBs using Swift data, and lays the foundation for future studies in this field.",1,0
"In this work, we present Spitzer spectral line mapping observations of four supernova remnants (SNRs): 3C391, W28, IC443, and W44. The primary objective of this study is to explore the infrared emission of these remnants and to provide a more detailed understanding of the physical conditions of the gas and dust within them. The observed emission lines cover a range of excitation potentials, from [Ne II] at 12.8um to [O IV] at 25.9um.To analyze the spectral data, we employ principal component analysis (PCA) to identify the underlying physical processes responsible for the observed line emission. PCA reveals distinct components for each SNR, with each component corresponding to specific emission lines that are likely produced by a particular physical process. Our PCA analysis indicates that the dominant physical mechanisms in the SNRs include shocks, radiative excitation, photoionization, and photon heating.This work presents an important step forward in our understanding of the physical conditions of SNRs and highlights the power of PCA as a method to interpret complex spectral line data. The detailed information provided by this technique enables us to better quantify the energy input and output in these objects, and to constrain models of SNR evolution. The results of this study will inform future observational and theoretical efforts in the field of supernova remnants and their impact on the interstellar medium.",1,0
