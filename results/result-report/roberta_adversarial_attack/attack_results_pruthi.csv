"  We address the problem of constructing high-accuracy, faithful analytic waveforms describing the gravitational wave signal emitted by inspiralling and coalescing binary black holes. We work within the Effective-One-Body (EOB) framework and propose a methodology for improving the current (waveform)implementations of this framework based on understanding, element by element, the physics behind each feature of the waveform, and on systematically comparing various EOB-based waveforms with ``exact'' waveforms obtained by numerical relativity approaches. The present paper focuses on small-mass-ratio non-spinning binary systems, which can be conveniently studied by Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli-type methods. Our results include: (i) a resummed, 3PN-accurate description of the inspiral waveform, (ii) a better description of radiation reaction during the plunge, (iii) a refined analytic expression for the plunge waveform, (iv) an improved treatment of the matching between the plunge and ring-down waveforms. This improved implementation of the EOB approach allows us to construct complete analytic waveforms which exhibit a remarkable agreement with the ``exact'' ones in modulus, frequency and phase. In particular, the analytic and numerical waveforms stay in phase, during the whole process, within $\pm 1.1 %$ of a cycle. We expect that the extension of our methodology to the comparable-mass case will be able to generate comparably accurate analytic waveforms of direct use for the ground-based network of <font color = red>interferometric</font> detectors of gravitational waves.

"  We propose a <font color = red>pairing-based</font> method for cooling an atomic Fermi gas. A three component (labels 1, 2, 3) mixture of Fermions is considered where the components 1 and 2 interact and, for instance, form pairs whereas the component 3 is in the normal state. For cooling, the components 2 and 3 are coupled by an electromagnetic field. Since the quasiparticle distributions in the paired and in the normal states are different, the coupling leads to cooling of the normal state even when initially $T_{paired}\geq T_{normal}$ (notation $T_S\geq T_N$). The cooling efficiency is given by the pairing energy and by the linewidth of the coupling field. No superfluidity is required: any type of pairing, or other phenomenon that produces a suitable spectral density, is sufficient. In principle, the paired state could be cooled as well but this requires $T_N<T_S$. The method has a conceptual analogy to cooling based on superconductor -- normal metal (SN) tunneling junctions. Main differences arise from the exact momentum conservation in the case of the field-matter coupling vs. non-conservation of momentum in the solid state tunneling process. Moreover, the role of processes that relax the energy conservation requirement in the tunneling, e.g. thermal fluctuations of an external reservoir, is now played by the linewidth of the field. The proposed method should be experimentally feasible due to its close connection to RF-spectroscopy of ultracold gases which is already in use.

"  Energetic feedback processes during the formation of galaxy clusters may have heated and ionized a large fraction of the intergalactic gas in proto-cluster regions. When such a highly ionized hot ``super-bubble'' falls along the sightline to a background quasar, it would be seen as a large void, with little or no absorption, in the Lyman alpha forest. We examine the spectra of 137 quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, to search for such voids, and find no clear evidence of their existence. The size <font color = red>distribution</font> of voids in the range 5-70 Angstrom (corresponding to physical sizes of approximately 3-35 comoving Mpc/h) is consistent with the standard model for the Lyman alpha forest without additional hot bubbles. We adapt a physical model for HII bubble growth during cosmological reionization (Furlanetto, Zaldarriaga and Hernquist 2004), to describe the expected size-distribution of hot super-bubbles at redshift around z = 3. This model incorporates the conjoining of bubbles around individual neighboring galaxies. Using the non-detection of voids, we find that models in which the volume filling factor of hot bubbles exceeds approximately 20 percent at z=3 can be ruled out, primarily because they overproduce the number of large (40-50 Angstrom) voids. We conclude that any pre-heating mechanism that explains galaxy cluster observations must avoid heating the low-density gas in the proto-cluster regions, either by operating relatively recently (z<3) or by depositing entropy in the high-density regions.

"  Using a semi-analytical model for galaxy formation, combined with a large N-body simulation, we investigate the origin of the dichotomy among early-type galaxies. We find that boxy galaxies originate from mergers with a progenitor mass ratio $n < 2$ and with a combined cold gas mass fraction $F_{\rm cold} < 0.1$. Our model accurately reproduces the observed fraction of boxy systems as a function of luminosity and halo mass, for both central galaxies and satellites. After correcting for the stellar mass dependence, the properties of the last major merger of early-type galaxies are independent of their halo mass. This provides theoretical support for the conjecture of Pasquali et al (2007) that the stellar mass of an early-type galaxy is the main parameter that governs its isophotal shape. We argue that the observed dichotomy of early-type galaxies has a natural explanation within <font color = red>hierarchical</font> structure formation, and does not require AGN feedback. Rather, we argue that it owes to the fact that more massive systems (i) have more massive progenitors, (ii) assemble later, and (iii) have a larger fraction of early-type progenitors. Each of these three trends causes the cold gas mass fraction of the progenitors of more massive early-types to be lower, so that their last major merger was dryer. Finally, our model predicts that (i) less than 10 percent of all early-type galaxies form in major mergers that involve two early-type progenitors, (ii) more than 95 percent of all boxy early-type galaxies with $M_* < 2 \times 10^{10} h^{-1} \Msun$ are satellite galaxies, and (iii) about 70 percent of all low mass early-types do not form a supermassive black hole binary at their last major merger. The latter may help to explain why low mass early-types have central cusps, while their massive counterparts have cores.

Studies have shown that Fermi gases can be cooled below their Fermi temperature by pairing fermions into composite bosons.   The key idea behind our work is to make use of this pairing mechanism to cool the Fermi gas even further. We propose to control the interaction between the fermions and the composite bosons by tuning external magnetic fields. Our methodology involves using numerical simulations to study the thermalization time scale of the Bose-Fermi mixture, as well as the overall cooling efficiency.   The problem we attempt to solve is the lack of efficient cooling methods for Fermi gases. Our pairing-based cooling scheme offers a new avenue to achieve this goal. By using composite bosons to reduce the number of fermions, we can increase the density of the gas for a given temperature. Our results show that this method is effective in cooling a Fermi gas to lower temperatures than traditional cooling methods. We believe that our work has the potential to <font color = green>contribute</font> to the development of more efficient cooling methods for ultracold atomic gases.","We present our work on pairing based cooling of Fermi gases.

"In this study, we explore constraints on the abundance of highly ionized proto-cluster regions by examining the absence of large voids in the Lyman Alpha forest. Proto-cluster regions, or regions of high-density gas that are the precursors of galaxy clusters, have been proposed as potential sources of ionizing radiation that can reionize the intergalactic medium. However, their abundance and <font color = green>contribution</font> to reionization remain uncertain.   Using a large sample of high-resolution Lyman Alpha forest spectra from the Keck telescopes, we measure the sizes of voids in the forest and compare them with theoretical predictions based on different assumptions for the properties of proto-clusters. Our results indicate that the abundance of highly ionized proto-cluster regions cannot be too large, and must be consistent with current estimates from simulations and observations. We also find that the sizes of voids in the forest are sensitive to the density contrast of proto-clusters, suggesting that future observations of void sizes can provide valuable constraints on the properties of these elusive objects.  Our methodology involves a careful analysis of the Lyman Alpha forest data, including the identification and measurement of voids using state-of-the-art algorithms. We also use Monte Carlo simulations to test the statistical significance of our results and the robustness of our conclusions. Overall, our study provides a new and valuable perspective on the role of proto-cluster regions in reionizing the Universe, and highlights the importance of combining observational and theoretical approaches to address fundamental questions in cosmology.","In this study, we explore constraints on the abundance of highly ionized proto-cluster regions by examining the absence of large voids in the Lyman Alpha forest.

"In this study, we investigated the origin of the dichotomy of early-type galaxies, particularly the role of dry mergers and AGN feedback in shaping their stellar populations and morphologies. Our findings reveal that galaxies that have undergone dry mergers and those that have been affected by AGN feedback occupy different regions in the color-magnitude diagram, indicating distinct evolutionary paths. Dry merging results in redder and more massive galaxies with older stellar populations, while AGN feedback leads to bluer and lower mass systems with younger stars.  We also find that AGN activity plays a significant role in the formation of the innermost regions of early-type galaxies, particularly the presence of the central black hole and its interactions with the surrounding gas. Moreover, we detect a correlation between the mass of the central black hole and the velocity dispersion of the host galaxy, suggesting a possible coevolutionary process.  The motivation for this work stems from the need to understand the diversity of early-type galaxies and to unveil the physical mechanisms responsible for their observed properties. Our results <font color = green>contribute</font> to the ongoing efforts to establish a comprehensive picture of galaxy evolution, shedding light on the intricate interplay between galaxy mergers, AGN activity, and star formation in the early universe.","In this study, we investigated the origin of the dichotomy of early-type galaxies, particularly the role of dry mergers and AGN feedback in shaping their stellar populations and morphologies.

"In this work, we report the discovery of high-velocity outflows in massive post-starburst galaxies at a redshift of 0.6. These outflows reach speeds of up to 1000 km/s and are thought to be driven by intense star formation and the growth of central black holes.   These outflows are important as they can have a significant impact on the evolution of galaxies by regulating the amount of gas available for star formation and enriching the intergalactic medium with heavy elements. However, the detection of such outflows and their contribution to galactic evolution is challenging due to their short-lived nature and complex kinematics.  Using observations from the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) at the Very Large Telescope, we study a sample of post-starburst galaxies and identify high-velocity outflows in approximately half of our sample. We analyze the kinematics and energetics of these outflows and find that they are consistent with being driven by intense star formation activity.  Our findings have important implications for our <font color = green>understanding</font> of galaxy evolution, as they suggest that these outflows may be a common feature of post-starburst galaxies at high redshifts and may play a significant role in regulating the growth and activity of massive galaxies.","In this work, we report the discovery of high-velocity outflows in massive post-starburst galaxies at a redshift of 0.6.

Our method <font color = green>introduces</font> a family of parameterized nonholonomic frame transforms, which enable a systematic and efficient exploration of the space of possible solutions. We demonstrate the power of our approach by considering several examples, including static spherically symmetric configurations, geodesic motion around a black hole, and gravitational waves.

Moreover, we show that our framework provides a natural language to describe non-trivial transformation properties of the solutions, which can shed light on the nature and symmetries of the underlying physical system. Our motivation for this research stems from the desire to understand the fundamental principles underlying gravity and to find new ways to test Einstein's theory in the most extreme regimes.

"In this paper, we present a study on the design of a Slide-o-Cam Transmission, which aims to provide a solution to the problem of limited torque control in traditional transmissions. Our key idea in this work is to combine the benefits of a variable mechanical advantage system with a cam mechanism to create a transmission capable of achieving a significant range of gear ratios in a compact and efficient package.  The methodology employed in this study involved a combination of theoretical analysis, experimental testing, and computer simulations. We first derived the equations of motion for the sliding components of the transmission and used them to generate force and displacement profiles for different operating conditions. We then built a prototype transmission and tested it under various loads and speeds to validate the theoretical predictions and identify areas for improvement. Finally, we developed a simulation model of the transmission using Matlab/Simulink to allow for more detailed analysis of the system performance.  Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the Slide-o-Cam Transmission in achieving high torque control in a compact, lightweight package. The transmission was found to have a wide range of gear ratios, high efficiency, and excellent load-carrying capacity, making it suitable for use in a variety of applications.

"In this study, we present new evidence of recent feedback energy release in the cores of two elliptical galaxies based on Spitzer observations of the transient, extended dust. The key ideas behind our research are to investigate the mechanisms powering the high-energy processes in the nuclei of early-type galaxies and to understand their impact on the interstellar medium (ISM). The methodology employed in this work involves the analysis of imaging and spectroscopic data obtained with the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) instrument on board the Spitzer Space Telescope. We detect extended dust features in the nuclei of NGC 5419 and IC 4296 that are spatially associated with outflows of hot gas and X-ray emission, indicative of an active galactic nucleus (AGN). Furthermore, we find that these dust structures have properties consistent with the presence of newly formed dust grains that have been heated by the AGN. The motivation for this study is to better understand the interplay between the AGN and the ISM in early-type galaxies, as this relationship has significant implications for galaxy evolution and the growth of supermassive black holes. Overall, our work represents a step forward in our <font color = green>understanding</font> of feedback processes in galaxy cores, and sheds light on the physical conditions under which dust can be created and destroyed in these environments.","In this study, we present new evidence of recent feedback energy release in the cores of two elliptical galaxies based on Spitzer observations of the transient, extended dust.

"In this study, we present the results of Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys (HST/ACS) coronagraphic observations of the dust surrounding HD 100546. The focus of our work is on the structure and morphology of the circumstellar dust disk and its interaction with a putative giant planet. The disk around HD 100546, which is known to contain evidence of both grain growth and dynamical interaction, presents a unique laboratory for investigating planet-disk interactions at an unusually advanced stage. Our observations reveal a relatively bright inner ring region that corresponds in location with a sharp rise in the spectral energy distribution. We found evidence for a gap beyond the ring, presumably carved by a massive protoplanet, and scattered light from dust particles presumably being displaced by the putative planet. The detailed structure of the disk is consistent with the presence of a relatively massive giant planet which injects sufficient energy to open a gap in the disk and simultaneously triggers the growth of a large inner ring via the Rossby vortices mechanism.

"In this study, we report the first CO J=6-5 and 4-3 detections in nearby ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), with a focus on the dense gas in Mrk231. Using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), we traced these molecular transitions in the central region of Mrk231, where we found evidence of an extremely dense, compact molecular gas structure. Our proposed models suggest that the observed CO emission arises from high-density gas associated with the central engine rather than a rotating disk, as typically seen in lower-luminosity systems.  Our work aims to shed light on the gas kinematics in ultra-luminous star-forming galaxies, which are key systems in the formation and evolution of galaxies through cosmic time. Our results suggest that the dense gas reservoir in Mrk231 is limited, and that the cooling rate is not sufficient to meet the observed high star-formation rate. Therefore, the cooling budget may be supplemented by other mechanisms, such as feedback from the active galactic nucleus.
