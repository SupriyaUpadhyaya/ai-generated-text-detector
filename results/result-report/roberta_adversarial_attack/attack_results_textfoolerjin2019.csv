"In this work, we present a novel approach to the computation of Faithful Effective-One-Body (EOB) waveforms of small-mass-ratio coalescing black-hole binaries.

"In this study, we explore constraints on the abundance of highly ionized proto-cluster regions by examining the absence of large voids in the Lyman Alpha forest. Proto-cluster regions, or regions of high-density gas that are the precursors of galaxy clusters, have been proposed as potential sources of ionizing radiation that can reionize the intergalactic medium. However, their abundance and contribution to reionization remain uncertain.   Using a large sample of high-resolution Lyman Alpha forest spectra from the Keck telescopes, we measure the sizes of voids in the forest and compare them with theoretical predictions based on different assumptions for the properties of proto-clusters. Our results indicate that the abundance of highly ionized proto-cluster regions cannot be too large, and must be consistent with current estimates from simulations and observations. We also find that the sizes of voids in the forest are sensitive to the density contrast of proto-clusters, suggesting that future observations of void sizes can provide valuable constraints on the properties of these elusive objects.  Our methodology involves a careful analysis of the Lyman Alpha forest data, including the identification and measurement of voids using state-of-the-art algorithms. We also use Monte Carlo simulations to test the statistical significance of our results and the robustness of our conclusions.

The key ideas behind our research are to <font color = red>enquiry</font> the mechanisms powering the high-energy processes in the nuclei of early-type galaxies and to understand their impact on the interstellar medium (ISM). The methodology employed in this work involves the analysis of imaging and spectroscopic data obtained with the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) instrument on board the Spitzer Space Telescope. <font color = red>Our</font> detect extended dust features in the nuclei of NGC 5419 and IC 4296 that are spatially associated with outflows of hot gas and X-ray emission, indicative of an active galactic nucleus (AGN). <font color = red>Too</font>, we find that these dust structures have properties consistent with the presence of newly formed dust grains that have been heated by the AGN.

"In this study, we present the results of Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys (HST/ACS) coronagraphic observations of the dust surrounding HD 100546. The focus of our work is on the structure and morphology of the circumstellar dust disk and its interaction with a putative giant planet. <font color = green>The</font> disk around HD 100546, which is known to contain evidence of both grain growth and dynamical interaction, presents a unique laboratory for investigating planet-disk interactions at an unusually advanced stage.

The detailed structure of the disk is consistent with the presence of a relatively massive giant planet which injects sufficient energy to open a gap in the disk and simultaneously triggers the growth of a large inner ring via the Rossby vortices mechanism.

"In this <font color = green>study</font>, we report the first CO J=6-5 and 4-3 detections in nearby ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), with a focus on the dense gas in Mrk231. <font color = green>Using</font> the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), we traced these molecular transitions in the central region of Mrk231, where we found evidence of an extremely dense, compact molecular gas structure.
