We work within the Effective-One-Body (EOB) framework and propose a methodology for improving the current (waveform)implementations of this framework based on understanding, element by element, the physics behind each feature of the waveform, and on systematically comparing various EOB-based waveforms with ``exact'' waveforms obtained by numerical relativity approaches. The present paper focuses on small-mass-ratio non-spinning binary systems, which can be conveniently studied by Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli-type methods. Our results include: (i) a resummed, 3PN-accurate description of the inspiral waveform, (ii) a better description of radiation reaction during the plunge, (iii) a refined analytic expression for the plunge waveform, (iv) an improved treatment of the matching between the plunge and ring-down waveforms. This improved implementation of the EOB approach allows us to construct complete analytic waveforms which exhibit a remarkable agreement with the ``exact'' ones in modulus, frequency and phase. In particular, the analytic and numerical waveforms stay in phase, during the whole process, within $\pm 1.1 %$ of a cycle. We expect that the extension of our methodology to the comparable-mass case will be able to generate comparably accurate analytic waveforms of direct use for the ground-based network of <font color = red>interferometric</font> detectors of gravitational waves. </td><td>  We address the problem of constructing high-accuracy, faithful analytic waveforms describing the gravitational wave signal emitted by inspiralling and coalescing binary black holes.

A three component (labels 1, 2, 3) mixture of Fermions is considered where the components 1 and 2 interact and, for instance, form pairs whereas the component 3 is in the normal state. For cooling, the components 2 and 3 are coupled by an electromagnetic field. Since the quasiparticle distributions in the paired and in the normal states are different, the coupling leads to cooling of the normal state even when initially $T_{paired}\geq T_{normal}$ (notation $T_S\geq T_N$). The cooling efficiency is given by the pairing energy and by the linewidth of the coupling field. No superfluidity is required: any type of pairing, or other phenomenon that produces a suitable spectral density, is sufficient. In principle, the paired state could be cooled as well but this requires $T_N<T_S$. The method has a conceptual analogy to cooling based on superconductor -- normal metal (SN) tunneling junctions. Main differences arise from the exact momentum conservation in the case of the field-matter coupling vs. non-conservation of momentum in the solid state tunneling process. Moreover, the role of processes that relax the energy conservation requirement in the tunneling, e.g. thermal fluctuations of an external reservoir, is now played by the linewidth of the field. The proposed method should be experimentally feasible due to its close connection to RF-spectroscopy of ultracold gases which is already in use. </td><td>  We propose a <font color = red>pairing-bxsed</font> method for cooling an atomic Fermi gas.

When such a highly ionized hot ``super-bubble'' falls along the sightline to a background quasar, it would be seen as a large void, with little or no absorption, in the Lyman alpha forest. We examine the spectra of 137 quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, to search for such voids, and find no clear evidence of their existence. The size <font color = red>distribution</font> of voids in the range 5-70 Angstrom (corresponding to physical sizes of approximately 3-35 comoving Mpc/h) is consistent with the standard model for the Lyman alpha forest without additional hot bubbles. We adapt a physical model for HII bubble growth during cosmological reionization (Furlanetto, Zaldarriaga and Hernquist 2004), to describe the expected size-distribution of hot super-bubbles at redshift around z = 3. This model incorporates the conjoining of bubbles around individual neighboring galaxies. Using the non-detection of voids, we find that models in which the volume filling factor of hot bubbles exceeds approximately 20 percent at z=3 can be ruled out, primarily because they overproduce the number of large (40-50 Angstrom) voids. We conclude that any pre-heating mechanism that explains galaxy cluster observations must avoid heating the low-density gas in the proto-cluster regions, either by operating relatively recently (z<3) or by depositing entropy in the high-density regions. </td><td>  Energetic feedback processes during the formation of galaxy clusters may have heated and ionized a large fraction of the intergalactic gas in proto-cluster regions.

We find that boxy galaxies originate from mergers with a progenitor mass ratio $n < 2$ and with a combined cold gas mass fraction $F_{\rm cold} < 0.1$. Our model accurately reproduces the observed fraction of boxy systems as a function of luminosity and halo mass, for both central galaxies and satellites. After correcting for the stellar mass dependence, the properties of the last major merger of early-type galaxies are independent of their halo mass. This provides theoretical support for the conjecture of Pasquali et al (2007) that the stellar mass of an early-type galaxy is the main parameter that governs its isophotal shape. We argue that the observed dichotomy of early-type galaxies has a natural explanation within <font color = red>hierarchical</font> structure formation, and does not require AGN feedback. Rather, we argue that it owes to the fact that more massive systems (i) have more massive progenitors, (ii) assemble later, and (iii) have a larger fraction of early-type progenitors. Each of these three trends causes the cold gas mass fraction of the progenitors of more massive early-types to be lower, so that their last major merger was dryer. Finally, our model predicts that (i) less than 10 percent of all early-type galaxies form in major mergers that involve two early-type progenitors, (ii) more than 95 percent of all boxy early-type galaxies with $M_* < 2 \times 10^{10} h^{-1} \Msun$ are satellite galaxies, and (iii) about 70 percent of all low mass early-types do not form a supermassive black hole binary at their last major merger. The latter may help to explain why low mass early-types have central cusps, while their massive counterparts have cores. </td><td>  Using a semi-analytical model for galaxy formation, combined with a large N-body simulation, we investigate the origin of the dichotomy among early-type galaxies.

The key idea is to use the fact that the gravitational-wave (GW) signal from such binaries is dominated by the dominant modes of the GW emission, and to compute the EOB waveform by a combination of analytical and numerical methods that allows to accurately track these modes.   Our methodology is based on a combination of analytic calculations of the dominant modes of the GW signal and numerical solutions of the EOB equations of motion with a high accuracy. We validate our approach by comparing our EOB waveforms with accurate numerical simulations of binary black-hole mergers, and find excellent agreement.   Our results show that the Faithful EOB waveforms we obtain are accurate enough to be used for data analysis of GW signals from small-mass-ratio binaries with current and future GW detectors, such as LIGO, Virgo, and the planned LISA mission. Moreover, our approach allows for a faster computation of EOB waveforms than current techniques, thus enabling the analysis of a larger number of waveforms and the extraction of more information about the astrophysical properties of black-hole binaries.

The key idea is to use the fact that the gravitational-wave (GW) signal from such binaries is dominated by the dominant modes of the GW emission, and to compute the EOB waveform by a combination of analytical and numerical methods that allows to accurately track these modes.   Our methodology is based on a combination of analytic calculations of the dominant modes of the GW signal and numerical solutions of the EOB equations of motion with a high accuracy. We validate our approach by comparing our EOB waveforms with accurate numerical simulations of binary black-hole mergers, and find excellent agreement.   Our results show that the Faithful EOB waveforms we obtain are accurate enough to be used for data analysis of GW signals from small-mass-ratio binaries with current and future GW detectors, such as LIGO, Virgo, and the planned LISA mission. Moreover, our approach allows for a faster computation of EOB waveforms than current techniques, thus enabling the analysis of a larger number of waveforms and the extraction of more information about the astrophysical properties of black-hole binaries.

Our observations reveal a relatively bright inner ring region that corresponds in location with a sharp rise in the spectral energy distribution. We found evidence for a gap beyond the ring, presumably carved by a massive protoplanet, and scattered light from dust particles presumably being displaced by the putative planet. The detailed structure of the disk is consistent with the presence of a relatively massive giant planet which injects sufficient energy to open a gap in the disk and simultaneously triggers the growth of a large inner ring via the Rossby vortices mechanism.

We demonstrate the power of our approach by considering several examples, including static spherically symmetric configurations, geodesic motion around a black hole, and gravitational waves. In all cases, we are able to derive exact solutions that are not only new, but also physically interesting and relevant to current astrophysical observations. Moreover, we show that our framework provides a natural language to describe non-trivial transformation properties of the solutions, which can shed light on the nature and symmetries of the underlying physical system. Our motivation for this research stems from the desire to understand the fundamental principles underlying gravity and to find new ways to test Einstein's theory in the most extreme regimes. By providing a powerful tool for generating exact solutions, our work offers a promising avenue for future investigations into the behavior of gravity in the presence of strong gravitational fields and in cosmological contexts.</td><td>We present a novel approach to the problem of finding exact solutions to the equations of motion in gravity. <font color = green>Ourselves</font> method introduces a family of parameterized nonholonomic frame transforms, which enable a systematic and efficient exploration of the space of possible solutions.
