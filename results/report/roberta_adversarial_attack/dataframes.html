      <td>We address the problem of constructing high-accuracy, faithful analytic waveforms describing the gravitational wave signal emitted by inspiralling and coalescing binary black holes. We work within the Effective-One-Body (EOB) framework and propose a methodology for improving the current (waveform)implementations of this framework based on understanding, element by element, the physics behind each feature of the waveform, and on systematically comparing various EOB-based waveforms with ``exact'' waveforms obtained by numerical relativity approaches. The present paper focuses on small-mass-ratio non-spinning binary systems, which can be conveniently studied by Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli-type methods. Our results include: (i) a resummed, 3PN-accurate description of the inspiral waveform, (ii) a better description of radiation reaction during the plunge, (iii) a refined analytic expression for the plunge waveform, (iv) an improved treatment of the matching between the plunge and ring-down waveforms. This improved implementation of the EOB approach allows us to construct complete analytic waveforms which exhibit a remarkable agreement with the ``exact'' ones in modulus, frequency and phase. In particular, the analytic and numerical waveforms stay in phase, during the whole process, within $\pm 1.1 %$ of a cycle. We expect that the extension of our methodology to the comparable-mass case will be able to generate comparably accurate analytic waveforms of direct use for the ground-based network of &lt;font color = red&gt;interferometric&lt;/font&gt; detectors of gravitational waves.</td>

      <td>We propose a &lt;font color = red&gt;pairing-based&lt;/font&gt; method for cooling an atomic Fermi gas. A three component (labels 1, 2, 3) mixture of Fermions is considered where the components 1 and 2 interact and, for instance, form pairs whereas the component 3 is in the normal state. For cooling, the components 2 and 3 are coupled by an electromagnetic field. Since the quasiparticle distributions in the paired and in the normal states are different, the coupling leads to cooling of the normal state even when initially $T_{paired}\geq T_{normal}$ (notation $T_S\geq T_N$). The cooling efficiency is given by the pairing energy and by the linewidth of the coupling field. No superfluidity is required: any type of pairing, or other phenomenon that produces a suitable spectral density, is sufficient. In principle, the paired state could be cooled as well but this requires $T_N&lt;T_S$. The method has a conceptual analogy to cooling based on superconductor -- normal metal (SN) tunneling junctions. Main differences arise from the exact momentum conservation in the case of the field-matter coupling vs. non-conservation of momentum in the solid state tunneling process. Moreover, the role of processes that relax the energy conservation requirement in the tunneling, e.g. thermal fluctuations of an external reservoir, is now played by the linewidth of the field. The proposed method should be experimentally feasible due to its close connection to RF-spectroscopy of ultracold gases which is already in use.</td>

      <td>Energetic feedback processes during the formation of galaxy clusters may have heated and ionized a large fraction of the intergalactic gas in proto-cluster regions. When such a highly ionized hot ``super-bubble'' falls along the sightline to a background quasar, it would be seen as a large void, with little or no absorption, in the Lyman alpha forest. We examine the spectra of 137 quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, to search for such voids, and find no clear evidence of their existence. The size &lt;font color = red&gt;distribution&lt;/font&gt; of voids in the range 5-70 Angstrom (corresponding to physical sizes of approximately 3-35 comoving Mpc/h) is consistent with the standard model for the Lyman alpha forest without additional hot bubbles. We adapt a physical model for HII bubble growth during cosmological reionization (Furlanetto, Zaldarriaga and Hernquist 2004), to describe the expected size-distribution of hot super-bubbles at redshift around z = 3. This model incorporates the conjoining of bubbles around individual neighboring galaxies. Using the non-detection of voids, we find that models in which the volume filling factor of hot bubbles exceeds approximately 20 percent at z=3 can be ruled out, primarily because they overproduce the number of large (40-50 Angstrom) voids. We conclude that any pre-heating mechanism that explains galaxy cluster observations must avoid heating the low-density gas in the proto-cluster regions, either by operating relatively recently (z&lt;3) or by depositing entropy in the high-density regions.</td>

      <td>Using a semi-analytical model for galaxy formation, combined with a large N-body simulation, we investigate the origin of the dichotomy among early-type galaxies. We find that boxy galaxies originate from mergers with a progenitor mass ratio $n &lt; 2$ and with a combined cold gas mass fraction $F_{\rm cold} &lt; 0.1$. Our model accurately reproduces the observed fraction of boxy systems as a function of luminosity and halo mass, for both central galaxies and satellites. After correcting for the stellar mass dependence, the properties of the last major merger of early-type galaxies are independent of their halo mass. This provides theoretical support for the conjecture of Pasquali et al (2007) that the stellar mass of an early-type galaxy is the main parameter that governs its isophotal shape. We argue that the observed dichotomy of early-type galaxies has a natural explanation within &lt;font color = red&gt;hierarchical&lt;/font&gt; structure formation, and does not require AGN feedback. Rather, we argue that it owes to the fact that more massive systems (i) have more massive progenitors, (ii) assemble later, and (iii) have a larger fraction of early-type progenitors. Each of these three trends causes the cold gas mass fraction of the progenitors of more massive early-types to be lower, so that their last major merger was dryer. Finally, our model predicts that (i) less than 10 percent of all early-type galaxies form in major mergers that involve two early-type progenitors, (ii) more than 95 percent of all boxy early-type galaxies with $M_* &lt; 2 \times 10^{10} h^{-1} \Msun$ are satellite galaxies, and (iii) about 70 percent of all low mass early-types do not form a supermassive black hole binary at their last major merger. The latter may help to explain why low mass early-types have central cusps, while their massive counterparts have cores.</td>

However, the existence of AGN feedback capable of halting galaxy-wide star formation has yet to be observationally confirmed. To investigate this question, we have obtained spectra of 14 post-starburst galaxies at z~0.6 to search for evidence of galactic winds. In 10/14 galaxies we detect Mg II 2796,2803 &lt;font color = red&gt;absorption&lt;/font&gt; lines which are blueshifted by 490 - 2020 km/s with respect to the stars. The median blueshift is 1140 km/s. We hypothesize that the outflowing gas represents a fossil galactic wind launched near the peak of the galaxy's activity, a few 100 Myr ago. The velocities we measure are intermediate between those of luminous starbursts and broad absorption line quasars, which suggests that feedback from an AGN may have played a role in expelling cool gas and shutting down star formation.</td>

      <td>Spitzer observations of extended dust in two optically normal elliptical galaxies provide a new confirmation of buoyant feedback outflow in the hot gas atmospheres around these galaxies. AGN feedback energy is required to prevent wholesale cooling and star formation in these &lt;font color = red&gt;group-centered&lt;/font&gt; galaxies. In NGC 5044 we observe interstellar (presumably PAH) emission at 8 microns out to about 5 kpc. Both NGC 5044 and 4636 have extended 70 microns emission from cold dust exceeding that expected from stellar mass loss. The sputtering lifetime of this extended dust in the ~1keV interstellar gas, ~10^7 yrs, establishes the time when the dust first entered the hot gas. Evidently the extended dust originated in dusty disks or clouds, commonly observed in elliptical galaxy cores, that were disrupted, heated and buoyantly transported outward. The surviving central dust in NGC 5044 and 4636 has been disrupted into many small filaments. It is remarkable that the asymmetrically extended 8 micron emission in NGC 5044 is spatially coincident with Halpha+[NII] emission from warm gas. A calculation shows that dust-assisted cooling in buoyant hot gas moving out from the galactic core can cool within a few kpc in about ~10^7 yrs, explaining the optical line emission observed. The X-ray images of both galaxies are disturbed. All timescales for transient activity - restoration of equilibrium and buoyant transport in the hot gas, dynamics of surviving dust fragments, and dust sputtering - are consistent with a central release of feedback energy in both galaxies about 10^7 yrs ago.</td>

To explain these colors, we explore the role of asymmetric scattering, reddening, and large minimum sizes on ISM-like grains. We conclude each of these hypotheses by itself cannot explain the colors. The disk colors are similar to those derived for Kuiper Belt objects, suggesting that the same processes responsible for their colors may be at work here. We argue that we are observing only the geometrically thick, optically thin envelope of the disk, while the optically thick disk responsible for the far-IR emission is undetected.

These observations are combined with CO J=3-2, HCN J=4-3 (this work), and CO J=2-1, J=1-0, 13CO J=2-1, HCN J=1-0 measurements taken from the literature to provide better constraints on the properties of the molecular gas in an extreme starburst/QSO in the local Universe. We find that the CO J=4-3 and J=6-5 transitions trace a different gas phase from that dominating the lower three CO transitions, with n(H_2) ~ (1-3)x10^4 cm-3 and Tk ~ (40-70) K. This phase is responsible for the luminous HCN emission, and contains most of the H2 gas mass of this galaxy. The total CO line cooling emanating from this dense phase is found similar to that of the [CII] line at 158 micron, suggesting a very different thermal balance to that seen in lower IR-luminosity galaxies, and one likely dominated by dense photon-dominated regions. Our dense "sampling" of the CO rotational ladder and the HCN lines enables us to produce well-constrained Spectral Line Energy Distributions (SLEDs) for the dense molecular gas in Mrk231 and compare them to those of high redshift starbursts, many of which have SLEDs that may be affected by strong lensing. Finally, we use our local molecular line excitation template to assess the capabilities of future cm and mm/sub-mm arrays in detecting CO and HCN transitions in similar systems throughout the local and distant universe.</td>

Our dense "sampling" of the CO rotational ladder and the HCN lines enables us to produce well-constrained Spectral Line Energy Distributions (SLEDs) for the dense molecular gas in Mrk231 and compare them to those of high redshift starbursts, many of which have SLEDs that may be affected by strong lensing. Finally, we use our local molecular line excitation template to assess the capabilities of future cm and mm/sub-mm arrays in detecting CO and HCN transitions in similar systems throughout the local and distant universe.</td>

      <td>In this work, we present a novel approach to the computation of Faithful Effective-One-Body (EOB) waveforms of small-mass-ratio coalescing black-hole binaries. The key idea is to use the fact that the gravitational-wave (GW) signal from such binaries is dominated by the dominant modes of the GW emission, and to compute the EOB waveform by a combination of analytical and numerical methods that allows to accurately track these modes.   Our methodology is based on a combination of analytic calculations of the dominant modes of the GW signal and numerical solutions of the EOB equations of motion with a high accuracy. We validate our approach by comparing our EOB waveforms with accurate numerical simulations of binary black-hole mergers, and find excellent agreement.   Our results show that the Faithful EOB waveforms we obtain are accurate enough to be used for data analysis of GW signals from small-mass-ratio binaries with current and future GW detectors, such as LIGO, Virgo, and the planned LISA mission. Moreover, our approach allows for a faster computation of EOB waveforms than current techniques, thus enabling the analysis of a larger number of waveforms and the extraction of more information about the astrophysical properties of black-hole binaries.  The motivation for this research is to provide accurate and &lt;font color = green&gt;computationally&lt;/font&gt; efficient methods for the analysis of GW signals from small-mass-ratio binary black-hole mergers, which are expected to be detected with increasing sensitivity in the near future. Our approach may lead to new discoveries about the nature and properties of black holes and their astrophysical environments.</td>

      <td>We present our work on pairing based cooling of Fermi gases. The motivation for this research arises from the need to achieve lower temperatures and higher density in ultracold atomic gases. This field aims to study the behavior of gases at temperatures close to absolute zero, where classical physics can no longer accurately explain their behaviors. Studies have shown that Fermi gases can be cooled below their Fermi temperature by pairing fermions into composite bosons.   The key idea behind our work is to make use of this pairing mechanism to cool the Fermi gas even further. We propose to control the interaction between the fermions and the composite bosons by tuning external magnetic fields. Our methodology involves using numerical simulations to study the thermalization time scale of the Bose-Fermi mixture, as well as the overall cooling efficiency.   The problem we attempt to solve is the lack of efficient cooling methods for Fermi gases. Our pairing-based cooling scheme offers a new avenue to achieve this goal. By using composite bosons to reduce the number of fermions, we can increase the density of the gas for a given temperature. Our results show that this method is effective in cooling a Fermi gas to lower temperatures than traditional cooling methods. We believe that our work has the potential to &lt;font color = green&gt;contribute&lt;/font&gt; to the development of more efficient cooling methods for ultracold atomic gases.</td>

      <td>In this study, we explore constraints on the abundance of highly ionized proto-cluster regions by examining the absence of large voids in the Lyman Alpha forest. Proto-cluster regions, or regions of high-density gas that are the precursors of galaxy clusters, have been proposed as potential sources of ionizing radiation that can reionize the intergalactic medium. However, their abundance and &lt;font color = green&gt;contribution&lt;/font&gt; to reionization remain uncertain.   Using a large sample of high-resolution Lyman Alpha forest spectra from the Keck telescopes, we measure the sizes of voids in the forest and compare them with theoretical predictions based on different assumptions for the properties of proto-clusters. Our results indicate that the abundance of highly ionized proto-cluster regions cannot be too large, and must be consistent with current estimates from simulations and observations. We also find that the sizes of voids in the forest are sensitive to the density contrast of proto-clusters, suggesting that future observations of void sizes can provide valuable constraints on the properties of these elusive objects.  Our methodology involves a careful analysis of the Lyman Alpha forest data, including the identification and measurement of voids using state-of-the-art algorithms. We also use Monte Carlo simulations to test the statistical significance of our results and the robustness of our conclusions. Overall, our study provides a new and valuable perspective on the role of proto-cluster regions in reionizing the Universe, and highlights the importance of combining observational and theoretical approaches to address fundamental questions in cosmology.</td>

Our findings reveal that galaxies that have undergone dry mergers and those that have been affected by AGN feedback occupy different regions in the color-magnitude diagram, indicating distinct evolutionary paths. Dry merging results in redder and more massive galaxies with older stellar populations, while AGN feedback leads to bluer and lower mass systems with younger stars.

These outflows reach speeds of up to 1000 km/s and are thought to be driven by intense star formation and the growth of central black holes.   These outflows are important as they can have a significant impact on the evolution of galaxies by regulating the amount of gas available for star formation and enriching the intergalactic medium with heavy elements. However, the detection of such outflows and their contribution to galactic evolution is challenging due to their short-lived nature and complex kinematics.  Using observations from the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) at the Very Large Telescope, we study a sample of post-starburst galaxies and identify high-velocity outflows in approximately half of our sample. We analyze the kinematics and energetics of these outflows and find that they are consistent with being driven by intense star formation activity.

Our proposed models suggest that the observed CO emission arises from high-density gas associated with the central engine rather than a rotating disk, as typically seen in lower-luminosity systems.  Our work aims to shed light on the gas kinematics in ultra-luminous star-forming galaxies, which are key systems in the formation and evolution of galaxies through cosmic time. Our results suggest that the dense gas reservoir in Mrk231 is limited, and that the cooling rate is not sufficient to meet the observed high star-formation rate. Therefore, the cooling budget may be supplemented by other mechanisms, such as feedback from the active galactic nucleus.

A successive iteration procedure results in new classes of solutions characterized by an infinite number of parameters for a &lt;font color = red&gt;non-AbTelian&lt;/font&gt; group involving arbitrary functions on one variable. &lt;font color = red&gt;Fiev&lt;/font&gt; classes of exact off-diagonal solutions are constructed in vacuum &lt;font color = red&gt;Eiastein&lt;/font&gt; and in string gravity describing solitonic &lt;font color = red&gt;p-pwave&lt;/font&gt; interactions. We explore possible physical consequences of such solutions derived from primary Schwarzschild or pp-wave metrics.</td>

      <td>In this study, we explore constraints on the abundance of highly ionized proto-cluster regions by examining the absence of large voids in the Lyman Alpha forest. Proto-cluster regions, or regions of high-density gas that are the precursors of galaxy clusters, have been proposed as potential sources of ionizing radiation that can reionize the intergalactic medium. However, their abundance and contribution to reionization remain uncertain.   Using a large sample of high-resolution Lyman Alpha forest spectra from the Keck telescopes, we measure the sizes of voids in the forest and compare them with theoretical predictions based on different assumptions for the properties of proto-clusters. Our results indicate that the abundance of highly ionized proto-cluster regions cannot be too large, and must be consistent with current estimates from simulations and observations. We also find that the sizes of voids in the forest are sensitive to the density contrast of proto-clusters, suggesting that future observations of void sizes can provide valuable constraints on the properties of these elusive objects.  Our methodology involves a careful analysis of the Lyman Alpha forest data, including the identification and measurement of voids using state-of-the-art algorithms. We also use Monte Carlo simulations to test the statistical significance of our results and the robustness of our conclusions. Overall, our study provides a new and valuable perspective on the role of proto-cluster regions in reionizing the Universe, and highlights the importance of combining observational and theoretical approaches to address fundamental questions in cosmology.</td>

Our findings reveal that galaxies that have undergone dry mergers and those that have been affected by AGN feedback occupy different regions in the color-magnitude diagram, indicating distinct evolutionary paths. Dry merging results in redder and more massive galaxies with older stellar populations, while AGN feedback leads to bluer and lower mass systems with younger stars.  We also find that AGN activity plays a significant role in the formation of the innermost regions of early-type galaxies, particularly the presence of the central black hole and its interactions with the surrounding gas.

      <td>In this work, we report the discovery of high-velocity outflows in massive post-starburst galaxies at a redshift of 0.6. These outflows reach speeds of up to 1000 km/s and are thought to be driven by intense star formation and the growth of central black holes.   These outflows are important as they can have a significant impact on the evolution of galaxies by regulating the amount of gas available for star formation and enriching the intergalactic medium with heavy elements. However, the detection of such outflows and their contribution to galactic evolution is challenging due to their short-lived nature and complex kinematics.  Using observations from the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) at the Very Large Telescope, we study a sample of post-starburst galaxies and identify high-velocity outflows in approximately half of our sample.

The disk around HD 100546, which is known to contain evidence of both grain growth and dynamical interaction, presents a unique laboratory for investigating planet-disk interactions at an unusually advanced stage. Our observations reveal a relatively bright inner ring region that corresponds in location with a sharp rise in the spectral energy distribution. We found evidence for a gap beyond the ring, presumably carved by a massive protoplanet, and scattered light from dust particles presumably being displaced by the putative planet.

      <td>In this study, we report the first CO J=6-5 and 4-3 detections in nearby ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), with a focus on the dense gas in Mrk231. Using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), we traced these molecular transitions in the central region of Mrk231, where we found evidence of an extremely dense, compact molecular gas structure. Our proposed models suggest that the observed CO emission arises from high-density gas associated with the central engine rather than a rotating disk, as typically seen in lower-luminosity systems.  Our work aims to &lt;font color = green&gt;shed&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color = green&gt;light&lt;/font&gt; on the gas kinematics in ultra-luminous star-forming galaxies, which are key systems in the formation and evolution of galaxies through cosmic time. Our results suggest that the dense gas reservoir in Mrk231 is limited, and that the cooling rate is not sufficient to meet the observed high star-formation rate.

      <td>In this study, we report the first CO J=6-5 and 4-3 detections in nearby ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), with a focus on the dense gas in Mrk231. Using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), we traced these molecular transitions in the central region of Mrk231, where we found evidence of an extremely dense, compact molecular gas structure. Our proposed models suggest that the observed CO emission arises from high-density gas associated with the central engine rather than a rotating disk, as typically seen in lower-luminosity systems.  Our work aims to &lt;font color = red&gt;sEhed&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color = red&gt;lilght&lt;/font&gt; on the gas kinematics in ultra-luminous star-forming galaxies, which are key systems in the formation and evolution of galaxies through cosmic time. Our results suggest that the dense gas reservoir in Mrk231 is limited, and that the cooling rate is not sufficient to meet the observed high star-formation rate. Therefore, the cooling budget may be supplemented by other mechanisms, such as feedback from the active galactic nucleus. A key outcome of our &lt;font color = red&gt;sytudy&lt;/font&gt; is that strong nuclear heating may be required in some ultra-luminous galaxies to offset the high cooling rate of their dense gas reservoirs and explain their ultraluminous infrared properties.

Proto-cluster regions, or regions of high-density gas that are the precursors of galaxy clusters, have been proposed as potential sources of ionizing radiation that can reionize the intergalactic medium. However, their abundance and contribution to reionization remain uncertain.   Using a large sample of high-resolution Lyman Alpha forest spectra from the Keck telescopes, we measure the sizes of voids in the forest and compare them with theoretical predictions based on different assumptions for the properties of proto-clusters. Our results indicate that the abundance of highly ionized proto-cluster regions cannot be too large, and must be consistent with current estimates from simulations and observations. We also find that the sizes of voids in the forest are sensitive to the density contrast of proto-clusters, suggesting that future observations of void sizes can provide valuable constraints on the properties of these elusive objects.  Our methodology involves a careful analysis of the Lyman Alpha forest data, including the identification and measurement of voids using state-of-the-art algorithms. We also use Monte Carlo simulations to test the statistical significance of our results and the robustness of our conclusions.

      <td>In this &lt;font color = red&gt;cogitation&lt;/font&gt;, we investigated the origin of the dichotomy of early-type galaxies, particularly the role of dry mergers and AGN feedback in shaping their stellar populations and morphologies. Our findings reveal that galaxies that have undergone dry mergers and those that have been affected by AGN feedback occupy different regions in the color-magnitude diagram, indicating distinct evolutionary paths. &lt;font color = red&gt;teetotal&lt;/font&gt; merging results in redder and more massive galaxies with older stellar populations, while AGN feedback leads to bluer and lower mass systems with younger stars.  We also find that AGN activity plays a significant role in the formation of the innermost regions of early-type galaxies, particularly the presence of the central black hole and its interactions with the surrounding gas. Moreover, we detect a correlation between the mass of the central black hole and the velocity dispersion of the host galaxy, suggesting a possible coevolutionary process.

      <td>In this work, we report the discovery of high-velocity outflows in massive post-starburst galaxies at a redshift of 0.6. These outflows reach speeds of up to 1000 km/s and are thought to be driven by intense star formation and the growth of central black holes.   These outflows are important as they can have a significant impact on the evolution of galaxies by regulating the amount of gas available for star formation and enriching the intergalactic medium with heavy elements. However, the detection of such outflows and their contribution to galactic evolution is challenging due to their short-lived nature and complex kinematics.  Using observations from the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) at the Very Large Telescope, we study a sample of post-starburst galaxies and identify high-velocity outflows in approximately half of our sample. We analyze the kinematics and energetics of these outflows and find that they are consistent with being driven by intense star formation activity.

The methodology employed in this study involved a combination of theoretical analysis, experimental testing, and computer simulations.

Finally, we developed a simulation model of the transmission using Matlab/Simulink to allow for more detailed analysis of the system performance.

The disk around HD 100546, which is known to contain evidence of both grain growth and dynamical interaction, presents a unique laboratory for investigating planet-disk interactions at an unusually advanced stage. Our observations reveal a relatively bright inner ring region that corresponds in location with a sharp rise in the spectral energy distribution.

Proto-cluster regions, or regions of high-density gas that are the precursors of galaxy clusters, have been proposed as potential sources of ionizing radiation that can reionize the intergalactic medium. However, their abundance and contribution to reionization remain uncertain.   Using a large sample of high-resolution Lyman Alpha forest spectra from the Keck telescopes, we measure the sizes of voids in the forest and compare them with theoretical predictions based on different assumptions for the properties of proto-clusters. Our results indicate that the abundance of highly ionized proto-cluster regions cannot be too large, and must be consistent with current estimates from simulations and observations. We also find that the sizes of voids in the forest are sensitive to the density contrast of proto-clusters, suggesting that future observations of void sizes can provide valuable constraints on the properties of these elusive objects.  Our methodology involves a careful analysis of the Lyman Alpha forest data, including the identification and measurement of voids using state-of-the-art algorithms. We also use Monte Carlo simulations to test the statistical significance of our results and the robustness of our conclusions.

      <td>In this work, we report the discovery of high-velocity outflows in massive post-starburst galaxies at a redshift of 0.6. &lt;font color = red&gt;Those&lt;/font&gt; outflows reach speeds of up to 1000 km/s and are thought to be driven by intense star formation and the growth of central black holes.   These outflows are important as they can have a significant impact on the evolution of galaxies by regulating the amount of gas available for star formation and enriching the intergalactic medium with heavy elements.

We demonstrate the power of our approach by considering several examples, including static spherically symmetric configurations, geodesic motion around a black hole, and gravitational waves. In all cases, we are able to derive exact solutions that are not only new, but also physically interesting and relevant to current astrophysical observations. Moreover, we show that our framework provides a natural language to describe non-trivial transformation properties of the solutions, which can shed light on the nature and symmetries of the underlying physical system. Our motivation for this research stems from the desire to understand the fundamental principles underlying gravity and to find new ways to test Einstein's theory in the most extreme regimes. By providing a powerful tool for generating exact solutions, our work offers a promising avenue for future investigations into the behavior of gravity in the presence of strong gravitational fields and in cosmological contexts.</td>
