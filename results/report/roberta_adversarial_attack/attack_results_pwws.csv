"  We address the problem of constructing high-accuracy, faithful analytic waveforms describing the gravitational wave signal emitted by inspiralling and coalescing binary <font color = red>black</font> holes. We work within the Effective-One-Body (EOB) framework and propose a methodology for improving the current (waveform)implementations of this framework based on understanding, element by element, the physics behind each feature of the waveform, and on systematically comparing various EOB-based waveforms with ``exact'' waveforms obtained by numerical relativity approaches. The <font color = red>present</font> paper focuses on small-mass-ratio non-spinning binary systems, which can be conveniently studied by Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli-type methods. Our results include: (i) a resummed, 3PN-accurate description of the inspiral waveform, (ii) a better description of radiation reaction during the plunge, (iii) a refined analytic expression for the plunge waveform, (iv) an improved <font color = red>treatment</font> of the <font color = red>matching</font> between the plunge and ring-down waveforms. This improved implementation of the EOB approach allows us to <font color = red>construct</font> <font color = red>complete</font> analytic waveforms which exhibit a remarkable <font color = red>agreement</font> with the ``exact'' ones in modulus, frequency and phase. In particular, the analytic and numerical waveforms stay in phase, during the <font color = red>whole</font> process, within $\<font color = red>pm</font> 1.1 %$ of a cycle.

"In this study, we explore constraints on the abundance of highly ionized proto-cluster regions by examining the absence of large voids in the Lyman Alpha forest. Proto-cluster regions, or regions of high-density gas that are the precursors of galaxy clusters, have been proposed as potential sources of ionizing radiation that can reionize the intergalactic medium. However, their abundance and contribution to reionization remain uncertain.   Using a large sample of high-resolution Lyman Alpha forest spectra from the Keck telescopes, we measure the sizes of voids in the forest and compare them with theoretical predictions based on different assumptions for the properties of proto-clusters. Our results indicate that the abundance of highly ionized proto-cluster regions cannot be too large, and must be consistent with current estimates from simulations and observations. We also find that the sizes of voids in the forest are sensitive to the density contrast of proto-clusters, suggesting that future observations of void sizes can provide valuable constraints on the properties of these elusive objects.  Our methodology involves a careful analysis of the Lyman Alpha forest data, including the identification and measurement of voids using state-of-the-art algorithms. We also use Monte Carlo simulations to test the statistical significance of our results and the robustness of our conclusions.

"In this work, we report the discovery of high-velocity outflows in massive post-starburst galaxies at a redshift of 0.6.
