                <td>In this work, we present a novel approach to the computation of Faithful Effective-One-Body (EOB) waveforms of small-mass-ratio coalescing black-hole binaries. The key idea is to use the fact that the gravitational-wave (GW) <font color = green>signal</font> from such binaries is dominated by the dominant modes of the GW emission, and to compute the EOB waveform by a combination of analytical and numerical methods that allows to accurately track these modes.   Our methodology is based on a combination of analytic calculations of the dominant modes of the GW <font color = green>signal</font> and numerical solutions of the EOB equations of motion with a high accuracy. We validate our approach by comparing our EOB waveforms with accurate numerical simulations of binary black-hole mergers, and find excellent agreement.

                <td>We present our work on pairing based cooling of Fermi gases. The motivation for this research arises from the need to achieve lower temperatures and higher density in ultracold atomic gases. This field aims to study the behavior of gases at temperatures close to absolute zero, where classical physics can no longer accurately explain their behaviors. Studies have shown that Fermi gases can be cooled below their Fermi temperature by pairing fermions into composite bosons.   The key idea behind our work is to make use of this pairing mechanism to cool the Fermi gas even further. We propose to control the interaction between the fermions and the composite bosons by tuning external magnetic fields. Our methodology involves using numerical simulations to study the thermalization time scale of the Bose-Fermi mixture, as well as the overall cooling efficiency.   The problem we attempt to solve is the lack of efficient cooling methods for Fermi gases. Our pairing-based cooling scheme <font color = green>offers</font> a <font color = green>new</font> avenue to achieve this goal.

                <td>In this study, we explore constraints on the abundance of highly ionized proto-cluster regions by examining the absence of large voids in the Lyman Alpha forest. Proto-cluster regions, or regions of high-density gas that are the precursors of galaxy clusters, have been proposed as potential sources of ionizing radiation that can reionize the intergalactic medium. However, their abundance and contribution to reionization remain uncertain.   Using a large sample of high-resolution Lyman Alpha forest spectra from the Keck telescopes, we measure the sizes of voids in the forest and compare them with theoretical predictions based on different assumptions for the properties of proto-clusters. Our results indicate that the abundance of highly ionized proto-cluster regions cannot be too large, and must be consistent with current estimates from simulations and observations. We also find that the sizes of voids in the forest are sensitive to the density contrast of proto-clusters, suggesting that future observations of void sizes can provide valuable constraints on the properties of these elusive objects.  Our methodology involves a careful analysis of the Lyman Alpha forest data, including the identification and measurement of voids using state-of-the-art algorithms. We also use Monte Carlo simulations to test the statistical significance of our results and the robustness of our conclusions. Overall, our study provides a new and valuable perspective on the role of proto-cluster regions in reionizing the Universe, and highlights the importance of combining observational and theoretical approaches to address fundamental questions in cosmology.</td>

These outflows reach speeds of up to 1000 km/s and are thought to be driven by intense star formation and the growth of central black holes.   These outflows are important as they can have a significant impact on the evolution of galaxies by regulating the amount of gas available for star formation and enriching the intergalactic medium with heavy elements. However, the detection of such outflows and their contribution to galactic evolution is challenging due to their short-lived nature and complex kinematics.  Using observations from the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) at the Very Large Telescope, we study a sample of post-starburst galaxies and identify high-velocity outflows in approximately half of our sample.
