"We address the problem of constructing high-accuracy, faithful analytic waveforms describing the gravitational wave signal emitted by inspiralling and coalescing binary black holes. We work within the Effective-One-Body (EOB) framework and propose a methodology for improving the current (waveform)implementations of this framework based on understanding, element by element, the physics behind each feature of the waveform, and on systematically comparing various EOB-based waveforms with “exact” waveforms obtained by numerical relativity approaches. The present paper focuses on small-mass-ratio non-spinning binary systems, which can be conveniently studied by Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli-type methods. Our results include: (i) a resummed, 3PN-accurate description of the inspiral waveform, (ii) a better description of radiation reaction during the plunge, (iii) a refined analytic expression for the plunge waveform, (iv) an improved treatment of the matching between the plunge and ring-down waveforms. This improved implementation of the EOB approach allows us to construct complete analytic waveforms which exhibit a remarkable agreement with the “exact” ones in modulus, frequency and phase. In particular, the analytic and numerical waveforms stay in phase, during the whole process, within ± 1.1",0,0
"We propose a pairing-based method for cooling an atomic Fermi gas. A three component (labels 1, 2, 3) mixture of Fermions is considered where the components 1 and 2 interact and, for instance, form pairs whereas the component 3 is in the normal state. For cooling, the components 2 and 3 are coupled by an electromagnetic field. Since the quasiparticle distributions in the paired and in the normal states are different, the coupling leads to cooling of the normal state even when initially T_paired≥ T_normal (notation T_S≥ T_N). The cooling efficiency is given by the pairing energy and by the linewidth of the coupling field. No superfluidity is required: any type of pairing, or other phenomenon that produces a suitable spectral density, is sufficient. In principle, the paired state could be cooled as well but this requires T_N<T_S. The method has a conceptual analogy to cooling based on superconductor – normal metal (SN) tunneling junctions. Main differences arise from the exact momentum conservation in the case of the field-matter coupling vs. non-conservation of momentum in the solid state tunneling process. Moreover, the role of processes that relax the energy conservation requirement in the tunneling, e.g. thermal fluctuations of an external reservoir, is now played by the linewidth of the field. The proposed method should be experimentally feasible due to its close connection to RF-spectroscopy of ultracold gases which is already in use. ",0,0
"Energetic feedback processes during the formation of galaxy clusters may have heated and ionized a large fraction of the intergalactic gas in proto-cluster regions. When such a highly ionized hot “super-bubble” falls along the sightline to a background quasar, it would be seen as a large void, with little or no absorption, in the Lyman alpha forest. We examine the spectra of 137 quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, to search for such voids, and find no clear evidence of their existence. The size distribution of voids in the range 5-70 Angstrom (corresponding to physical sizes of approximately 3-35 comoving Mpc/h) is consistent with the standard model for the Lyman alpha forest without additional hot bubbles. We adapt a physical model for HII bubble growth during cosmological reionization (Furlanetto, Zaldarriaga and Hernquist 2004), to describe the expected size-distribution of hot super-bubbles at redshift around z = 3. This model incorporates the conjoining of bubbles around individual neighboring galaxies. Using the non-detection of voids, we find that models in which the volume filling factor of hot bubbles exceeds approximately 20 percent at z=3 can be ruled out, primarily because they overproduce the number of large (40-50 Angstrom) voids. We conclude that any pre-heating mechanism that explains galaxy cluster observations must avoid heating the low-density gas in the proto-cluster regions, either by operating relatively recently (z<3) or by depositing entropy in the high-density regions.

"Using a semi-analytical model for galaxy formation, combined with a large N-body simulation, we investigate the origin of the dichotomy among early-type galaxies. We find that boxy galaxies originate from mergers with a progenitor mass ratio n < 2 and with a combined cold gas mass fraction F_ cold < 0.1. Our model accurately reproduces the observed fraction of boxy systems as a function of luminosity and halo mass, for both central galaxies and satellites. After correcting for the stellar mass dependence, the properties of the last major merger of early-type galaxies are independent of their halo mass. This provides theoretical support for the conjecture of Pasquali et al (2007) that the stellar mass of an early-type galaxy is the main parameter that governs its isophotal shape. We argue that the observed dichotomy of early-type galaxies has a natural explanation within hierarchical structure formation, and does not require AGN feedback. Rather, we argue that it owes to the fact that more massive systems (i) have more massive progenitors, (ii) assemble later, and (iii) have a larger fraction of early-type progenitors. Each of these three trends causes the cold gas mass fraction of the progenitors of more massive early-types to be lower, so that their last major merger was dryer. Finally, our model predicts that (i) less than 10 percent of all early-type galaxies form in major mergers that involve two early-type progenitors, (ii) more than 95 percent of all boxy early-type galaxies with M_* < 2 × 10^10 h^-1 are satellite galaxies, and (iii) about 70 percent of all low mass early-types do not form a supermassive black hole binary at their last major merger. The latter may help to explain why low mass early-types have central cusps, while their massive counterparts have cores. ",0,0
"Numerical simulations suggest that active galactic nuclei (AGNs) play an important role in the formation of early-type galaxies by expelling gas and dust in powerful galactic winds and quenching star formation. However, the existence of AGN feedback capable of halting galaxy-wide star formation has yet to be observationally confirmed. To investigate this question, we have obtained spectra of 14 post-starburst galaxies at z 0.6 to search for evidence of galactic winds. In 10/14 galaxies we detect Mg II 2796,2803 absorption lines which are blueshifted by 490 - 2020 km/s with respect to the stars. The median blueshift is 1140 km/s. We hypothesize that the outflowing gas represents a fossil galactic wind launched near the peak of the galaxy's activity, a few 100 Myr ago. The velocities we measure are intermediate between those of luminous starbursts and broad absorption line quasars, which suggests that feedback from an AGN may have played a role in expelling cool gas and shutting down star formation.

"A generalized geometric method is developed for constructing exact solutions of gravitational field equations in Einstein theory and generalizations. First, we apply the formalism of nonholonomic frame deformations (formally considered for nonholonomic manifolds and Finsler spaces) when the gravitational field equations transform into systems of nonlinear partial differential equations which can be integrated in general form. The new classes of solutions are defined by generic off-diagonal metrics depending on integration functions on one, two and three (or three and four) variables if we consider four (or five) dimensional spacetimes. Second, we use a general scheme when one (two) parameter families of exact solutions are defined by any source-free solutions of Einstein's equations with one (two) Killing vector field(s). A successive iteration procedure results in new classes of solutions characterized by an infinite number of parameters for a non-Abelian group involving arbitrary functions on one variable. Five classes of exact off-diagonal solutions are constructed in vacuum Einstein and in string gravity describing solitonic pp-wave interactions. We explore possible physical consequences of such solutions derived from primary Schwarzschild or pp-wave metrics. ",0,0
"The optimization of the pressure angle in a cam-follower transmission is reported in this paper. This transmission is based on Slide-o-Cam, a cam mechanism with multiple rollers mounted on a common translating follower. The design of Slide-o-Cam, a transmission intended to produce a sliding motion from a turning drive, or vice versa, was reported elsewhere. This transmission provides pure-rolling motion, thereby reducing the friction of rack-and-pinions and linear drives. The pressure angle is a suitable performance index for this transmission because it determines the amount of force transmitted to the load vs. that transmitted to the machine frame. Two alternative design strategies are studied, namely, (i) increase the number of lobes on each cam or (ii) increase the number of cams. This device is intended to replace the current ball-screws in Orthoglide, a three-DOF parallel robot for the production of translational motions, currently under development at Ecole Centrale de Nantes for machining applications.

"Spitzer observations of extended dust in two optically normal elliptical galaxies provide a new confirmation of buoyant feedback outflow in the hot gas atmospheres around these galaxies. AGN feedback energy is required to prevent wholesale cooling and star formation in these group-centered galaxies. In NGC 5044 we observe interstellar (presumably PAH) emission at 8 microns out to about 5 kpc. Both NGC 5044 and 4636 have extended 70 microns emission from cold dust exceeding that expected from stellar mass loss. The sputtering lifetime of this extended dust in the1keV interstellar gas,10^7 yrs, establishes the time when the dust first entered the hot gas. Evidently the extended dust originated in dusty disks or clouds, commonly observed in elliptical galaxy cores, that were disrupted, heated and buoyantly transported outward. The surviving central dust in NGC 5044 and 4636 has been disrupted into many small filaments. It is remarkable that the asymmetrically extended 8 micron emission in NGC 5044 is spatially coincident with Halpha+[NII] emission from warm gas. A calculation shows that dust-assisted cooling in buoyant hot gas moving out from the galactic core can cool within a few kpc in about10^7 yrs, explaining the optical line emission observed. The X-ray images of both galaxies are disturbed. All timescales for transient activity - restoration of equilibrium and buoyant transport in the hot gas, dynamics of surviving dust fragments, and dust sputtering - are consistent with a central release of feedback energy in both galaxies about 10^7 yrs ago.

"We present ACS/HST coronagraphic observations of HD 100546, a B9.5 star, 103 pc away from the sun, taken in the F435W, F606W, and F814W bands. Scattered light is detected up to 14” from the star. The observations are consistent with the presence of an extended flattened nebula with the same inclination as the inner disk. The well-known “spiral arms” are clearly observed and they trail the rotating disk material. Weaker arms never before reported are also seen. The inter-arm space becomes brighter, but the structures become more neutral in color at longer wavelengths, which is not consistent with models that assume that they are due to the effects of a warped disk. Along the major disk axis, the colors of the scattered-light relative to the star are Δ(F435W-F606W)0.0–0.2 mags and Δ(F435W-F814W) 0.5–1 mags. To explain these colors, we explore the role of asymmetric scattering, reddening, and large minimum sizes on ISM-like grains. We conclude each of these hypotheses by itself cannot explain the colors. The disk colors are similar to those derived for Kuiper Belt objects, suggesting that the same processes responsible for their colors may be at work here. We argue that we are observing only the geometrically thick, optically thin envelope of the disk, while the optically thick disk responsible for the far-IR emission is undetected. The observed spiral arms are then structures on this envelope. The colors indicate that the extended nebulosity is not a remnant of the infalling envelope but reprocessed disk material. ",0,0
"We report on detections of the high-excitation CO J=6-5, J=4-3 lines in Mrk231, a prototypical Ultra Luminous Infrared Galaxy (ULIRG) and Seyfert 1 QSO. These observations are combined with CO J=3-2, HCN J=4-3 (this work), and CO J=2-1, J=1-0, 13CO J=2-1, HCN J=1-0 measurements taken from the literature to provide better constraints on the properties of the molecular gas in an extreme starburst/QSO in the local Universe. We find that the CO J=4-3 and J=6-5 transitions trace a different gas phase from that dominating the lower three CO transitions, with n(H_2)(1-3)x10^4 cm-3 and Tk(40-70) K. This phase is responsible for the luminous HCN emission, and contains most of the H2 gas mass of this galaxy. The total CO line cooling emanating from this dense phase is found similar to that of the [CII] line at 158 micron, suggesting a very different thermal balance to that seen in lower IR-luminosity galaxies, and one likely dominated by dense photon-dominated regions. Our dense 'sampling' of the CO rotational ladder and the HCN lines enables us to produce well-constrained Spectral Line Energy Distributions (SLEDs) for the dense molecular gas in Mrk231 and compare them to those of high redshift starbursts, many of which have SLEDs that may be affected by strong lensing. Finally, we use our local molecular line excitation template to assess the capabilities of future cm and mm/sub-mm arrays in detecting CO and HCN transitions in similar systems throughout the local and distant universe.

"We study theoretically the propagation of a step-modulated optical field as it passes through a dispersive dielectric made up of a dilute collection of oscillators characterized by a single narrow-band resonance. The propagated field is given in terms of an integral of a Fourier type, which cannot be evaluated even for simple models of the dispersive dielectric. The fact that the oscillators have a low number density (dilute medium) and have a narrow-band resonance allows us to simplify the integrand. In this case, the integral can be evaluated exactly, although it is not possible using this method to separate out the transient part of the propagated field known as optical precursors. We also use an asymptotic method (saddle-point method) to evaluate the integral. The contributions to the integral related to the saddle-points of the integrand give rise to the optical precursors. We obtain analytic expressions for the precursor fields and the domain over which the asymptotic method is valid. When combined to obtain the total transient field, we find that the agreement between the solutions obtained by the asymptotic and the exact methods is excellent. Our results demonstrate that precursors can persist for many nanoseconds and the chirp in the instantaneous frequency of the precursors can manifest itself in beats in the transmitted intensity. Our work strongly suggests that precursors have been observed in many previous experiments. ",0,0
"We consider an electrostatic qubit, interacting with a fluctuating charge of single electron transistor (SET) in the framework of exactly solvable model. The SET plays a role of the fluctuating environment affecting the qubit's parameters in a controllable way. We derive the rate equations describing dynamics of the entire system for both weak and strong qubit-SET coupling. Solving these equation we obtain decoherence and relaxation rates of the qubit, as well as the spectral density of the fluctuating qubit's parameters. We found that in the weak coupling regime the decoherence and relaxation rates are directly related to the spectral density taken at Rabi or at zero frequency, depending on what a particular qubit's parameters is fluctuating. This relation holds also in the presence of weak back-action of the qubit on the fluctuating environment. In the case of strong back-action, such simple relationship no longer holds, even if the qubit-SET coupling is small. It does not hold either in the strong-coupling regime, even in the absence of the back-action. In addition, we found that our model predicts localization of the qubit in the strong-coupling regime, resembling that of the spin-boson model. ",0,0
"The Method of Invariant Grid (MIG) is an iterative procedure for model reduction in chemical kinetics which is based on the notion of Slow Invariant Manifold (SIM) [1-4]. Important role, in that method, is played by the initial grid which, once refined, gives a description of the invariant manifold: the invariant grid. A convenient way to get a first approximation of the SIM is given by the Spectral Quasi Equilibrium Manifold (SQEM) [1-2]. In the present paper, a flexible numerical method to construct the discrete analog of a Quasi Equilibrium Manifold, in any dimension, is presented. That object is named Quasi Equilibrium Grid (QEG), while the procedure Quasi Equilibrium Grid Algorithm. Extensions of the QEM notion are also suggested. The QEG is a numerical tool which can be used to find a grid-based approximation for the locus of minima of a convex function under some linear constraints. The method is validated by construction of one and two-dimensional grids for model hydrogen oxidation reaction. ",0,0
"We present the class of regular homogeneous T-models with vacuum dark fluid, associated with a variable cosmological term. The vacuum fluid is defined by the symmetry of its stress-energy tensor, i.e., its invariance under Lorentz boosts in a distinguished spatial direction (p_j=-ρ), which makes this fluid essentially anisotropic and allows its density to evolve. Typical features of homogeneous regular T-models are: the existence of a Killing horizon; beginning of the cosmological evolution from a null bang at the horizon; the existence of a regular static pre-bang region visible to cosmological observers; creation of matter from anisotropic vacuum, accompanied by very rapid isotropization. We study in detail the spherically symmetric regular T-models on the basis of a general exact solution for a mixture of the vacuum fluid and dustlike matter and apply it to give numerical estimates for a particular model which illustrates the ability of cosmological T-models to satisfy the observational constraints.

"Recent numerical simulations of binary black hole mergers show the possibility of producing very large recoil velocities (> 3000 km/s). Kicks of this magnitude should be sufficient to eject the final black hole from virtually any galactic potential. This result has been seen as a potential contradiction with observations of supermassive black holes residing in the centers of most galaxies in the local universe. Using an extremely simplified merger tree model, we show that, even in the limit of very large ejection probability, after a small number of merger generations there should still be an appreciable fraction (>50",0,0
"We have observed IRAS06468-0325 obtaining optical and infrared images through IJHKs and L' filters, K-band low-resolution spectroscopy, together with millimetre line observations of CO and CS. IRAS06468-0325 has a very unusual and enigmatic morphology with two components: a bright, close to point-like source (the diamond) and a sharp-edge ring-like structure (the ring). The source is not detected in the optical, at wavelengths shorter than the I-band. The diamond is seen in all the imaging bands observed. The ring-like structure in IRAS06468-0325 is clearly seen in the I, J, H, and Ks. It is not detected in the L'-band image. Infrared colours of the diamond are compatible with excess circumstellar emission and a young stellar nature. A strongly non-gaussian and moderately bright CO(1-0) and 13CO(2-1) lines are seen towards IRAS06468-0325, at v_LSR of 30.5 km s-1 (corresponding to a kinematic distance of 3 kpc). Very weak C18O(2-1) and CS(2-1) lines were detected. K-band spectra of the diamond and of the ring are similar both in the slope of the continuum and in the presence of lines supporting the idea that the ring is reflected light from the diamond. With the current data, a few different scenarios are possible to explain the morphology of this object. However, the available data seem to favour that the morphology of IRAS06468-0325 correspond to a young stellar multiple system in a transient stage where a binary co-exists with a circumbinary disc, similar to the case of GG Tau. In this case, the sharpness of the well-defined ring may be due to tidal truncation from dynamic interactions between components in a binary or multiple stellar system. IRAS06468-0325 may be an important rare case that illustrates a short-lived stage of the process of binary or multiple star formation. ",0,0
"Background: Duplication of genes is important for evolution of molecular networks. Many authors have therefore considered gene duplication as a driving force in shaping the topology of molecular networks. In particular it has been noted that growth via duplication would act as an implicit way of preferential attachment, and thereby provide the observed broad degree distributions of molecular networks.Results: We extend current models of gene duplication and rewiring by including directions and the fact that molecular networks are not a result of unidirectional growth. We introduce upstream sites and downstream shapes to quantify potential links during duplication and rewiring. We find that this in itself generates the observed scaling of transcription factors for genome sites in procaryotes. The dynamical model can generate a scale-free degree distribution, p(k)prop; 1/k^gamma;, with exponentgamma;=1 in the non-growing case, and withgamma;>1 when the network is growing.Conclusions: We find that duplication of genes followed by substantial recombination of upstream regions could generate main features of genetic regulatory networks. Our steady state degree distribution is however to broad to be consistent with data, thereby suggesting that selective pruning acts as a main additional constraint on duplicated genes. Our analysis shows that gene duplication can only be a main cause for the observed broad degree distributions, if there is also substantial recombinations between upstream regions of genes. ",0,0
"The past three decades of investigation on nuclear physics and pulsar astrophysics have seen gradual recognition that elastodynamic approach to the continuum mechanics of nuclear matter provides proper account of macroscopic motions of degenerate Fermi-matter constituting interior of the nuclear material objects, the densest of all known today. This paper focuses on one theoretical issue of this development which is concerned with oscillatory behavior of a viscoelastic solid globe in the regime of quasistatic, force-free, non-compressional oscillations less investigated in the literature compared to oscillations in the regime of standing shear waves. We show that in this case the problem of computing frequency and lifetime of spheroidal and torsional modes of non-radial shear vibrations damped by viscosity can be unambiguously resolved by working from the energy balance equation and taking advantage of the Rayleigh's variational method. The efficiency of this method is demonstrated by solid globe models of nuclear physics and pulsar astrophysics dealing with oscillations of a spherical mass of a viscoelastic Fermi-solid with homogeneous and non-homogeneous profiles of the bulk density, the shear modulus, and the shear viscosity.

"We examine the relationship between little Higgs and 5d composite models with identical symmetry structures. By performing an 'extreme' deconstruction, one can reduce any warped composite model to a little Higgs theory on a handful of sites. This allows us to use 4d intuition and the powerful constraints of nonlinear sigma models to elucidate obscure points in the original setup. We find that the finiteness of the Higgs potential in 5d is due to the same collective symmetry breaking as in the little Higgs. We compare a 4d and a 5d model with the same symmetry to the data. Reviewing the constraints on models related to the Minimal Composite Higgs (hep-ph/0412089), we see that it has difficulty in producing acceptable values for S, T, and m_top simultaneously. By contrast, in a global analysis, the Minimal Moose with custodial symmetry is viable in a large region of its parameter space and suffers from no numeric tunings. We conjecture that this result is generic for 4d and 5d models with identical symmetries. The data will less strongly constrain the little theory. ",0,0
"We consider the question of how large a subspace of a given bipartite quantum system can be when the subspace contains only highly entangled states. This is motivated in part by results of Hayden et al., which show that in large d x d–dimensional systems there exist random subspaces of dimension almost d^2, all of whose states have entropy of entanglement at least log d - O(1). It is also related to results due to Parthasarathy on the dimension of completely entangled subspaces, which have connections with the construction of unextendible product bases. Here we take as entanglement measure the Schmidt rank, and determine, for every pair of local dimensions dA and dB, and every r, the largest dimension of a subspace consisting only of entangled states of Schmidt rank r or larger. This exact answer is a significant improvement on the best bounds that can be obtained using random subspace techniques. We also determine the converse: the largest dimension of a subspace with an upper bound on the Schmidt rank. Finally, we discuss the question of subspaces containing only states with Schmidt equal to r. ",0,0
"Let M be a smooth manifold and letbe a codimension one, C^∞ foliation on M, with isolated singularities of Morse type. The study and classification of pairs (M,) is a challenging (and difficult) problem. In this setting, a classical result due to Reeb <cit.> states that a manifold admitting a foliation with exactly two center-type singularities is a sphere. In particular this is true if the foliation is given by a function. Along these lines a result due to Eells and Kuiper <cit.> classify manifolds having a real-valued function admitting exactly three non-degenerate singular points. In the present paper, we prove a generalization of the above mentioned results. To do this, we first describe the possible arrangements of pairs of singularities and the corresponding codimension one invariant sets, and then we give an elimination procedure for suitable center-saddle and some saddle-saddle configurations (of consecutive indices). In the second part, we investigate if other classical results, such as Haefliger and Novikov (Compact Leaf) theorems, proved for regular foliations, still hold true in presence of singularities. At this purpose, in the singular set, Sing() of the foliation , we consider weakly stable components, that we define as those components admitting a neighborhood where all leaves are compact. If Sing() admits only weakly stable components, given by smoothly embedded curves diffeomorphic to S^1, we are able to extend Haefliger's theorem. Finally, the existence of a closed curve, transverse to the foliation, leads us to state a Novikov-type result. ",0,0
"Charmless 3-body decays of B mesons are studied in the framework of the factorization approach. The nonresonant contributions arising from B→ P_1P_2 transitions are evaluated using heavy meson chiral perturbation theory (HMChPT). The momentum dependence of nonresonant amplitudes is assumed to be in the exponential form e^-α_NR p_B·(p_i+p_j) so that the HMChPT results are recovered in the soft meson limit p_i, p_j→ 0. In addition, we have identified another large source of the nonresonant signal in the matrix elements of scalar densities, e.g. <KK̅|s̅s|0>, which can be constrained from the decay B̅^0→ K_SK_SK_S or B^-→ K^-K_SK_S. The intermediate vector meson contributions to 3-body decays are identified through the vector current, while the scalar meson resonances are mainly associated with the scalar density. Their effects are described in terms of the Breit-Wigner formalism. Our main results are: (i) All KKK modes are dominated by the nonresonant background. The predicted branching ratios of K^+K^-K_S(L), K^+K^-K^- and K^-K_SK_S modes are consistent with the data within errors.

"In several classes of particle physics models – ranging from the classical Majoron models, to the more recent scenarios of late neutrino masses or Mass-Varying Neutrinos – one or more of the neutrinos are postulated to couple to a new light scalar field. As a result of this coupling, neutrinos in the early universe instead of streaming freely could form a self-coupled fluid, with potentially observable signatures in the Cosmic Microwave Background and the large scale structure of the universe. We re-examine the constraints on this scenario from the presently available cosmological data and investigate the sensitivity expected from the Planck satellite. In the first case, we find that the sensitivity strongly depends on which piece of data is used. The SDSS Main sample data, combined with WMAP and other data, disfavors the scenario of three coupled neutrinos at about the 3.5σ confidence level, but also favors a high number of freely streaming neutrinos, with the best fit at 5.2. If the matter power spectrum is instead taken from the SDSS Large Red Galaxy sample, best fit point has 2.5 freely streaming neutrinos, but the scenario with three coupled neutrinos becomes allowed at 2σ. In contrast, Planck alone will exclude even a single self-coupled neutrino at the 4.2σ confidence level, and will determine the total radiation at CMB epoch to Δ N_ν^eff = ^+0.5_-0.3 (1σ errors). We investigate the robustness of this result with respect to the details of Planck's detector. This sensitivity to neutrino free-streaming implies that Planck will be capable of probing a large region of the Mass-Varying Neutrino parameter space. Planck may also be sensitive to a scale of neutrino mass generation as high as 1 TeV. ",0,0
"We explore the implications of a possible cosmic ray (CR) background generated during the first supernova explosions that end the brief lives of massive Population III stars. We show that such a CR background could have significantly influenced the cooling and collapse of primordial gas clouds in minihaloes around redshifts of z15 - 20, provided the CR flux was sufficient to yield an ionization rate greater than about 10^-19 s^-1 near the center of the minihalo. The presence of CRs with energies less than approximately 10^7 eV would indirectly enhance the molecular cooling in these regions, and we estimate that the resulting lower temperatures in these minihaloes would yield a characteristic stellar mass as low as10 M_sun. CRs have a less pronounced effect on the cooling and collapse of primordial gas clouds inside more massive dark matter haloes with virial masses greater than approximately 10^8 M_sun at the later stages of cosmological structure formation around z10 - 15. In these clouds, even without CR flux the molecular abundance is already sufficient to allow cooling to the floor set by the temperature of the cosmic microwave background. ",0,0
"A new class of Erbium doped glasses with compositions xNa2O - (60-x)PbCl2 - 40P2O5 (x=0, 10, 20 and 30) were fabricated and characterized for optical properties. Absorption spectra were analyzed for important Judd-Ofelt parameters from the integrated intensities of various Er3+ glass absorption bands. Photoluminescence (PL) and its decay behavior studies were carried out for the transition 4I13/2 -> 4I15/2. A systematic correlation between the Judd-Ofelt parameter omega2 and the covalent nature of the glass matrix was observed, due to increased role of bridging oxygens in the glass network. The PL broadness and life times of 4I13/2_> 4I15/2 transition were typically in the range of 40-60nm and 2.13-2.5ms respectively.

"We use a semianalytic galaxy catalogue constructed from the Millennium Simulation to study the satellites of isolated galaxies in the LCDM cosmogony. This sample ( 80,000bright primaries, surrounded by178,000 satellites) allows the characterization, with minimal statistical uncertainty, of the dynamical properties of satellite/primary galaxy systems in a LCDM universe. We find that, overall, the satellite population traces the dark matter rather well: its spatial distribution and kinematics may be approximated by an NFW profile with a mildly anisotropic velocity distribution. Their spatial distribution is also mildly anisotropic, with a well-defined “anti-Holmberg” effect that reflects the misalignment between the major axis and angular momentum of the host halo. The isolation criteria for our primaries picks not only galaxies in sparse environments, but also a number of primaries at the centre of ”fossil” groups. We find that the abundance and luminosity function of these unusual systems are in reasonable agreement with the few available observational constraints. We recover the expected L_hostσ_sat^3 relation for LCDM models for truly-isolated primaries. Less strict primary selection, however, leads to substantial modification of the scaling relation. Our analysis also highlights a number of difficulties afflicting studies that rely on blind stacking of satellite systems to constrain the mean halo mass of the primary galaxies.",0,0
"Using a sample of almost 7000 strong MgII absorbers with 0.4 < z < 2.2 detected in the SDSS DR4 dataset, we investigate the gravitational lensing and dust extinction effects they induce on background quasars. After carefully quantifying several selection biases, we isolate the reddening effects as a function of redshift and absorber rest equivalent width, W_0. We find the amount of dust to increase with cosmic time as (1+z)^(-1.1 +/- 0.4), following the evolution of cosmic star density or integrated star formation rate. We measure the reddening effects over a factor 30 in E(B-V) and we find the dust column density to be proportional to W_0^(1.9 +/- 0.2), which provides an important scaling for theoretical modeling of metal absorbers. We also measure the dust-to-metals ratio and find it similar to that of the Milky Way.In contrast to previous studies, we do not detect any gravitational magnification by MgII systems. We measure the upper limit μ<1.10 and discuss the origin of the discrepancy. Finally, we estimate the fraction of absorbers missed due to extinction effects and show that it rises from 1 to 50",0,0
"The silver chalcogenides provide a striking example of the benefits of imperfection. Nanothreads of excess silver cause distortions in the current flow that yield a linear and non-saturating transverse magnetoresistance (MR). Associated with the large and positive MR is a negative longitudinal MR. The longitudinal MR only occurs in the three-dimensional limit and thereby permits the determination of a characteristic length scale set by the spatial inhomogeneity. We find that this fundamental inhomogeneity length can be as large as ten microns. Systematic measurements of the diagonal and off-diagonal components of the resistivity tensor in various sample geometries show clear evidence of the distorted current paths posited in theoretical simulations. We use a random resistor network model to fit the linear MR, and expand it from two to three dimensions to depict current distortions in the third (thickness) dimension. When compared directly to experiments on Ag_2±δSe and Ag_2±δTe, in magnetic fields up to 55 T, the model identifies conductivity fluctuations due to macroscopic inhomogeneities as the underlying physical mechanism. It also accounts reasonably quantitatively for the various components of the resistivity tensor observed in the experiments. ",0,0
"The vacuum dependence on boundary conditions in quantum field theories is analysed from a very general viewpoint. From this perspective the renormalization prescriptions not only imply the renormalization of the couplings of the theory in the bulk but also the appearance of a flow in the space of boundary conditions. For regular boundaries this flow has a large variety of fixed points and no cyclic orbit. The family of fixed points includes Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions. In one-dimensional field theories pseudoperiodic and quasiperiodic boundary conditions are also RG fixed points. Under these conditions massless bosonic free field theories are conformally invariant. Among all fixed points only Neumann boundary conditions are infrared stable fixed points. All other conformal invariant boundary conditions become unstable under some relevant perturbations. In finite volumes we analyse the dependence of the vacuum energy along the trajectories of the renormalization group flow providing an interesting framework for dark energy evolution. On the contrary, the renormalization group flow on the boundary does not affect the leading behaviour of the entanglement entropy of the vacuum in one-dimensional conformally invariant bosonic theories.

"The magnetoelectric behavior of BiFeO_3 has been explored on the basis of accurate density functional calculations. The structural, electronic, magnetic, and ferroelectric properties of BiFeO_3 are predicted correctly without including strong correlation effect in the calculation. Moreover, the experimentally-observed elongation of cubic perovskite-like lattice along the [111] direction is correctly reproduced. At high pressure we predicted a pressure-induced structural transition and the total energy calculations at expanded lattice show two lower energy ferroelectric phases, closer in energy to the ground state phase. Band-structure calculations show that BiFeO_3 will be an insulator in A- and G-type antiferromagnetic phases and a metal in other magnetic configurations. Chemical bonding in BiFeO_3 has been analyzed using various tools and electron localization function analysis shows that stereochemically active lone-pair electrons at the Bi sites are responsible for displacements of the Bi atoms from the centro-symmetric to the noncentrosymmetric structure and hence the ferroelectricity. A large ferroelectric polarization (88.7 μC/cm^2) is predicted in accordance with recent experimental findings. The net polarization is found to mainly (> 98",0,0
"To examine the evolution of giant molecular clouds in the stream of a hot plasma we performed two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations that take full account of self-gravity, heating and cooling effects and heat conduction by electrons. We use the thermal conductivity of a fully ionized hydrogen plasma proposed by Spitzer and a saturated heat flux according to CowieMcKee in regions where the mean free path of the electrons is large compared to the temperature scaleheight. Significant structural and evolutionary differences occur between simulations with and without heat conduction. Dense clouds in pure dynamical models experience dynamical destruction by Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability. In static models heat conduction leads to evaporation of such clouds. Heat conduction acting on clouds in a gas stream smooths out steep temperature and density gradients at the edge of the cloud because the conduction timescale is shorter than the cooling timescale. This diminishes the velocity gradient between the streaming plasma and the cloud, so that the timescale for the onset of KH instabilities increases, and the surface of the cloud becomes less susceptible to KH instabilities. The stabilisation effect of heat conduction against KH instability is more pronounced for smaller and less massive clouds. As in the static case more realistic cloud conditions allow heat conduction to transfer hot material onto the cloud's surface and to mix the accreted gas deeper into the cloud. ",0,0
"In this paper we demonstrate a technique of utilizing magnetically trapped neutral Rb-87 atoms to measure the magnitude and direction of stray electric fields emanating from surface contaminants. We apply an alternating external electric field that adds to (or subtracts from) the stray field in such a way as to resonantly drive the trapped atoms into a mechanical dipole oscillation. The growth rate of the oscillation's amplitude provides information about the magnitude and sign of the stray field gradient. Using this measurement technique, we are able to reconstruct the vector electric field produced by surface contaminants. In addition, we can accurately measure the electric fields generated from adsorbed atoms purposely placed onto the surface and account for their systematic effects, which can plague a precision surface-force measurement. We show that baking the substrate can reduce the electric fields emanating from adsorbate, and that the mechanism for reduction is likely surface diffusion, not desorption. ",0,0
"AIM: We have recently developed a microscopic Monte Carlo approach to study surface chemistry on interstellar grains and the morphology of ice mantles. The method is designed to eliminate the problems inherent in the rate-equation formalism to surface chemistry. Here we report the first use of this method in a chemical model of cold interstellar cloud cores that includes both gas-phase and surface chemistry. The surface chemical network consists of a small number of diffusive reactions that can produce molecular oxygen, water, carbon dioxide, formaldehyde, methanol and assorted radicals. METHOD: The simulation is started by running a gas-phase model including accretion onto grains but no surface chemistry or evaporation. The starting surface consists of either flat or rough olivine. We introduce the surface chemistry of the three species H, O and CO in an iterative manner using our stochastic technique. Under the conditions of the simulation, only atomic hydrogen can evaporate to a significant extent. Although it has little effect on other gas-phase species, the evaporation of atomic hydrogen changes its gas-phase abundance, which in turn changes the flux of atomic hydrogen onto grains. The effect on the surface chemistry is treated until convergence occurs. We neglect all non-thermal desorptive processes. RESULTS: We determine the mantle abundances of assorted molecules as a function of time through 2x10^5 yr. Our method also allows determination of the abundance of each molecule in specific monolayers. The mantle results can be compared with observations of water, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and methanol ices in the sources W33A and Elias 16. Other than a slight underproduction of mantle CO, our results are in very good agreement with observations. ",0,0
"Two types of active region feature prominent at transition region temperatures are identified in Hinode/EIS data of AR 10938 taken on 2007 January 20. The footpoints of 1 MK TRACE loops are shown to emit strongly in emission lines formed at log T=5.4-5.8, allowing the temperature increase along the footpoints to be clearly seen. A density diagnostic of Mg VII yields the density in the footpoints, with one loop showing a decrease from 3x10^9 cm^-3 at the base to 1.5x10^9 cm^-3 at a projected height of 20 Mm. The second feature is a compact active region transition region brightening which is particularly intense in O V emission (log T=5.4) but also has a signature at temperatures up to log T=6.3. The Mg VII diagnostic gives a density of 4x10^10 cm^-3, and emission lines of Mg VI and Mg VII show line profiles broadened by 50 km/s and wings extending beyond 200 km/s. Continuum emission in the short wavelength band is also found to be enhanced, and is suggested to be free-bound emission from recombination onto He^+. ",0,0
"We prove the Kirillov-Reshetikhin (KR) conjecture in the general case : for all twisted quantum affine algebras we prove that the characters of KR modules solve the twisted Q-system and we get explicit formulas for the character of their tensor products (the untwisted simply-laced case was treated by Najakima, and the untwisted case by the author). The proof is uniform and provides several new developments for the representation theory of twisted quantum affine algebras, including twisted Frenkel-Reshetikhin q-characters (expected by Frenkel-Reshetikhin and Frenkel-Mukhin). We also prove the twisted T-system. As an application we get explicit formulas for the twisted q-characters of fundamental representations for all types, including the formulas for types D_4^(3), E_6^(2) conjectured by Reshetikhin. We prove the formulas for KR modules in types A_n^(2) and D_4^(3) conjectured by Kuniba-Suzuki. Eventually our results imply the conjectural branching rules [HKOTT] to the quantum subalgebra of finite type. ",0,0
"We introduce the R cut-off covering spectrum and the cut-off covering spectrum of a complete length space or Riemannian manifold. The spectra measure the sizes of localized holes in the space and are defined using covering spaces called δ covers and R cut-off δ covers. They are investigated using δ homotopies which are homotopies via grids whose squares are mapped into balls of radius δ.On locally compact spaces, we prove that these new spectra are subsets of the closure of the length spectrum. We prove the R cut-off covering spectrum is almost continuous with respect to the pointed Gromov-Hausdorff convergence of spaces and that the cut-off covering spectrum is also relatively well behaved. This is not true of the covering spectrum defined in our earlier work which was shown to be well behaved on compact spaces. We close by analyzing these spectra on Riemannian manifolds with lower bounds on their sectional and Ricci curvature and their limit spaces. ",0,0
"When a source emits a gravity-wave (GW) pulse over a short period of time, the leading edge of the GW signal is redshifted more than the inner boundary of the pulse. The GW pulse is distorted by the gravitational effect of the self-energy residing in between these shells. We illustrate this distortion for GW pulses from the final plunge of black hole (BH) binaries, leading to the evolution of the GW profile as a function of the radial distance from the source. The distortion depends on the total GW energy released and the duration of the emission, scaled by the total binary mass, M. The effect should be relevant in finite box simulations where the waveforms are extracted within a radius of <100M. For characteristic emission parameters at the final plunge between binary BHs of arbitrary spins, this effect could distort the simulated GW templates for LIGO and LISA by a fraction of 0.001. Accounting for the wave distortion would significantly decrease the waveform extraction errors in numerical simulations. ",0,0
"Addition theorems are principal tools that express a function f (r±r') in terms of products of other functions that only depend on either r or r'. The best known example of such an addition theorem is the Laplace expansion of the Coulomb potential which possesses a characteristic two-range form. Guseinov [Chem. Phys. 309, 209 - 213 (2005)] derived one-range addition theorems for the Coulomb potential via the limit β→ 0 in previously derived one-range addition theorems for the Yukawa potential exp(-β | r-r'| ) /| r-r'|. At first sight, this looks like a remarkable achievement, but from a mathematical point of view, Guseinov's work is at best questionable and in some cases fundamentally flawed. One-range addition theorems are expansions in terms of functions that are complete and orthonormal in a given Hilbert space, but Guseinov replaced the complete and orthonormal functions by nonorthogonal Slater-type functions and rearranged the resulting expansions. This is a dangerous operation whose validity must be checked. It is shown that the one-center limit r' = 0 of Guseinov's rearranged Yukawa addition theorems as well as of several other addition theorems does not exist. Moreover, the Coulomb potential does not belong to any of the Hilbert spaces implicitly used by Guseinov. Accordingly, one-range addition theorems for the Coulomb potential diverge in the mean. Instead, these one-range addition theorems have to interpreted as expansions of generalized functions in the sense of Schwartz that converge weakly in suitable functionals. ",0,0
"A spectral method is described for solving coupled elliptic problems on an interior and an exterior domain. The method is formulated and tested on the two-dimensional interior Poisson and exterior Laplace problems, whose solutions and their normal derivatives are required to be continuous across the interface. A complete basis of homogeneous solutions for the interior and exterior regions, corresponding to all possible Dirichlet boundary values at the interface, are calculated in a preprocessing step. This basis is used to construct the influence matrix which serves to transform the coupled boundary conditions into conditions on the interior problem. Chebyshev approximations are used to represent both the interior solutions and the boundary values. A standard Chebyshev spectral method is used to calculate the interior solutions. The exterior harmonic solutions are calculated as the convolution of the free-space Green's function with a surface density; this surface density is itself the solution to an integral equation which has an analytic solution when the boundary values are given as a Chebyshev expansion. Properties of Chebyshev approximations insure that the basis of exterior harmonic functions represents the external near-boundary solutions uniformly. The method is tested by calculating the electrostatic potential resulting from charge distributions in a rectangle. The resulting influence matrix is well-conditioned and solutions converge exponentially as the resolution is increased. The generalization of this approach to three-dimensional problems is discussed, in particular the magnetohydrodynamic equations in a finite cylindrical domain surrounded by a vacuum. ",0,0
"We present a numerical study and analytical model of the optical near-field diffracted in the vicinity of subwavelength grooves milled in silver surfaces. The Green's tensor approach permits computation of the phase and amplitude dependence of the diffracted wave as a function of the groove geometry. It is shown that the field diffracted along the interface by the groove is equivalent to replacing the groove by an oscillating dipolar line source. An analytic expression is derived from the Green's function formalism, that reproduces well the asymptotic surface plasmon polariton (SPP) wave as well as the transient surface wave in the near-zone close to the groove. The agreement between this model and the full simulation is very good, showing that the transient 'near-zone' regime does not depend on the precise shape of the groove. Finally, it is shown that a composite diffractive evanescent wave model that includes the asymptotic SPP can describe the wavelength evolution in this transient near-zone. Such a semi-analytical model may be useful for the design and optimization of more elaborate photonic circuits whose behavior in large part will be controlled by surface waves. ",0,0
"The extraordinary astrometric accuracy of radio interferometry creates an important and unique opportunity for the discovery and characterization of exo-planets. Currently, the Very Long Baseline Array can routinely achieve better than 100 microarcsecond accuracy, and can approach 10 microarcsecond with careful calibration. We describe here RIPL, the Radio Interferometric PLanet search, a new program with the VLBA and the Green Bank 100 m telescope that will survey 29 low-mass, active stars over 3 years with sub-Jovian planet mass sensitivity at 1 AU. An upgrade of the VLBA bandwidth will increase astrometric accuracy by an order of magnitude. Ultimately, the colossal collecting area of the Square Kilometer Array could push astrometric accuracy to 1 microarcsecond, making detection and characterizaiton of Earth mass planets possible.RIPL and other future radio astrometric planet searches occupy a unique volume in planet discovery and characterization parameter space. The parameter space of astrometric searches gives greater sensitivity to planets at large radii than radial velocity searches. For the VLBA and the expanded VLBA, the targets of radio astrometric surveys are by necessity nearby, low-mass, active stars, which cannot be studied efficiently through the radial velocity method, coronagraphy, or optical interferometry. For the SKA, detection sensitivity will extend to solar-type stars. Planets discovered through radio astrometric methods will be suitable for characterization through extreme adaptive optics.The complementarity of radio astrometric techniques with other methods demonstrates that radio astrometry can play an important role in the roadmap for exoplanet discovery and characterization.

"The first goal of the article is to solve several fundamental problems in the theory of holomorphic bundles over non-algebraic manifolds: For instance we prove that stability and semi-stability are Zariski open properties in families when the Gauduchon degree map is a topological invariant, or when the parameter manifold is compact. Second we show that, for a generically stable family of bundles over a Kähler manifold, the Petersson-Weil form extends as a closed positive current on the whole parameter space of the family. This extension theorem uses classical tools from Yang-Mills theory developed by Donaldson (e.g. the Donaldson functional and the heat equation for Hermitian metrics on a holomorphic bundle). We apply these results to study families of bundles over a Kählerian manifold Y parameterized by a non-Kählerian surface X, proving that such families must satisfy very restrictive conditions. These results play an important role in our program to prove existence of curves on class VII surfaces. ",0,0
"There are nine metal-deficient stars that have Li abundances well below the Li plateau that is defined by over 100 unevolved stars with temperatures above 5800 K and values of [Fe/H] < -1.0. Abundances of Be have been determined for most of these ultra-Li-deficient stars in order to investigate the cause of the Li deficiencies. High-resolution and high signal-to-noise spectra have been obtained in the Be II spectral region near 3130 Åfor six ultra-Li-deficient stars with the Keck I telescope and its new uv-sensitive CCD on the upgraded HIRES. The spectrum synthesis technique has been used to determine Be abundances. All six stars are found to have Be deficiencies also. Two have measurable - but reduced - Be and four have only upper limits on Be. These results are consistent with the idea that these Li- and Be-deficient stars are analogous to blue stragglers. The stars have undergone mass transfer events (or mergers) which destroy or dilute both Li and Be. The findings cannot be matched by the models that predict that the deficiencies are due to extra-mixing in a subset of halo stars that were initially rapid rotators, with the possible exception of one star, G 139-8. Because the ultra-Li-deficient stars are also Be-deficient, they appear to be genuine outliers in population of halo stars used to determine the value of primordial Li; they no longer have the Li in their atmospheres that was produced in the Big Bang.

"In this article we give an algorithm for the computation of the number of rational points on the Jacobian variety of a generic ordinary hyperelliptic curve defined over a finite field of cardinality q with time complexity O(n^2+o(1)) and space complexity O(n^2), where n=log(q). In the latter complexity estimate the genus and the characteristic are assumed as fixed. Our algorithm forms a generalization of both, the AGM algorithm of J.-F.

The theta null values are computed with respect to a semi-canonical theta structure of level 2^ν p where ν >0 is an integer and p=char(_q)>2. The results of this paper suggest a global positive answer to the question whether there exists a quasi-quadratic time algorithm for the computation of the number of rational points on a generic ordinary abelian variety defined over a finite field.

"The aim of the present paper is to provide a global presentation of the theory of special Finsler manifolds. We introduce and investigate globally (or intrinsically, free from local coordinates) many of the most important and most commonly used special Finsler manifolds: locally Minkowskian, Berwald, Landesberg, general Landesberg, P-reducible, C-reducible, semi-C-reducible, quasi-C-reducible, P^*-Finsler, C^h-recurrent, C^v-recurrent, C^0-recurrent, S^v-recurrent, S^v-recurrent of the second order, C_2-like, S_3-like, S_4-like, P_2-like, R_3-like, P-symmetric, h-isotropic, of scalar curvature, of constant curvature, of p-scalar curvature, of s-ps-curvature. The global definitions of these special Finsler manifolds are introduced. Various relationships between the different types of the considered special Finsler manifolds are found. Many local results, known in the literature, are proved globally and several new results are obtained. As a by-product, interesting identities and properties concerning the torsion tensor fields and the curvature tensor fields are deduced. Although our investigation is entirely global, we provide; for comparison reasons, an appendix presenting a local counterpart of our global approach and the local definitions of the special Finsler spaces considered.

"We presented the result of a high resolution (FWHM 0.5”) 12 ks Chandra HRC-I observation of the starburst galaxy IC342 taken on 2 April 2006. We identified 23 X-ray sources within the central 30' x 30' region of IC342. Our HRC-I observation resolved the historical Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULX), X3, near the nucleus into 2 sources, namely C12 and C13, for the first time. The brighter source C12, with L(0.08-10keV)=(6.66±0.45)×10^38ergs^-1, was spatially extended ( 82 pc x 127 pc). From the astrometric registration of the X-ray image, C12 was at R.A.=03h:46m:48.43s, decl.=+68d05m47.45s, and was closer to the nucleus than C13. Thus we concluded that source was not an ULX and must instead be associated with the nucleus. The fainter source C13, with L(0.08-10keV)=(5.1±1.4) x 10^37ergs^-1 was consistent with a point source and located 6.51” at P.A. 240 degree of C12.We also analyzed astrometrically corrected optical Hubble Space Telescope and radio Very Large Array images, a comparison with the X-ray image showed similarities in their morphologies. Regions of star formation within the central region of IC342 were clearly visible in HST H alpha image and this was the region where 3 optical star clusters and correspondingly our detected X-ray source C12 were observed. We found that a predicted X-ray emission from starburst was very close to the observed X-ray luminosity of C12, suggesting that nuclear X-ray emission in IC342 was dominated by starburst. Furthermore, we discussed the possibility of AGN in the nucleus of IC342. Although our data was not enough to give a firm existence of an AGN, it could not be discarded.",0,0

"A game-theoretic framework is used to study the effect of constellation size on the energy efficiency of wireless networks for M-QAM modulation. A non-cooperative game is proposed in which each user seeks to choose its transmit power (and possibly transmit symbol rate) as well as the constellation size in order to maximize its own utility while satisfying its delay quality-of-service (QoS) constraint. The utility function used here measures the number of reliable bits transmitted per joule of energy consumed, and is particularly suitable for energy-constrained networks. The best-response strategies and Nash equilibrium solution for the proposed game are derived. It is shown that in order to maximize its utility (in bits per joule), a user must choose the lowest constellation size that can accommodate the user's delay constraint. Using this framework, the tradeoffs among energy efficiency, delay, throughput and constellation size are also studied and quantified. The effect of trellis-coded modulation on energy efficiency is also discussed. ",0,0
"Review of recent works devoted to the variation of the fundamental constants is presented including atomic clocks, quasar absorption spectra, and Oklo natural nuclear reactor data. Assuming linear variation with time we can compare different results. From the quasar absorption spectra:μ̇/μ=(1 ± 3) × 10^-16 yr^-1. A combination of this result and the atomic clock results gives the best limt on variation of α: α̇/α=(-0.8 ± 0.8) × 10^-16 yr^-1. The Oklo natural reactor gives the best limit on the variation of m_s/Λ_QCD where m_s is the strange quark mass.Huge enhancement of the relative variation effects happens in transitions between close atomic, molecular and nuclear energy levels. We suggest several new cases where the levels are very narrow. Large enhancement of the variation effects is also possible in cold atomic and molecular collisions near Feshbach resonance. Massive bodies (stars or galaxies) can also affect physical constants. They have large scalar charge S proportional to number of particles which produces a Coulomb-like scalar field U=S/r. This leads to a variation of the fundamental constants proportional to the gravitational potential, e.g. δα/ α = k_αδ (GM/ r c^2).

"A quantum system composed of two or more subsystems can be in an entangled state, i.e. a state in which the properties of the global system are well defined but the properties of each subsystem are not. Entanglement is at the heart of quantum physics, both for its conceptual foundations and for applications in information processing and quantum communication. Remarkably, entanglement can be 'swapped': if one prepares two independent entangled pairs A1-A2 and B1-B2, a joint measurement on A1 and B1 (called a 'Bell-State Measurement', BSM) has the effect of projecting A2 and B2 onto an entangled state, although these two particles have never interacted or shared any common past[1,2]. Experiments using twin photons produced by spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) have already demonstrated entanglement swapping[3-6], but here we present its first realization using continuous wave (CW) sources, as originally proposed[2]. The challenge was to achieve sufficiently sharp synchronization of the photons in the BSM. Using narrow-band filters, the coherence time of the photons that undergo the BSM is significantly increased, exceeding the temporal resolution of the detectors. Hence pulsed sources can be replaced by CW sources, which do not require any synchronization[6,7], allowing for the first time the use of completely autonomous sources. Our experiment exploits recent progress in the time precision of photon detectors, in the efficiency of photon pair production by SPDC with waveguides in nonlinear crystals[8], and in the stability of narrow-band filters. This approach is independent of the form of entanglement; we employed time-bin entangled photons[9] at telecom wavelengths.

"During a crossover via a switching mechanism from one 2-body potential to another as might be applied in modeling (chemical) reactions in the vicinity of bond formation, energy violations would occur due to finite step size which determines the trajectory of the particles relative to the potential interactions of the unbonded state by numerical (e.g. Verlet) integration. This problem is overcome by an algorithm which preserves the coordinates of the system for each move, but corrects for energy discrepancies by ensuring both energy and momentum conservation in the dynamics. The algorithm is tested for a hysteresis loop reaction model with an without the implementation of the algorithm. The tests involve checking the rate of energy flow out of the MD simulation box; in the equilibrium state, no net rate of flows within experimental error should be observed. The temperature and pressure of the box should also be invariant within the range of fluctuation of these quantities. It is demonstrated that the algorithm satisfies these criteria. ",0,0
"An encounter-based network is a frequently disconnected wireless ad-hoc network requiring nearby neighbors to store and forward data utilizing mobility and encounters over time. Using traditional approaches such as gateways or firewalls for deterring worm propagation in encounter-based networks is inappropriate. Because this type of network is highly dynamic and has no specific boundary, a distributed counter-worm mechanism is needed. We propose models for the worm interaction approach that relies upon automated beneficial worm generation to alleviate problems of worm propagation in such networks. We study and analyze the impact of key mobile node characteristics including node cooperation, immunization, on-off behavior on the worm propagations and interactions. We validate our proposed model using extensive simulations. We also find that, in addition to immunization, cooperation can reduce the level of worm infection. Furthermore, on-off behavior linearly impacts only timing aspect but not the overall infection. Using realistic mobile network measurements, we find that encounters are non-uniform, the trends are consistent with the model but the magnitudes are drastically different. Immunization seems to be the most effective in such scenarios. These findings provide insight that we hope would aid to develop counter-worm protocols in future encounter-based networks. ",0,0
"We consider the simplest generalizations of the valence bond physics of SU(2) singlets to SU(N) singlets that comprise objects with N sites – these are SU(N) singlet plaquettes with N=3 and N=4 in three spatial dimensions. Specifically, we search for a quantum mechanical liquid of such objects – a resonating singlet valence plaquette phase that generalizes the celebrated resonating valence bond phase for SU(2) spins. We extend the Rokhsar-Kivelson construction of the quantum dimer model to the simplest SU(4) model for valence plaquette dynamics on a cubic lattice. The phase diagram of the resulting quantum plaquette model is analyzed both analytically and numerically. We find that the ground state is solid everywhere, including at the Rokhsar-Kivelson point where the ground state is an equal amplitude sum. By contrast, the equal amplitude sum of SU(3) singlet triangular plaquettes on the face centered cubic lattice is liquid and thus a candidate for describing a resonating single valence plaquette phase, given a suitably defined local Hamiltonian.

"We study the nonlinear evolution of the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the dark matter power spectrum and correlation function using renormalized perturbation theory (RPT). In a previous paper we showed that RPT successfully predicts the damping of acoustic oscillations; here we extend our calculation to the enhancement of power due to mode-coupling. We show that mode-coupling generates additional oscillations that are out of phase with those in the linear spectrum, leading to shifts in the scales of oscillation nodes defined with respect to a smooth spectrum. When Fourier transformed, these out of phase oscillations induce percent-level shifts in the acoustic peak of the two-point correlation function. We present predictions for these shifts as a function of redshift; these should be considered as a robust lower limit to the more realistic case that includes in addition redshift distortions and galaxy bias. We show that these nonlinear effects occur at very large scales, leading to a breakdown of linear theory at scales much larger than commonly thought. We discuss why virialized halo profiles are not responsible for these effects, which can be understood from basic physics of gravitational instability. Our results are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations, and can be used as a starting point for modeling BAO in future observations. To meet this end, we suggest a simple physically motivated model to correct for the shifts caused by mode-coupling. ",0,0

"We present high cadence, high precision multi-band photometry of the young, M1Ve, debris disk star, AU Microscopii. The data were obtained in three continuum filters spanning a wavelength range from 4500Åto 6600Å, plus Hα, over 28 nights in 2005. The lightcurves show intrinsic stellar variability due to starspots with an amplitude in the blue band of 0.051 magnitudes and a period of 4.847 days. In addition, three large flares were detected in the data which all occur near the minimum brightness of the star. We remove the intrinsic stellar variability and combine the lightcurves of all the filters in order to search for transits by possible planetary companions orbiting in the plane of the nearly edge-on debris disk. The combined final lightcurve has a sampling of 0.35 minutes and a standard deviation of 6.8 millimags (mmag). We performed Monte Carlo simulations by adding fake transits to the observed lightcurve and find with 95",0,0
"We present a new technique to compute simultaneously valid confidence intervals for a set of model parameters. We apply our method to the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe's (WMAP) Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data, exploring a seven dimensional space (tau, Omega_DE, Omega_M, omega_DM, omega_B, f_nu, n_s). We find two distinct regions-of-interest: the standard Concordance Model, and a region with large values of omega_DM, omega_B and H_0. This second peak in parameter space can be rejected by applying a constraint (or a prior) on the allowable values of the Hubble constant. Our new technique uses a non-parametric fit to the data, along with a frequentist approach and a smart search algorithm to map out a statistical confidence surface. The result is a confidence “ball”: a set of parameter values that contains the true value with probability at least 1-alpha. Our algorithm performs a role similar to the often used Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which samples from the posterior probability function in order to provide Bayesian credible intervals on the parameters. While the MCMC approach samples densely around a peak in the posterior, our new technique allows cosmologists to perform efficient analyses around any regions of interest: e.g., the peak itself, or, possibly more importantly, the 1-alpha confidence surface.

"Noncritical M-theory in 2+1 dimensions has been defined as a double-scaling limit of a nonrelativistic Fermi liquid on a flat two-dimensional plane. Here we study this noncritical M-theory in the limit of high energies, analogous to the α'→∞limit of string theory. In the related case of two-dimensional Type 0A strings, it has been argued that the conformal α'→∞limit leads to AdS_2 with a propagating fermion whose mass is set by the value of the RR flux. Here we provide evidence that in the high-energy limit, the natural ground state of noncritical M-theory similarly describes the AdS_2×S^1 spacetime, with a massless propagating fermion. We argue that the spacetime effective theory in this background is captured by a topological higher-spin extension of conformal Chern-Simons gravity in 2+1 dimensions, consistently coupled to a massless Dirac field. Intriguingly, the two-dimensional plane populated by the original nonrelativistic fermions is essentially the twistor space associated with the symmetry group of the AdS_2×S^1 spacetime; thus, at least in the high-energy limit, noncritical M-theory can be nonperturbatively described as a 'Fermi liquid on twistor space.'

"To understand the whole set of positive and null data on the Theta+(1530)-production, we suggest the hypothesis that multiquark hadrons are mainly generated from many-quark states, which emerge either as short-term hadron fluctuations, or as hadron remnants in hard processes. This approach allows us to describe both non-observation of the Theta+ in current null experiments and peculiar features of its production in positive experiments. Further, we are able to propose new experiments that might be decisive for the problem of the Theta+ existence. Distributions of the Theta+ in such experiments can give important information both on higher Fock components of conventional hadrons and about structure and hadronization properties of hadron remnants produced in hard processes. We also explain that description of multiquark hadrons may require a modified form of the constituent quark model, with quark masses and couplings being intermediate between their values for the familiar constituent quarks and the current ones.

"Einstein's early calculations of gravitational lensing, contained in a scratch notebook and dated to the spring of 1912, are reexamined. A hitherto unknown letter by Einstein suggests that he entertained the idea of explaining the phenomenon of new stars by gravitational lensing in the fall of 1915 much more seriously than was previously assumed. A reexamination of the relevant calculations by Einstein shows that, indeed, at least some of them most likely date from early October 1915. But in support of earlier historical interpretation of Einstein's notes, it is argued that the appearance of Nova Geminorum 1912 (DN Gem) in March 1912 may, in fact, provide a relevant context and motivation for Einstein's lensing calculations on the occasion of his first meeting with Erwin Freundlich during a visit in Berlin in April 1912. We also comment on the significance of Einstein's consideration of gravitational lensing in the fall of 1915 for the reconstruction of Einstein's final steps in his path towards general relativity.

"A number of recently discovered protein structures incorporate a rather unexpected structural feature: a knot in the polypeptide backbone. These knots are extremely rare, but their occurrence is likely connected to protein function in as yet unexplored fashion. Our analysis of the complete Protein Data Bank reveals several new knots which, along with previously discovered ones, can shed light on such connections. In particular, we identify the most complex knot discovered to date in human ubiquitin hydrolase, and suggest that its entangled topology protects it against unfolding and degradation by the proteasome. Knots in proteins are typically preserved across species and sometimes even across kingdoms. However, we also identify a knot which only appears in some transcarbamylases while being absent in homologous proteins of similar structure. The emergence of the knot is accompanied by a shift in the enzymatic function of the protein. We suggest that the simple insertion of a short DNA fragment into the gene may suffice to turn an unknotted into a knotted structure in this protein. ",0,0
"This paper describes the Wide Field Spectrograph (WiFeS) under construction at the Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics (RSAA) of the Australian National University (ANU) for the ANU 2.3m telescope at the Siding Spring Observatory. WiFeS is a powerful integral field, double-beam, concentric, image-slicing spectrograph designed to deliver excellent thoughput, wavelength stability, spectrophotometric performance and superb image quality along with wide spectral coverage throughout the 320-950 nm wavelength region. It provides a 25x38 arcsec. field with 0.5 arcsec. sampling along each of twenty five 38X1 arcsec slitlets. The output format is optimized to match the 4096x4096 pixel CCD detectors in each of two cameras individually optimized for the blue and the red ends of the spectrum, respectively. A process of 'interleaved nod-and-shuffle' will be applied to permit quantum noise-limited sky subtraction. Using VPH gratings, spectral resolutions of 3000 and 7000 are provided. The full spectral range is covered in a single exposure at R=3000, and in two exposures in the R=7000 mode. The use of transmissive coated optics, VPH gratings and optimized mirror coatings ensures a throughput (including telescope atmosphere and detector) > 30",0,0
"(Abridged) We present numerical hydrodynamical simulations of the formation, evolution and gravitational collapse of isothermal molecular cloud cores. A compressive wave is set up in a constant sub-Jeans density distribution of radius r = 1 pc. As the wave travels through the simulation grid, a shock-bounded spherical shell is formed. The inner shock of this shell reaches and bounces off the center, leaving behind a central core with an initially almost uniform density distribution, surrounded by an envelope consisting of the material in the shock-bounded shell, with a power-law density profile that at late times approaches a logarithmic slope of -2 even in non-collapsing cases. The resulting density structure resembles a quiescent core of radius < 0.1 pc, with a Bonnor-Ebert-like (BE-like) profile, although it has significant dynamical differences: it is initially non-self-gravitating and confined by the ram pressure of the infalling material, and consequently, growing continuously in mass and size. With the appropriate parameters, the core mass eventually reaches an effective Jeans mass, at which time the core begins to collapse. Thus, there is necessarily a time delay between the appearance of the core and the onset of its collapse, but this is not due to the dissipation of its internal turbulence as it is often believed. These results suggest that pre-stellar cores may approximate Bonnor-Ebert structures which are however of variable mass and may or may not experience gravitational collapse, in qualitative agreement with the large observed frequency of cores with BE-like profiles.

"We present an initial analysis of AKARI 18um-selected galaxies using all 9 photometric bands at 2-24um available in the InfraRed Camera (IRC), in order to demonstrate new capabilities of AKARI cosmological surveys. We detected 72 sources at 18um in an area of 50.2 arcmin^2 in the AKARI/IRC monitor field towards the North Ecliptic Pole (NEP). From this sample, 25 galaxies with probable redshifts z>0.5 are selected with a single colour cut (N2-N3>0.1) for a detailed SED analysis with ground-based BVRi'z'JK data. Using an SED radiative transfer model of starbursts covering the wavelength range UV – submm, we derive photometric redshifts from the optical-MIR SEDs of 18um-selected galaxies. From the best-fit SED models, we show that the IRC all-band photometry is capable of tracing the steep rise in flux at the blue side of the PAH 6.2um emission feature. This indicates that the IRC all-band photometry is useful to constrain the redshift of infrared galaxies, specifically for dusty galaxies with a less prominent 4000A break. Also, we find that the flux dip between the PAH 7.7 and 11.2um emission feature is recognizable in the observed SEDs of galaxies at z 1. By using such a colour anomaly due to the PAH and silicate absorption features, unique samples of ULIRGs at z 1, `silicate-break' galaxies, can be constructed from large cosmological surveys of AKARI towards the NEP, i.e. the NEP-Deep and NEP-Wide survey. This pilot study suggests the possibility of detecting many interesting galaxy properties in the NEP-Deep and Wide surveys, such as a systematic difference in SEDs between high- and low-z ULIRGs, and a large variation of the PAH inter-band strength ratio in galaxies at high redshifts.

"Our group recently reproduced the water-assisted growth method, so-called 'super growth', of millimeter-thick single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) forests by using C2H4/ H2/ H2O/ Ar reactant gas and Fe/ Al2O3 catalyst. In this current work, a parametric study was carried out on both reaction and catalyst conditions. Results revealed that a thin Fe catalyst layer (about 0.5 nm) yielded rapid growth of SWNTs only when supported on Al2O3, and that Al2O3 support enhanced the activity of Fe, Co, and Ni catalysts. The growth window for the rapid SWNT growth was narrow, however. Optimum amount of added H2O increased the SWNT growth rate but further addition of H2O degraded both the SWNT growth rate and quality. Addition of H2 was also essential for rapid SWNT growth, but again, further addition decreased both the SWNT growth rate and quality. Because Al2O3 catalyzes hydrocarbon reforming, Al2O3 support possibly enhances the SWNT growth rate by supplying the carbon source to the catalyst nanoparticles. The origin of the narrow window for rapid SWNT growth will also be discussed. ",0,0
"Systematic description of a spin one-half system endowed with magnetic moment or any other two-level system (qubit) interacting with the quantized electromagnetic field is developed. This description exploits a close analogy between a two-level system and the Dirac electron that comes to light when the two-level system is described within the formalism of second quantization in terms of fermionic creation and annihilation operators. The analogy enables one to introduce all the powerful tools of relativistic QED (albeit in a greatly simplified form). The Feynman diagrams and the propagators turn out to be very useful. In particular, the QED concept of the vacuum polarization finds its close counterpart in the photon scattering off a two level-system leading via the linear response theory to the general formulas for the atomic polarizability and the dynamic single spin susceptibility. To illustrate the usefulness of these methods, we calculate the polarizability and susceptibility up to the fourth order of perturbation theory. These ab initio calculations resolve some ambiguities concerning the sign prescription and the optical damping that arise in the phenomenological treatment. We also show that the methods used to study two-level systems (qubits) can be extended to many-level systems (qudits). As an example, we describe the interaction with the quantized electromagnetic field of an atom with four relevant states: one S state and three degenerate P states. ",0,0
"The notion of innocent strategy was introduced by Hyland and Ong in order to capture the interactive behaviour of lambda-terms and PCF programs. An innocent strategy is defined as an alternating strategy with partial memory, in which the strategy plays according to its view. Extending the definition to non-alternating strategies is problematic, because the traditional definition of views is based on the hypothesis that Opponent and Proponent alternate during the interaction. Here, we take advantage of the diagrammatic reformulation of alternating innocence in asynchronous games, in order to provide a tentative definition of innocence in non-alternating games. The task is interesting, and far from easy. It requires the combination of true concurrency and game semantics in a clean and organic way, clarifying the relationship between asynchronous games and concurrent games in the sense of Abramsky and Melliès. It also requires an interactive reformulation of the usual acyclicity criterion of linear logic, as well as a directed variant, as a scheduling criterion. ",0,0
"As well known, the b-boundaries of the closed Friedman world model and of Schwarzschild solution consist of a single point. We study this phenomenon in a broader context of differential and structured spaces. We show that it is an equivalence relation ρ, defined on the Cauchy completed total space E̅ of the frame bundle over a given space-time, that is responsible for this pathology. A singularity is called malicious if the equivalence class [p_0] related to the singularity remains in close contact with all other equivalence classes, i.e., if p_0 ∈cl[p] for every p ∈ E. We formulate conditions for which such a situation occurs. The differential structure of any space-time with malicious singularities consists only of constant functions which means that, from the topological point of view, everything collapses to a single point. It was noncommutative geometry that was especially devised to deal with such situations. A noncommutative algebra on E̅, which turns out to be a von Neumann algebra of random operators, allows us to study probabilistic properties (in a generalized sense) of malicious singularities. Our main result is that, in the noncommutative regime, even the strongest singularities are probabilistically irrelevant. ",0,0
"Let ℰ_f:y^2=x^3+f(t)x, where f∈[t]∖, and let us assume that degf≤ 4. In this paper we prove that if degf≤ 3, then there exists a rational base change t↦ϕ(t) such that on the surface E_f∘ϕ there is a non-torsion section. A similar theorem is valid in case when degf=4 and there exists t_0∈ such that infinitely many rational points lie on the curve E_t_0:y^2=x^3+f(t_0)x. In particular, we prove that if degf=4 and f is not an even polynomial, then there is a rational point on E_f. Next, we consider a surface E^g:y^2=x^3+g(t), where g∈[t] is a monic polynomial of degree six. We prove that if the polynomial g is not even, there is a rational base change t↦ψ(t) such that on the surface E^g∘ψ there is a non-torsion section. Furthermore, if there exists t_0∈ such that on the curve E^t_0:y^2=x^3+g(t_0) there are infinitely many rational points, then the set of these t_0 is infinite.

"Multifrequency VLBA observations of the final group of ten objects in a sample of FIRST-based compact steep spectrum (CSS) sources are presented. The sample was selected to investigate whether objects of this kind could be relics of radio-loud AGNs switched off at very early stages of their evolution or possibly to indicate intermittent activity. Initial observations were made using MERLIN at 5 GHz. The sources have now been observed with the VLBA at 1.7, 5 and 8.4 GHz in a snapshot mode with phase-referencing. The resulting maps are presented along with unpublished 8.4-GHz VLA images of five sources. Some of the sources discussed here show a complex radio morphology and therefore a complicated past that, in some cases, might indicate intermittent activity. One of the sources studied - 1045+352 - is known as a powerful radio and infrared-luminous broad absorption line (BAL) quasar. It is a young CSS object whose asymmetric two-sided morphology on a scale of several hundred parsecs, extending in two different directions, may suggest intermittent activity. The young age and compact structure of 1045+352 is consistent with the evolution scenario of BAL quasars. It has also been confirmed that the submillimetre flux of 1045+352 can be seriously contaminated by synchrotron emission. ",0,0
"We use high-resolution hydrodynamic re-simulations to investigate the properties of the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect from galaxy clusters. We compare results obtained using different physical models for the intracluster medium (ICM), and show how they modify the SZ emission in terms of cluster profiles and scaling relations. We also produce realistic mock observations to verify whether the results from hydrodynamic simulations can be confirmed. We find that SZ profiles depend marginally on the modelled physical processes, while they exhibit a strong dependence on cluster mass. The central and total SZ emission strongly correlate with the cluster X-ray luminosity and temperature. The logarithmic slopes of these scaling relations differ from the self-similar predictions by less than 0.2; the normalization of the relations is lower for simulations including radiative cooling. The observational test suggests that SZ cluster profiles are unlikely to be able to probe the ICM physics. The total SZ decrement appears to be an observable much more robust than the central intensity, and we suggest using the former to investigate scaling relations. ",0,0
"Aims: We describe a fast, robust and automatic detection algorithm, TRUFAS, and apply it to data that are being expected from the CoRoT mission. Methods: The procedure proposed for the detection of planetary transits in light curves works in two steps: 1) a continuous wavelet transformation of the detrended light curve with posterior selection of the optimum scale for transit detection, and 2) a period search in that selected wavelet transformation. The detrending of the light curves are based on Fourier filtering or a discrete wavelet transformation. TRUFAS requires the presence of at least 3 transit events in the data. Results: The proposed algorithm is shown to identify reliably and quickly the transits that had been included in a standard set of 999 light curves that simulate CoRoT data. Variations in the pre-processing of the light curves and in the selection of the scale of the wavelet transform have only little effect on TRUFAS' results. Conclusions: TRUFAS is a robust and quick transit detection algorithm, especially well suited for the analysis of very large volumes of data from space or ground-based experiments, with long enough durations for the target-planets to produce multiple transit events.

"LS I +61 303 is a puzzling Be/X-ray binary with variable gamma-ray emission at up TeV energies. The nature of the compact object and the origin of the high-energy emission are unclear. One family of models invokes particle acceleration in shocks from the collision between the B-star wind and a relativistic pulsar wind, while another centers on a relativistic jet powered by accretion. Recent high-resolution radio observations showing a putative 'cometary tail' pointing away from the Be star near periastron have been cited as support for the pulsar-wind model. We wish here to carry out a quantitative assessment of these competing models for this extraordinary source. We apply a 3D SPH code for dynamical simulations of both the pulsar-wind-interaction and accretion-jet models. The former yields a description of the shape of the wind-wind interaction surface. The latter provides an estimation of the accretion rate. The results allow critical evaluation of how the two distinct models confront the data in various wavebands under a range of conditions. When one accounts for the 3D dynamical wind interaction under realistic constraints for the relative strength of the B-star and pulsar winds, the resulting form of the interaction front does not match the putative 'cometary tail' claimed from radio observations. On the other hand, dynamical simulations of the accretion-jet model indicate that the orbital phase variation of accretion power includes a secondary broad peak well away from periastron, thus providing a plausible way to explain the observed TeV gamma ray emission toward apastron. We conclude that the colliding-wind model is not clearly established for LS I +61 303, while the accretion-jet model can reproduce many key characteristics of the observed TeV gamma-ray emission.

"We measured fragmentation cross sections produced using the primary beam of ^86Kr at 64 MeV/nucleon on ^9Be and ^181Ta targets. The cross sections were obtained by integrating the momentum distributions of isotopes with 25<Z<36 measured using the RIPS fragment separator at RIKEN. The cross-section ratios obtained with the ^181Ta and ^9Be targets depend on the fragment masses, contrary to the simple geometrical models. We compared the extracted cross sections to EPAX; an empirical parameterization of fragmentation cross sections. Predictions from current EPAX parameterization severely overestimate the production cross sections of very neutron-rich isotopes. Attempts to obtain another set of EPAX parameters specific to the reaction studied here, to extrapolate the neutron-rich nuclei more accurately have not been very successful, suggesting that accurate predictions of production cross sections of nuclei far from the valley of stability require information of nuclear properties which are not present in EPAX.

The proofs rely partially on the multifractal formalism for Stern-Brocot intervals and give non-trivial applications of this formalism. ",0,0
"We present detailed results from performing general relativistic (GR) simulations of stellar core collapse to a proto-neutron star, using a microphysical equation of state (EoS) as well as an approximate description of deleptonization during the collapse phase. We show that for a wide variety of rotation rates and profiles the gravitational wave (GW) burst signals from the core bounce are of a generic type, already known as Type I in the literature. In addition, for most models the characteristic frequency of the GW burst signal lies in a narrow range around approximately 718 Hz. In our systematic study, using both GR and Newtonian gravity, we identify, individually quantify, and discuss in detail the micro- and macrophysical mechanisms leading to this result, i.e. the effects of rotation, the EoS, and deleptonization. We also discuss the detectability prospects of such GW burst signals by GW detectors, and infer that such a generic type of signal templates will likely facilitate a more efficient search in current and future detectors of both interferometric and resonant type.

"One of the most notorious non-Fermi liquid properties of both archetypal heavy-fermion systems [1-4] and the high-Tc copper oxide superconductors [5] is an electrical resistivity that evolves linearly with temperature, T. In the heavy-fermion superconductor CeCoIn5 [5], this linear behaviour was one of the first indications of the presence of a zero-temperature instability, or quantum critical point. Here, we report the observation of a unique control parameter of T-linear scattering in CeCoIn5, found through systematic chemical substitutions of both magnetic and non-magnetic rare-earth, R, ions into the Ce sub-lattice. We find that the evolution of inelastic scattering in Ce1-xRxCoIn5 is strongly dependent on the f-electron configuration of the R ion, whereas two other key properties – Cooper-pair breaking and Kondo-lattice coherence – are not. Thus, T-linear resistivity in CeCoIn5 is intimately related to the nature of incoherent scattering centers in the Kondo lattice, which provides insight into the anomalous scattering rate synonymous with quantum criticality [7].

"The structure and mechanical properties of a simple two-dimensional model of a cohesive powder are investigated by molecular dynamics simulations. Micromechanical ingredients involve elasticity, friction, a short range attraction and, possibly, rolling resistance (RR) in contacts. The microstructure of the cohesive packing varies according to the assembling procedure, from rather densely packed if isolated particles are directly compressed to much looser if the formation of large aggregates is allowed prior to compression. A crucial parameter is the ratio P*= Pa/F0 of applied pressure P, acting on grains of diameter a, to maximum tensile contact force F0. At low P* the final structure depends on the level of velocity fluctuations at the early stages of cluster aggregation. With RR the coordination number approaches 2 in the limit of low initial velocities or large rolling friction. The force network generally comprises small hyperstatic clusters with forces of the order of F0, joined by nearly unstressed, barely rigid arms. As P* grows, it quickly rearranges into force chain-like patterns. Density correlations witness a fractal structure, with dimension Df, up to some density-dependent blob size. WIth RR Df coincides with the ballistic aggregation result, despite a possibly different connectivity. Possible effects of some parameters on material strength are evoked. ",0,0
"This paper investigates the many-to-one throughput capacity (and by symmetry, one-to-many throughput capacity) of IEEE 802.11 multi-hop networks. It has generally been assumed in prior studies that the many-to-one throughput capacity is upper-bounded by the link capacity L. Throughput capacity L is not achievable under 802.11. This paper introduces the notion of 'canonical networks', which is a class of regularly-structured networks whose capacities can be analyzed more easily than unstructured networks. We show that the throughput capacity of canonical networks under 802.11 has an analytical upper bound of 3L/4 when the source nodes are two or more hops away from the sink; and simulated throughputs of 0.690L (0.740L) when the source nodes are many hops away. We conjecture that 3L/4 is also the upper bound for general networks. When all links have equal length, 2L/3 can be shown to be the upper bound for general networks. Our simulations show that 802.11 networks with random topologies operated with AODV routing can only achieve throughputs far below the upper bounds. Fortunately, by properly selecting routes near the gateway (or by properly positioning the relay nodes leading to the gateway) to fashion after the structure of canonical networks, the throughput can be improved significantly by more than 150",0,0
"A comparison of the 2MASS flux dipole to the CMB dipole can serve as a method to constrain a combination of the cosmological parameter Omega_m and the luminosity bias of the 2MASS survey. For this constraint to be as tight as possible, it is necessary to maximize the correlation between the two dipoles. This can be achieved by optimizing the survey window through which the flux dipole is measured. Here we explicitly construct such a window for the 2MASS survey. The optimization in essence reduces to excluding from the calculation of the flux dipole galaxies brighter than some limiting magnitude K_min of the near-infrared K_s band. This exclusion mitigates nonlinear effects and shot noise from small scales, which decorrelate the 2MASS dipole from the CMB dipole. Under the assumption of negligible shot noise we find that the optimal value of K_min is about five. Inclusion of shot noise shifts the optimal K_min to larger values. We present an analytical formula for shot noise for the 2MASS flux dipole, to be used in follow-up work with 2MASS data.The misalignment angle between the two dipoles is a sensitive measure of their correlation: the higher the correlation, the smaller the expectation value of the angle. A minimum of the misalignment is thus a sign of the optimal gravity window. We model analytically the distribution function for the misalignment angle and show that the misalignment estimated by Maller et al. is consistent with the assumed underlying model (though it is greater than the expectation value). We predict with about 90",0,0
"This is a sequel to [Ca01]=math.AG/0110051. We define the bimeromorphic category of geometric orbifolds. These interpolate between (compact Kähler) manifolds and such manifolds with logarithmic structure. These geometric orbifolds are considered from the point of view of their geometry, and thus equipped with the usual invariants of varieties: morphisms and bimeromorphic maps, differential forms, fundamental groups and universal covers, fields of definition and rational points. The most elementary properties, directly adapted from the case of varieties without orbifold structure, are established here. The arguments of [Ca01] can then be directly adapted to extend the main structure results to this orbifold category. We hope to come back to deeper aspects later. The motivation is that the natural frame for the theory of classification of compact Kähler (and complex projective) manifolds includes at least the category of orbifolds, as shown in [Ca01] by the fonctorial decomposition of special manifolds as tower of orbifolds with either κ_+=-∞ or κ=0, and also, seemingly, by the minimal model program, in which most proofs work only after the adjunction of a 'boundary'.Also, fibrations enjoy in the bimeromorphic category of geometric orbifolds extension properties not satisfied in the category of varieties without orbifold structure, permitting to express invariants of the total space from those of the generic fibre and of the base. For example, the natural sequence of fundamental groups is exact there; also the total space is special if so are the generic fibre and the base. This makes this category suitable to lift properties from orbifolds having either κ_+=-∞ or κ=0 to those which are special. ",0,0
"As decentralized computing scenarios get ever more popular, unstructured topologies are natural candidates to consider running mix networks upon. We consider mix network topologies where mixes are placed on the nodes of an unstructured network, such as social networks and scale-free random networks.

We consider a mix of directed and undirected network models, as well as one real world case study – the LiveJournal friendship network topology. Our analysis indicates that mix-networks based on scale-free and small-world topologies have, firstly, mix-route lengths that are roughly comparable to those in expander graphs; second, that compromise of the most central nodes has little effect on anonymization properties, and third, batch sizes required for warding off intersection attacks need to be an order of magnitude higher in unstructured networks in comparison with expander graph topologies.

"SDSS J080531.84+481233.0 is a peculiar L-type dwarf that exhibits unusually blue near-infrared and mid-infrared colors and divergent optical (L4) and near-infrared (L9.5) spectral classifications. These peculiar spectral traits have been variously attributed to condensate cloud effects or subsolar metallicity. Here I present an improved near-infrared spectrum of this source which further demonstrates the presence of weak CH4 absorption at 1.6 micron but no corresponding band at 2.2 micron. It is shown that these features can be collectively reproduced by the combined light spectrum of a binary with L4.5 and T5 components, as deduced by spectral template matching. Thus, SDSS J080531.84+481233.0 appears to be a new low-mass binary straddling the L dwarf/T dwarf transition, an evolutionary phase for brown dwarfs that remains poorly understood by current theoretical models. The case of SDSS J080531.84+481233.0 further illustrates how a select range of L dwarf/T dwarf binaries could be identified and characterized without the need for high angular resolution imaging or radial velocity monitoring, potentially alleviating some of the detection biases and limitations inherent to such techniques.

We first show how system-size stochastic resonance arises naturally in this framework, and then how the phenomenon of array-enhanced stochastic resonance can be further enhanced by letting the diffusion coefficient depend on the field. A yet less trivial generalization is exemplified by a stylized version of the FitzHugh-Nagumo system, a paradigm of the activator-inhibitor class. After discussing for this system the second aspect enumerated above, we derive from it -through an adiabatic-like elimination of the inhibitor field- an effective scalar model that includes a nonlocal contribution. Studying the role played by the range of the nonlocal kernel and its effect on stochastic resonance, we find an optimal range that maximizes the system's response. ",0,0
"We have compiled the largest sample of multiwavelength spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of Broad Absorption Line (BAL) quasars to date, from the radio to the X-ray. We present new Spitzer MIPS (24, 70, and 160 micron) observations of 38 BAL quasars in addition to data from the literature and public archives. In general, the mid-infrared properties of BAL quasars are consistent with those of non-BAL quasars of comparable luminosity. In particular, the optical-to-mid-infrared luminosity ratios of the two populations are indistinguishable. We also measure or place upper limits on the contribution of star formation to the far-infrared power. Of 22 (57",0,0
"We report an Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) study on thick multi lamellar stacks of approx. 10 mum thickness (about 1500 stacked membranes) of DMPC (1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phoshatidylcholine) deposited on silicon wafers. These thick stacks could be stabilized for measurements under excess water or solution. From force curves we determine the compressional modulus B and the rupture force F_r of the bilayers in the gel (ripple), the fluid phase and in the range of critical swelling close to the main transition. AFM allows to measure the compressional modulus of stacked membrane systems and values for B compare well to values reported in the literature. We observe pronounced ripples on the top layer in the Pbeta' (ripple) phase and find an increasing ripple period Lambda_r when approaching the temperature of the main phase transition into the fluid Lalpha phase at about 24 C. Metastable ripples with 2Lambda_r are observed. Lambda_r also increases with increasing osmotic pressure, i.e., for different concentrations of polyethylene glycol (PEG). ",0,0
"A real-space quantum transport simulator for carbon nanoribbon (CNR) MOSFETs has been developed. Using this simulator, the performance of carbon nanoribbon (CNR) MOSFETs is examined in the ballistic limit. The impact of quantum effects on device performance of CNR MOSFETs is also studied. We found that 2D semi-infinite graphene contacts provide metal-induced-gap-states (MIGS) in the CNR channel. These states would provide quantum tunneling in the short channel device and cause Fermi level pining. These effects cause device performance degradation both on the ON-state and the OFF-state. Pure 1D devices (infinite contacts), however, show no MIGS. Quantum tunneling effects are still playing an important role in the device characteristics. Conduction due to band-to-band tunneling is accurately captured in our simulations. It is important in these devices, and found to dominate the off-state current. Based on our simulations, both a 1.4nm wide and a 1.8nm wide CNR with channel length of 12.5nm can outperform ultra scaled Si devices in terms of drive current capabilities and electrostatic control. Although subthreshold slopes in the forward-bias conduction are better than in Si transistors, tunneling currents are important and prevent the achievement of the theoretical limit of 60mV/dec. ",0,0
"This paper details the use of the IT Infrastructure Library Framework (ITIL) for optimising process workflows in the IT Service Centre of Harz University in Wernigerode, Germany, exemplified by the Release Management Process. It is described, how, during the course of a special ITIL project, the As-Is-Status of the various original processes was documented as part of the process life cycle and then transformed in the To-Be-Status, according to the ITIL Best Practice Framework. It is also shown, how the ITIL framework fits into the four-layered-process model, that could be derived from interviews with the universities IT support staff, and how the various modified processes interconnect with each other to form a value chain. The paper highlights the final results of the project and gives an outlook on the future use of ITIL as a business modelling tool in the IT Service Centre of Harz University. It is currently being considered, whether the process model developed during the project could be used as a reference model for other university IT centres. ",0,0
"A study of the p d → p d η reaction in the energy range where the recent data from Uppsala are available, is done in the two-step model of η production including the final state interaction. The η -d final state interaction is incorporated through the solution of the Lippmann Schwinger equation using an elastic scattering matrix element, T_η d →η d, which is required to be half off-shell. It is written in a factorized form, with an off-shell form factor multiplying an on-shell part given by an effective range expansion up to the fourth power in momentum. The parameters of this expansion have been taken from an existing recent relativistic Faddeev equation solution for the η NN system corresponding to different η-N scattering amplitudes. Calculations have also been done using few body equations within a finite rank approximation (FRA) to generate T_η d →η d. The p-d final state interaction is included in the spirit of the Watson-Migdal prescription by multiplying the matrix element by the inverse of the Jost function. The η-d interaction is found to be dominant in the region of small invariant η -d mass, M_η d. The p-d interaction enhances the cross section in the whole region of M_η d, but is larger for large M_η d. We find nearly isotropic angular distributions of the proton and the deuteron in the final state. All the above observations are in agreement with data. The production mechanism for the entire range of the existing data on the p d → p d η reaction seems to be dominated by the two-step model of η production. ",0,0
"We study the boundedness problem for maximal operatorsassociated to smooth hypersurfaces S in 3-dimensional Euclidean space. For p>2, we prove that if no affine tangent plane to S passes through the origin and S is analytic, then the associated maximal operator is bounded on L^p(^3) if and only if p>h(S), where h(S) denotes the so-called height of the surface S. For non-analytic finite type S we obtain the same statement with the exception of the exponent p=h(S). Our notion of height h(S) is closely related to A. N. Varchenko's notion of height h(ϕ) for functions ϕ such that S can be locally represented as the graph of ϕ after a rotation of coordinates.Several consequences of this result are discussed. In particular we verify a conjecture by E.M. Stein and its generalization by A. Iosevich and E. Sawyer on the connection between the decay rate of the Fourier transform of the surface measure on S and the L^p-boundedness of the associated maximal operator , and a conjecture by Iosevich and Sawyer which relates the L^p-boundedness ofto an integrability condition on S for the distance function to tangential hyperplanes, in dimension three.In particular, we also give ess. sharp uniform estimates for the Fourier transform of the surface measure on S, thus extending a result by V.N. Karpushkin from the analytic to the smooth setting and implicitly verifying a conjecture by V.I. Arnol'd in our context. ",0,0
A first principles analysis of order-disorder transition in alloys shows that ordering energy is a function of temperature due to thermal vibrations. The inter-nuclear potential energy term converges if zero point vibrations are incorporated and this method can replace the Ewald sum method. Core energy contributions to the ordering energy are stored exclusively in superlattice lines. The effect of electron-phonon interactions on ordering energy is of the same order of magnitude as ordering energy near transition temperatures and cannot be ignored. Ising model and variants are incorrect in explaining alloy phase transitions as they ignore the role of electron-phonon interactions without justification. A theoretical formalism that incorporates the Debye-Waller Factor component of electron-phonon interactions in electronic structure calculations already exists and must be adopted when modeling temperature dependent phenomena. It is suggested that DWF correction will account substantially for the discrepancy between experimental and theoretical ordering energy in Ni3V. Thermal vibrations alter magnetic ordering energy at finite temperatures. The role of electron-phonon interactions in alloy and magnetic phase transitions cannot be ignored and must be incorporated in all models. This will also ensure consistency with x-ray and electron diffraction (alloy transitions) and neutron diffraction (magnetic transitions) results. An isotope effect is predicted for (magnetic) phase transitions if the transition temperature is below Debye temperature. Recent observations of an isotope effect in magnetic phase transitions confirm our above conclusions and imply that the role of electron-phonon interactions must be incorporated in all theories and models of magnetism to avoid contradictions. ,0,0
"We report the first scattered light detection of a dusty debris disk surrounding the F2V star HD 15115 using the Hubble Space Telescope in the optical, and Keck adaptive optics in the near-infrared. The most remarkable property of the HD 15115 disk relative to other debris disks is its extreme length asymmetry. The east side of the disk is detected to315 AU radius, whereas the west side of the disk has radius >550 AU. We find a blue optical to near-infrared scattered light color relative to the star that indicates grain scattering properties similar to the AU Mic debris disk. The existence of a large debris disk surrounding HD 15115 adds further evidence for membership in the Beta Pic moving group, which was previously argued based on kinematics alone. Here we hypothesize that the extreme disk asymmetry is due to dynamical perturbations from HIP 12545, an M star 0.5 degrees (0.38 pc) east of HD 15115 that shares a common proper motion vector, heliocentric distance, galactic space velocity, and age.

"We present Spitzer observations of the dark globule CB190 (L771). We observe a roughly circular 24 micron shadow with a 70 arcsec radius. The extinction profile of this shadow matches the profile derived from 2MASS photometry at the outer edges of the globule and reaches a maximum of32 visual magnitudes at the center. The corresponding mass of CB190 is10 Msun. Our 12CO and 13CO J = 2-1 data over a 10 arcmin X 10 arcmin region centered on the shadow show a temperature10 K. The thermal continuum indicates a similar temperature for the dust. The molecular data also show evidence of freezeout onto dust grains. We estimate a distance to CB190 of 400 pc using the spectroscopic parallax of a star associated with the globule. Bonnor-Ebert fits to the density profile, in conjunction with this distance, yield xi_max = 7.2, indicating that CB190 may be unstable. The high temperature (56 K) of the best fit Bonnor-Ebert model is in contradiction with the CO and thermal continuum data, leading to the conclusion that the thermal pressure is not enough to prevent free-fall collapse. We also find that the turbulence in the cloud is inadequate to support it. However, the cloud may be supported by the magnetic field, if this field is at the average level for dark globules. Since the magnetic field will eventually leak out through ambipolar diffusion, it is likely that CB190 is collapsing or in a late pre-collapse stage. ",0,0
"B→ϕ K^* () is three separate decays, one for each polarization of the final-state vector mesons (one longitudinal, two transverse). It is observed that the fraction of transverse decays, , and the fraction of longitudinal decays, , are roughly equal: ≃ 1, in opposition to the naive expectation that ≪. If one requires a single explanation of all polarization puzzles, two possibilities remain within the standard model: penguin annihilation and rescattering. In this paper we examine the predictions of these two explanations forindecays. In B →ρρ decays, only →ρ^0ρ^0 can possibly exhibit a large . In B decays related by U-spin, we find two promising possibilities: (i) B^+ → K^*0ρ^+ () and B^+ →^*0 K^*+ () and (ii) → K^*0^*0 () and →^*0 K^*0 (). The measurement ofin these pairs of decays will allow us to test penguin annihilation and rescattering. Finally, it is possible to distinguish penguin annihilation from rescattering by performing a time-dependent angular analysis of →^*0 K^*0. ",0,0
"The extraction of the weak phase α from B→ππ decays has been controversial from a statistical point of view, as the frequentist vs. bayesian confrontation shows. We analyse several relevant questions which have not deserved full attention and pervade the extraction of α. Reparametrization Invariance proves appropriate to understand those issues. We show that some Standard Model inspired parametrizations can be senseless or inadequate if they go beyond the minimal Gronau and London assumptions: the single weak phase α just in the Δ I=3/2 amplitudes, the isospin relations and experimental data. Beside those analyses, we extract α through the use of several adequate parametrizations, showing that there is no relevant discrepancy between frequentist and bayesian results. The most relevant information, in terms of α, is the exclusion of values around α∼π/4; this result is valid in the presence of arbitrary New Physics contributions to the Δ I=1/2 piece. ",0,0
"We present the results of realistic N-body modelling of massive star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds, aimed at investigating a dynamical origin for the radius-age trend observed in these systems. We find that stellar-mass black holes, formed in the supernova explosions of the most massive cluster stars, can constitute a dynamically important population. If a significant number of black holes are retained (here we assume complete retention), these objects rapidly form a dense core where interactions are common, resulting in the scattering of black holes into the cluster halo, and the ejection of black holes from the cluster. These two processes heat the stellar component, resulting in prolonged core expansion of a magnitude matching the observations. Significant core evolution is also observed in Magellanic Cloud clusters at early times. We find that this does not result from the action of black holes, but can be reproduced by the effects of mass-loss due to rapid stellar evolution in a primordially mass segregated cluster. ",0,0
"A game-theoretic framework is used to study the effect of constellation size on the energy efficiency of wireless networks for M-QAM modulation. A non-cooperative game is proposed in which each user seeks to choose its transmit power (and possibly transmit symbol rate) as well as the constellation size in order to maximize its own utility while satisfying its delay quality-of-service (QoS) constraint. The utility function used here measures the number of reliable bits transmitted per joule of energy consumed, and is particularly suitable for energy-constrained networks. The best-response strategies and Nash equilibrium solution for the proposed game are derived. It is shown that in order to maximize its utility (in bits per joule), a user must choose the lowest constellation size that can accommodate the user's delay constraint. This strategy is different from one that would maximize spectral efficiency. Using this framework, the tradeoffs among energy efficiency, delay, throughput and constellation size are also studied and quantified. In addition, the effect of trellis-coded modulation on energy efficiency is discussed. ",0,0
"We address the inverse problem of cosmic large-scale structure reconstruction from a Bayesian perspective. For a linear data model, a number of known and novel reconstruction schemes, which differ in terms of the underlying signal prior, data likelihood, and numerical inverse extra-regularization schemes are derived and classified. The Bayesian methodology presented in this paper tries to unify and extend the following methods: Wiener-filtering, Tikhonov regularization, Ridge regression, Maximum Entropy, and inverse regularization techniques. The inverse techniques considered here are the asymptotic regularization, the Jacobi, Steepest Descent, Newton-Raphson, Landweber-Fridman, and both linear and non-linear Krylov methods based on Fletcher-Reeves, Polak-Ribiere, and Hestenes-Stiefel Conjugate Gradients. The structures of the up-to-date highest-performing algorithms are presented, based on an operator scheme, which permits one to exploit the power of fast Fourier transforms. Using such an implementation of the generalized Wiener-filter in the novel ARGO-software package, the different numerical schemes are benchmarked with 1-, 2-, and 3-dimensional problems including structured white and Poissonian noise, data windowing and blurring effects. A novel numerical Krylov scheme is shown to be superior in terms of performance and fidelity. These fast inverse methods ultimately will enable the application of sampling techniques to explore complex joint posterior distributions. We outline how the space of the dark-matter density field, the peculiar velocity field, and the power spectrum can jointly be investigated by a Gibbs-sampling process. Such a method can be applied for the redshift distortions correction of the observed galaxies and for time-reversal reconstructions of the initial density field. ",0,0
"The newly discovered brown-dwarf eclipsing binary 2MASS J05352184-0546085 provides a unique laboratory for testing the predictions of theoretical models of brown-dwarf formation and evolution. The finding that the lower-mass brown dwarf in this system is hotter than its higher-mass companion represents a challenge to brown-dwarf evolutionary models, none of which predict this behavior. Here we present updated determinations of the basic physical properties of 2M0535-05, bolstering the surprising reversal of temperatures with mass in this system. We compare these measurements with widely used brown-dwarf evolutionary tracks, and find that the temperature reversal can be explained by some models if the components of 2M0535-05 are mildly non-coeval, possibly consistent with dynamical simulations of brown-dwarf formation. Alternatively, a strong magnetic field on the higher-mass brown dwarf might explain its anomalously low surface temperature, consistent with emerging evidence that convection is suppressed in magnetically active, low-mass stars. Finally, we discuss future observational and theoretical work needed to further characterize and understand this benchmark system. ",0,0
"We show using computer simulations and mean field theory that a system of particles in two dimensions, when confined laterally by a pair of parallel hard walls within a quasi one dimensional channel, possesses several anomalous structural and mechanical properties not observed in the bulk. Depending on the density ρ and the distance between the walls L_y, the system shows structural characteristics analogous to a weakly modulated liquid, a strongly modulated smectic, a triangular solid or a buckled phase. At fixed ρ, a change in L_y leads to many reentrant discontinuous transitions involving changes in the number of layers parallel to the confining walls depending crucially on the commensurability of inter-layer spacing with L_y. The solid shows resistance to elongation but not to shear. When strained beyond the elastic limit it fails undergoing plastic deformation but surprisingly, as the strain is reversed, the material recovers completely and returns to its original undeformed state. We obtain the phase diagram from mean field theory and finite size simulations and discuss the effect of fluctuations. ",0,0
"We present a five (u*,g',r',i',z') band optical photometry catalog of the sources in the North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) region based on deep observations made with MegaCam at CFHT. The source catalog covers about 2 square degree area centered at the NEP and reaches depths of about 26 mag for u*, g', r' bands, about 25 mag for i' band, and about 24 mag for z' band (4 sigma detection over an 1 arcsec aperture). The total number of cataloged sources brighter than r'= 23 mag is about 56,000 including both point sources and extended sources. From the investigation of photometric properties using the color-magnitude diagrams and color-color diagrams, we have found that the colors of extended sources are mostly (u*-r') < 3.0 and (g'-z') > 0.5. This can be used to separate the extended sources from the point sources reliably, even for the faint source domain where typical morphological classification schemes hardly work efficiently. We have derived an empirical color-redshift relation of the red sequence galaxies using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data. By applying this relation to our photometry catalog and searching for any spatial overdensities, we have found two galaxy clusters and one nearby galaxy group. ",0,0
"Product probability property, known in the literature as statistical independence, is examined first. Then generalized entropies are introduced, all of which give generalizations to Shannon entropy. It is shown that the nature of the recursivity postulate automatically determines the logarithmic functional form for Shannon entropy. Due to the logarithmic nature, Shannon entropy naturally gives rise to additivity, when applied to situations having product probability property. It is argued that the natural process is non-additivity, important, for example, in statistical mechanics, even in product probability property situations and additivity can hold due to the involvement of a recursivity postulate leading to a logarithmic function. Generalizations, including Mathai's generalized entropy are introduced and some of the properties are examined. Situations are examined where Mathai's entropy leads to pathway models, exponential and power law behavior and related differential equations. Connection of Mathai's entropy to Kerridge's measure of 'inaccuracy' is also explored. ",0,0
"A path-integral for the t-J model in two dimensions is constructed based on Dirac quantization, with an action found originally by Wiegmann (Phys. Rev. Lett. 60, 821 (1988); Nucl. Phys. B323, 311 (1989)). Concentrating on the low doping limit, we assume short range antiferromagnetic order of the spin degrees of freedom. Going over to a local spin quantization axis of the dopant fermions, that follows the spin degree of freedom, staggered CP^1 fields result and the constraint against double occupancy can be resolved. The staggered CP^1 fields are split into slow and fast modes, such that after a gradient expansion, and after integrating out the fast modes and the dopant fermions, a CP^1 field-theory with a massive gauge field is obtained that describes generically incommensurate coplanar magnetic structures, as discussed previously in the context of frustrated quantum antiferromagnets. Hence, the possibility of deconfined spinons is opened by doping a colinear antiferromagnet. ",0,0
"If the cold dark matter consists of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), anticipated measurements of the WIMP properties at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the International Linear Collider (ILC) will provide an unprecedented experimental probe of cosmology at temperatures of order 1 GeV. It is worth emphasizing that the expected outcome of these tests may or may not be consistent with the picture of standard cosmology. For example, in kination-dominated quintessence models of dark energy, the dark matter relic abundance can be significantly enhanced compared to that obtained from freeze out in a radiation-dominated universe. Collider measurements then will simultaneously probe both dark matter and dark energy. In this article, we investigate the precision to which the LHC and ILC can determine the dark matter and dark energy parameters under those circumstances. We use an illustrative set of four benchmark points in minimal supergravity in analogy with the four LCC benchmark points. The precision achievable together at the LHC and ILC is sufficient to discover kination-dominated quintessence, under the assumption that the WIMPs are the only dark matter component. The LHC and ILC can thus play important roles as alternative probes of both dark matter and dark energy. ",0,0
"We provide the perturbative and non-perturbative arguments showing that theories with large number of species of the quantum fields, imply an inevitable hierarchy between the masses of the species and the Planck scale, shedding a different light on the hierarchy problem. In particular, using the black hole physics, we prove that any consistent theory that includes N number of the Z_2-conserved species of the quantum fields of mass Λ, puts a lower bound on the Planck mass, which in large N limit is given by NΛ^2. An useful byproduct of this proof is that any exactly conserved quantum charge, not associated with a long-range classical field, must be defined maximum modulo N, bounded by the the ratio of the Planck to the unit charge masses squared. For example, a continuous global U(1) `baryon number' symmetry, must be explicitly broken by gravity, at least down to a Z_N subgroup, with N bounded by the ratio of the Planck to baryon masses squared. The same constraint applies to any discrete gauge symmetry, as well as to other quantum-mechanically detectable black hole charges that are associated with the massive quantum hair of the black hole. We show that the gravitationally-coupled N-species sector that solves the gauge hirearchy problem, should be probed by LHC. ",0,0
"We present new imaging and spectroscopic observations of the fields of five QSOs with very strong intervening CaII absorption systems at redshifts z<0.5 selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Recent studies of these very rare absorbers indicate that they may be related to damped Lyman alpha systems (DLAs). In all five cases we identify a galaxy at the redshift of the CaII system with impact parameters up to24 kpc. In four out of five cases the galaxies are luminous (LL*), metal-rich (ZZsun), massive (velocity dispersion, sigma100 km/s) spirals. Their star formation rates, deduced from Halpha emission, are high, in the range SFR = 0.3 - 30 Msun/yr. In our analysis, we paid particular attention to correcting the observed emission line fluxes for stellar absorption and dust extinction. We show that these effects are important for a correct SFR estimate; their neglect in previous low-z studies of DLA-selected galaxies has probably led to an underestimate of the star formation activity in at least some DLA hosts. We discuss possible links between CaII-selected galaxies and DLAs and outline future observations which will help clarify the relationship between these different classes of QSO absorbers. ",0,0
"The analysis of gravitational wave data involves many model selection problems. The most important example is the detection problem of selecting between the data being consistent with instrument noise alone, or instrument noise and a gravitational wave signal. The analysis of data from ground based gravitational wave detectors is mostly conducted using classical statistics, and methods such as the Neyman-Pearson criteria are used for model selection. Future space based detectors, such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), are expected to produced rich data streams containing the signals from many millions of sources. Determining the number of sources that are resolvable, and the most appropriate description of each source poses a challenging model selection problem that may best be addressed in a Bayesian framework. An important class of LISA sources are the millions of low-mass binary systems within our own galaxy, tens of thousands of which will be detectable. Not only are the number of sources unknown, but so are the number of parameters required to model the waveforms. For example, a significant subset of the resolvable galactic binaries will exhibit orbital frequency evolution, while a smaller number will have measurable eccentricity. In the Bayesian approach to model selection one needs to compute the Bayes factor between competing models. Here we explore various methods for computing Bayes factors in the context of determining which galactic binaries have measurable frequency evolution. The methods explored include a Reverse Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) algorithm, Savage-Dickie density ratios, the Schwarz-Bayes Information Criterion (BIC), and the Laplace approximation to the model evidence. We find good agreement between all of the approaches. ",0,0
"A rather non-standard quantum representation of the canonical commutation relations of quantum mechanics systems, known as the polymer representation has gained some attention in recent years, due to its possible relation with Planck scale physics. In particular, this approach has been followed in a symmetric sector of loop quantum gravity known as loop quantum cosmology. Here we explore different aspects of the relation between the ordinary Schroedinger theory and the polymer description. The paper has two parts. In the first one, we derive the polymer quantum mechanics starting from the ordinary Schroedinger theory and show that the polymer description arises as an appropriate limit. In the second part we consider the continuum limit of this theory, namely, the reverse process in which one starts from the discrete theory and tries to recover back the ordinary Schroedinger quantum mechanics. We consider several examples of interest, including the harmonic oscillator, the free particle and a simple cosmological model. ",0,0
"[Abridged] We present time-series optical photometry of five new CVs identified by the Hamburg Quasar Survey. The eclipses observed in HS 0129+2933, HS 0220+0603, and HS 0455+8315 provided very accurate orbital periods of 3.35129827(65), 3.58098501(34), and 3.56937674(26) h, respectively. HS 0805+3822 shows grazing eclipses and has a likely orbital period of 3.2169(2) h. Time-resolved optical spectroscopy of the new CVs (with the exception of HS 0805+3822) is also presented. Radial velocity studies provided an orbital period of 3.55 h for HS 1813+6122, which allowed us to identify the observed photometric signal at 3.39 h as a negative superhump wave. The spectroscopic behaviour clearly identifies these new CVs as new SW Sextantis stars. These new additions increase the number of known SW Sex stars to 35. Almost 40 per cent of the total SW Sex population do not show eclipses, invalidating the requirement of eclipses as a defining characteristic of the class and the models based on a high orbital inclination geometry alone. On the other hand, the predominance of orbital periods in the narrow 3-4.5 h range is becoming more pronounced. In fact, almost half the CVs which populate the 3-4.5 h period interval are definite members of the class. These statistics are confirmed by our results from the Hamburg Quasar Survey CVs. Remarkably, 54 per cent of the Hamburg nova-like variables have been identified as SW Sex stars with orbital periods in the 3-4.5 h range. The observation of this pile-up of systems close to the upper boundary of the period gap is difficult to reconcile with the standard theory of CV evolution, as the SW Sex stars are believed to have the highest mass transfer rates among CVs. Finally, we review the full range of common properties that the SW Sex stars exhibit. ",0,0
"Mixed action lattice calculations allow for an additive lattice spacing dependent mass renormalization of mesons composed of one sea and one valence quark, regardless of the type of fermion discretization methods used in the valence and sea sectors. The value of the mass renormalization depends upon the lattice actions used. This mixed meson mass shift is an important lattice artifact to determine for mixed action calculations; because it modifies the pion mass, it plays a central role in the low energy dynamics of all hadronic correlation functions. We determine the leading order, 𝒪(a^2), and next to leading order, 𝒪(a^2 m_π^2), additive mass shift of valence-sea mesons for a mixed lattice action with domain-wall valence fermions and rooted staggered sea fermions, relevant to the majority of current large scale mixed action lattice efforts. We find that on the asqtad improved coarse MILC lattices, this additive mass shift is well parameterized in lattice units by Δ(am)^2 = 0.034(2) -0.06(2) (a m_π)^2, which in physical units, using a=0.125 fm, corresponds to Δ(m)^2 = (291± 8 MeV)^2 -0.06(2) m_π^2. In terms of the mixed action effective field theory parameters, the corresponding mass shift is given by a^2 Δ_Mix = (316 ± 4 MeV)^2 at leading order plus next-to-leading order corrections including the necessary chiral logarithms for this mixed action calculation, determined in this work. Within the precision of our calculation, one can not distinguish between the full next-to-leading order effective field theory analysis of this additive mixed meson mass shift and the parameterization given above.

"We study the sensitivity of the ATLAS experiment to Wtb anomalous couplings in top pair production with semileptonic decay, pp -> t tbar -> W+ b W- bbar, with one of the W bosons decaying leptonically and the other hadronically. Several observables are examined, including the W helicity fractions and new quantities recently introduced, such as the ratios of helicity fractions and some angular asymmetries defined in the W rest frame. The dependence on anomalous couplings of all these observables has been previously obtained. In this work we show that some of the new observables also have smaller systematic uncertainties than the helicity fractions, with a dependence on anomalous couplings similar or stronger than for helicity fractions. Consequently, their measurement can significantly improve the limits on anomalous couplings. Moreover, the most sensitive measurements can be combined. In this case, the precision achieved in the determination of Wtb anomalous couplings can be of a few percent in the semileptonic channel alone. ",0,0
"2MASS J11011926-7732383 AB (hereafter 2M1101AB), located in the Cha I star forming region, is a rare wide-separation brown dwarf binary. XMM-Newton and Chandra observations of 2M1101AB have allowed us to examine the influence of physical parameters (mass, bolometric luminosity and effective temperature) on X-ray emission from a coeval pair of substellar objects. The spatial resolution of XMM-Newton is not sufficient to separate contributions from the two components in the binary. The X-ray source detected with XMM-Newton has a column density compatible with the infrared extinction of component A. On the other hand, the binary is resolved with Chandra, and the bulk of the X-ray emission is clearly associated with the photospherically cooler component B. These apparently contradictory results point at strong variability of 2M1101's X-ray emission. Combined with previous sensitive X-ray observations from low-mass members of ChaI, we find a decline of X-ray luminosity with decreasing (sub)stellar mass that is typical for star forming regions. 2M1101B is the coolest (spectral type M8.25) and least massive brown dwarf of ChaI detected in X-rays so far. It is also among the youngest ( 1 Myr) substellar ChaI members, and therefore relatively luminous. Most bona fide brown dwarfs of Cha I have remained below the sensitivity limits of available X-ray observations, because of their low luminosity associated with higher age. ",0,0

When an unbiased random walker passes the weak link it can be destroyed (“burned”) with probability p, providing a bias in the motion of the molecular motor. A new theoretical approach that allows one to calculate exactly all dynamic properties of motor proteins, such as velocity and dispersion, at general conditions is presented. It is found that dispersion is a decreasing function of the concentration of bridges, while the dependence of dispersion on the burning probability is more complex. Our calculations also show a gap in dispersion for very low concentrations of weak links which indicates a dynamic phase transition between unbiased and biased diffusion regimes. Theoretical findings are supported by Monte Carlo computer simulations. ",0,0
"We study the effects of charge polarization on the extended physical properties of superlattices, such as transmission coefficients and valence band structure. We consider both linear and parabolic modulation of the band edge. Based on the theory of finite periodic systems (TFPS), analytic expressions and high precision calculations of the relevant physical quantities for n-cell systems are obtained. New and also well-known features of these systems are identified. Besides the well-known energy bandstructure, we also have the field bandstructure, with interesting characteristics.Wider field gaps at stronger internal electric fields and higher density of field bands for larger layer widths are some of these characteristics. Well denned level density asymmetries identify the minibands induced by charge polarization or the so-called Quantum Confining Stark Effect. We present the n-cell transmission amplitudes, transmission coefficients and miniband structures for different values of the relevant parameters. ",0,0
"In 1929 Heisenberg and Pauli laid the foundations of QFT by quantizing the fields (method of canonical quantization). This general theory of quantized fields has remained undisputed up to now. We show how the unmodified Heisenberg-Pauli calculations make sense mathematically by using a theory of generalized functions adapted to nonlinear operations. By providing an appropriate mathematical setting, nonlinear generalized functions open doors for their understanding but there remains presumably very hard technical problems. (i) Domains of the interacting field operators: a priori the H-P calculations give time dependent dense domains, what is not very convenient; (ii) Calculations of the resulting matrix elements of the S operator: from the unitarity of the S operator as a whole there are no longer “infinities,” but a priori there is no other hope than heavy computer calculations; (iii) Connection with renormalization theory: it should provide an approximation when the coupling constant is small. The aim of this paper is to present, on the grounds of a standard mathematical model of QFT (a self interacting scalar boson field), a basis for improvement without significant prerequisites in mathematics and physics. It is an attempt to use nonlinear generalized functions in QFT, starting directly from the calculations made by physicists, in the same way as they have already been used in classical mechanics and general relativity.

"We have employed a 3-d energy-conserving radiation MHD code to simulate the vertical structure and thermodynamics of a shearing box whose parameters were chosen so that the radiation and gas pressures would be comparable. The upper layers of this disk segment are magnetically-dominated, creating conditions appropriate for both photon bubble and Parker instabilities. We find little evidence for photon bubbles, even though the simulation has enough spatial resolution to see them and their predicted growth rates are high. On the other hand, there is strong evidence for Parker instabilities, and they appear to dominate the evolution of the magnetically supported surface layers. The disk photosphere is complex, with large density inhomogeneities at both the scattering and effective (thermalization) photospheres of the evolving horizontally-averaged structure. Both the dominant magnetic support and the inhomogeneities are likely to have strong effects on the spectrum and polarization of thermal photons emerging from the disk atmosphere. The inhomogeneities are also large enough to affect models of reflection spectra from the atmospheres of accretion disks. ",0,0
"We compute one of the bulk viscosity coefficients of cold CFL quark matter in the temperature regime where the contribution of mesons, quarks and gluons to transport phenomena is Boltzmann suppressed. In that regime dissipation occurs due to collisions of superfluid phonons, the Goldstone modes associated to the spontaneous breaking of baryon symmetry. We first review the hydrodynamics of relativistic superfluids, and remind that there are at least three bulk viscosity coefficients in these systems. We then compute the bulk viscosity coefficient associated to the normal fluid component of the superfluid. In our analysis we use Son's effective field theory for the superfluid phonon, amended to include scale breaking effects proportional to the square of the strange quark mass m_s. We compute the bulk viscosity at leading order in the scale breaking parameter, and find that it is dominated by collinear splitting and joining processes. The resulting transport coefficient is zeta=0.011 m_s^4/T, growing at low temperature T until the phonon fluid description stops making sense. Our results are relevant to study the rotational properties of a compact star formed by CFL quark matter. ",0,0
"Non-perturbative corrections and modular properties of four-dimensional type IIB Calabi-Yau orientifolds are discussed. It is shown that certain non-perturbative alpha' corrections survive in the large volume limit of the orientifold and periodically correct the Kahler potential. These corrections depend on the NS-NS two form and have to be completed by D-instanton contributions to transform covariantely under symmetries of the type IIB orientifold background. It is shown that generically also the D-instanton superpotential depends on the two-form moduli as well as on the complex dilaton. These contributions can arise through theta-functions with the dilaton as modular parameter. An orientifold of the Enriques Calabi-Yau allows to illustrate these general considerations. It is shown that this compactification leads to a controlled four-dimensional N=1 effective theory due to the absence of various quantum corrections. Making contact to the underlying topological string theory the D-instanton superpotential is proposed to be related to a specific modular form counting D3, D1, D(-1) degeneracies on the Enriques Calabi-Yau.

"We analyse and compare the complexity of several algorithms for computing modular polynomials. We show that an algorithm relying on floating point evaluation of modular functions and on interpolation, which has received little attention in the literature, has a complexity that is essentially (up to logarithmic factors) linear in the size of the computed polynomials. In particular, it obtains the classical modular polynomials Φ_ℓ of prime level ℓ in time O (ℓ^3 log^4 ℓloglogℓ). Besides treating modular polynomials for Γ^0 (ℓ), which are an important ingredient in many algorithms dealing with isogenies of elliptic curves, the algorithm is easily adapted to more general situations. Composite levels are handled just as easily as prime levels, as well as polynomials between a modular function and its transform of prime level, such as the Schläfli polynomials and their generalisations. Our distributed implementation of the algorithm confirms the theoretical analysis by computing modular equations of record level around 10000 in less than two weeks on ten processors. ",0,0
"The subject of micro-variability among Mira stars has received increased attention since DeLaverny et al. (1998) reported short-term brightness variations in 15 percent of the 250 Mira or Long Period Variable stars surveyed using the broadband 340 to 890 nm Hp filter on the HIPPARCOS satellite. The abrupt variations reported ranged 0.2 to 1.1 magnitudes, on time-scales between 2 to 100 hours, with a preponderance found nearer Mira minimum light phases. However, the HIPPARCOS sampling frequency was extremely sparse and required confirmation because of potentially important atmospheric dynamics and dust-formation physics that could be revealed. We report on Mira light curve sub-structure based on new CCD V and R band data, augmenting the known light curves of Hipparcos-selected long period variables [LPVs], and interpret same in terms of [1] interior structure, [2] atmospheric structure change, and/or [3] formation of circumstellar [CS] structure. We propose that the alleged micro-variability among Miras is largely undersampled, transient overtone pulsation structure in the light curves. ",0,0
"In an earlier paper, the effect of the nearby known supernova remnants (SNRs) on the local cosmic-rays (CRs) was studied, considering different possible forms of the particle injection time. The present work is a continuation of the previous work, but assumes a more realistic model of CR propagation in the Galaxy. The previous work assumed an unbounded three-dimensional diffusion region, whereas the present one considers a flat cylindrical disc bounded in both the radial and vertical directions. The study has found that the effect of the vertical halo boundary H on the local SNR contribution to the observed CR anisotropy is negligible as long as H≳ 2kpc. Considering the values of the halo height H≳ 2kpc obtained by different authors, the present work suggests that the study of the effect of local sources on the CR anisotropy can be carried out without having much information on H and hence, using the much simpler three-dimentional unbounded solution. Finally, the present work discusses about the possibility of explaining the observed anisotropy below the knee by a single dominant source with properly chosen source parameters, and claims that the source may be an undetected old SNR with a characteristic age of ∼ 1.5× 10^5 yr located at a distance of ∼ 0.57 kpc from the Sun.

"We consider a recently proposed scenario for the generation of primordial cosmological perturbations, the so called Cosmological Slingshot scenario. We firstly obtain a general expression for the Slingshot primordial power spectrum which extends previous results by including a blue pre-bounce residual contribution at large scales. Starting from this expression we numerically compute the CMB temperature and polarization power spectra arising from the Slingshot scenario and show that they excellently match the standard WMAP 3-years best-fit results. In particular, if the residual blue spectrum is far above the largest WMAP observed scale, the Slingshot primordial spectrum fits the data well by only fixing its amplitude and spectral index at the pivot scale k_p=10^-3h x Mpc^-1. We finally show that all possible distinctive Slingshot signatures in the CMB power spectra are confined to very low multipoles and thus very hard to detect due to large cosmic variance dominated error bars at these scales.

"We introduce a novel migration process, the target process. This process is dual to the zero-range process (ZRP) in the sense that, while for the ZRP the rate of transfer of a particle only depends on the occupation of the departure site, it only depends on the occupation of the arrival site for the target process. More precisely, duality associates to a given ZRP a unique target process, and vice-versa. If the dynamics is symmetric, i.e., in the absence of a bias, both processes have the same stationary-state product measure. In this work we focus our interest on the situation where the latter measure exhibits a continuous condensation transition at some finite critical density ρ_c, irrespective of the dimensionality. The novelty comes from the case of asymmetric dynamics, where the target process has a nontrivial fluctuating stationary state, whose characteristics depend on the dimensionality. In one dimension, the system remains homogeneous at any finite density. An alternating scenario however prevails in the high-density regime: typical configurations consist of long alternating sequences of highly occupied and less occupied sites. The local density of the latter is equal to ρ_c and their occupation distribution is critical. In dimension two and above, the asymmetric target process exhibits a phase transition at a threshold density ρ_0 much larger than ρ_c. The system is homogeneous at any density below ρ_0, whereas for higher densities it exhibits an extended condensate elongated along the direction of the mean current, on top of a critical background with density ρ_c.

"In this notes unbounded regular operators on Hilbert C^*-modules over arbitrary C^*-algebras are discussed. A densely defined operator t possesses an adjoint operator if the graph of t is an orthogonal summand. Moreover, for a densely defined operator t the graph of t is orthogonally complemented and the range of P_FP_G(t)^ is dense in its biorthogonal complement if and only if t is regular. For a given C^*-algebra 𝒜 any densely defined 𝒜-linear closed operator t between Hilbert C^*-modules is regular, if and only if any densely defined 𝒜-linear closed operator t between Hilbert C^*-modules admits a densely defined adjoint operator, if and only if 𝒜 is a C^*-algebra of compact operators.

"Using data recorded by the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) instrument on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), we have traced 123 pairs of opposite magnetic polarity moving magnetic features (MMFs) in three active regions NOAA ARs 8375, 0330 and 9575. At the time of observation, AR 8375 was young, AR 0330 mature, and AR 9575 decaying. The vertical velocity indicates that the elements of MMF pairs with polarity opposite to that of the sunspot support a downflow of around 50-100 m s^-1. The average Doppler shift difference between negative and positive elements of an MMF pair is about 150 m s^-1 in AR 8375, 100 m s^-1 in AR 0330, and 20 m s^-1 in AR 9575. These observational results are in agreement with the model that MMF pairs are part of a U-loop emanating from the sunspot's magnetic canopy. According to this model the downflow is caused by the Evershed flow returning below the solar surface. For AR 8375, the horizontal velocity of MMFs ranges from 0.1 km s^-1 to 0.7 km s^-1, and on average, the velocity of an MMF pair decreases significantly (from 0.6 km s^-1 to 0.35 km s^-1) with increasing distance from the MMF's birth place. This result suggests that the change in MMF flow speed does not reflect the radial structure of the moat flow, but rather is intrinsic to the evolution of the MMF pairs. This result is also in agreement with the U-loop model of MMF pairs. We also find that properties of MMF pairs, most strikingly the lifetime, depend on the evolution stages of the parent sunspot. The mean lifetimes of MMF pairs in ARs 9575 and 0330 are 0.7 hours and 1.6 hours, respectively, which is considerably shorter than the 4 hours lifetime previously found for AR 8375. ",0,0
"We study the intersection points of a fixed planar curve Γ with the nodal set of a translationally invariant and isotropic Gaussian random field Ψ(r) and the zeros of its normal derivative across the curve. The intersection points form a discrete random process which is the object of this study. The field probability distribution function is completely specified by the correlation G(|r-r'|) = <Ψ(r) Ψ(r')>.Given an arbitrary G(|r-r'|), we compute the two point correlation function of the point process on the line, and derive other statistical measures (repulsion, rigidity) which characterize the short and long range correlations of the intersection points. We use these statistical measures to quantitatively characterize the complex patterns displayed by various kinds of nodal networks. We apply these statistics in particular to nodal patterns of random waves and of eigenfunctions of chaotic billiards. Of special interest is the observation that for monochromatic random waves, the number variance of the intersections with long straight segments grows like L ln L, as opposed to the linear growth predicted by the percolation model, which was successfully used to predict other long range nodal properties of that field.

"Swift triggered on a precursor to the main burst of GRB 061121 (z=1.314), allowing observations to be made from the optical to gamma-ray bands. Many other telescopes, including Konus-Wind, XMM-Newton, ROTSE and the Faulkes Telescope North, also observed the burst. The gamma-ray, X-ray and UV/optical emission all showed a peak75s after the trigger, although the optical and X-ray afterglow components also appear early on - before, or during, the main peak. Spectral evolution was seen throughout the burst, with the prompt emission showing a clear positive correlation between brightness and hardness. The Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of the prompt emission, stretching from 1eV up to 1MeV, is very flat, with a peak in the flux density at1keV. The optical-to-X-ray spectra at this time are better fitted by a broken, rather than single, power-law, similar to previous results for X-ray flares. The SED shows spectral hardening as the afterglow evolves with time. This behaviour might be a symptom of self-Comptonisation, although circumstellar densities similar to those found in the cores of molecular clouds would be required. The afterglow also decays too slowly to be accounted for by the standard models. Although the precursor and main emission show different spectral lags, both are consistent with the lag-luminosity correlation for long bursts. GRB 061121 is the instantaneously brightest long burst yet detected by Swift. Using a combination of Swift and Konus-Wind data, we estimate an isotropic energy of 2.8x10^53 erg over 1keV - 10MeV in the GRB rest frame. A probable jet break is detected at2x10^5s, leading to an estimate of10^51 erg for the beaming-corrected gamma-ray energy. ",0,0

"A geometric setup for control theory is presented. The argument is developed through the study of the extremals of action functionals defined on piecewise differentiable curves, in the presence of differentiable non-holonomic constraints. Special emphasis is put on the tensorial aspects of the theory. To start with, the kinematical foundations, culminating in the so called variational equation, are put on geometrical grounds, via the introduction of the concept of infinitesimal control . On the same basis, the usual classification of the extremals of a variational problem into normal and abnormal ones is also rationalized, showing the existence of a purely kinematical algorithm assigning to each admissible curve a corresponding abnormality index, defined in terms of a suitable linear map. The whole machinery is then applied to constrained variational calculus. The argument provides an interesting revisitation of Pontryagin maximum principle and of the Erdmann-Weierstrass corner conditions, as well as a proof of the classical Lagrange multipliers method and a local interpretation of Pontryagin's equations as dynamical equations for a free (singular) Hamiltonian system. As a final, highly non-trivial topic, a sufficient condition for the existence of finite deformations with fixed endpoints is explicitly stated and proved. ",0,0
"A general and basic model of primordial evolution–a soup of reacting finitary and discrete processes–is employed to identify and analyze fundamental mechanisms that generate and maintain complex structures in prebiotic systems. The processes–ϵ-machines as defined in computational mechanics–and their interaction networks both provide well defined notions of structure. This enables us to quantitatively demonstrate hierarchical self-organization in the soup in terms of complexity. We found that replicating processes evolve the strategy of successively building higher levels of organization by autocatalysis. Moreover, this is facilitated by local components that have low structural complexity, but high generality. In effect, the finitary process soup spontaneously evolves a selection pressure that favors such components. In light of the finitary process soup's generality, these results suggest a fundamental law of hierarchical systems: global complexity requires local simplicity. ",0,0
"The analysis of SN1987A led Brown and Bethe (1995) to conclusion, that the maximum mass of cold neutron stars is low, M_max1.5M_sun. Such a low M_max, due to a kaon condensation in the stellar core, implies collapse of a too massive deleptonized protoneutron star into a black hole. This would naturally explain the lack of a neutron star in the SN1987A remnant. On the other hand, recent evaluation of mass of PSR J0751+1807 gives M_max > 2M_sun. This contradicts the original Bethe-Brown model, but can be reconciled within scenarios proposed in the present Letter. We consider two types of dense matter models with high-density softening, due to a transition from a non-strange N-phase of matter to a strangeness carrying phase S: kaon condensation and deconfinement of quarks. Two scenarios of neutron star formation in stellar core collapse are considered. In the first scenario, realized in sufficiently hot and dense supernova cores, nucleation of an S-phase is sufficiently rapid so as to form an S-phase core, and implying M_max = M^S_max =1.5M_sun. In the second scenario, nucleation of the S-phase at neutron star birth is too slow to materialize, and the star becomes cold without forming an S-phase core. Then, stellar mass can increase via accretion, until central density ρ_crit is reached, and the S phase forms. This N branch of neutron stars ends at M=M_crit. We select several models of N-phase satifying the necessary condition M^N_max > 2M_sun and combine them with models of kaon condensation and quark deconfinement. For kaon condensation, we get M_crit =M^S_max =1.5M_sun, which is ruled out by PSR J0751+1807. On the contrary, for the EOSs with quark deconfinement we get M_crit =M^N_max > 2M_sun, which reconciles SN1987A and PSR J0751+1807. ",0,0

"The synergy of GLAST and the proposed EXIST mission as the Black Hole Finder Probe in the Beyond Einstein Program is remarkable.

Such studies also constrain the physics of jets (and parameters and indeed the validity of SSC models) and the origin of the >100 MeV gamma-ray diffuse background likely arising from Blazars and jet-dominated sources.

"Using archival RXTE data we derive the 2-16 keV Fourier-resolved spectra of the Atoll source 4U 1728-34 in a sequence of its timing states as its low QPO frequency spans the range between 6 and 94 Hz. The increase in the QPO frequency accompanies a spectral transition of the source from its island to its banana states. The banana-states' Fourier-resolved spectra are well fitted by a single blackbody component with kT ∼ 2-3 keV depending on the source position in the color – color diagram and the Fourier frequency, thus indicating that this spectral component is responsible for the source variability on these timescales. This result is in approximate agreement with similar behavior exhibited by the Z sources, suggesting that, as in that case, the boundary layer – the likely source of the thermal component – is supported by radiation pressure. Furthermore, it is found that the iron line at ∼6.6 keV, clearly present in the averaged spectra, not apparent within the limitations of our measurements in the frequency-resolved spectra irrespective of the frequency range. This would indicate that this spectral component exhibits little variability on time scales comprising the interval 10^-2-10^2 seconds. In the island state the single blackbody model proved inadequate, particularly notable in our lowest frequency band (0.008-0.8 Hz). An absorbed powerlaw or an additive blackbody plus hard powerlaw model was required to obtain a satisfactory fit. Statistics do not allow unambiguous discrimination between these possible scenarios.

"We study the propagation of gravitons within 5-D supersymmetric braneworld models with a bulk scalar field. The setup considered here consists of a 5-D bulk spacetime bounded by two 4-D branes localized at the fixed points of an S^1/Z_2 orbifold. There is a scalar field ϕ in the bulk which, provided a superpotential W(ϕ), determines the warped geometry of the 5-D spacetime. This type of scenario is common in string theory, where the bulk scalar field ϕ is related to the volume of small compact extra dimensions. We show that, after the moduli are stabilized by supersymmetry breaking terms localized on the branes, the only relevant degrees of freedom in the bulk consist of a 5-D massive spectrum of gravitons. Then we analyze the gravitational interaction between massive bodies localized at the positive tension brane mediated by these bulk gravitons. It is shown that the Newtonian potential describing this interaction picks up a non-trivial contribution at short distances that depends on the shape of the superpotential W(ϕ). We compute this contribution for dilatonic braneworld scenarios W(ϕ) = e^αϕ (where α is a constant) and discuss the particular case of 5-D Heterotic M-theory: It is argued that a specific footprint at micron scales could be observable in the near future.

"In this letter we investigate acceleration in the flat cosmological model with a conformally coupled phantom field and we show that acceleration is its generic feature.

We also study the behaviour near this attractor, which can be approximated by the dynamics of the linearized part of the system. We demonstrate that trajectories of the conformally coupled phantom scalar field with a simple quadratic potential crosses the cosmological constant barrier infinitely many times in the phase space. The universal behaviour of the scalar field and its potential is also calculated.

"Atoms at liquid metal surfaces are known to form layers parallel to the surface. We analyze the two-dimensional arrangement of atoms within such layers at the surface of liquid sodium, using ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on density functional theory. Nearest neighbor distributions at the surface indicate mostly 5-fold coordination, though there are noticeable fractions of 4-fold and 6-fold coordinated atoms. Bond angle distributions suggest a movement toward the angles corresponding to a six-fold coordinated hexagonal arrangement of the atoms as the temperature is decreased towards the solidification point. We rationalize these results with a distorted hexagonal order at the surface, showing a mixture of regions of five and six-fold coordination. The liquid surface results are compared with classical MD simulations of the liquid surface, with similar effects appearing, and with ab initio MD simulations for a model solid-liquid interface, where a pronounced shift towards hexagonal ordering is observed as the temperature is lowered.

"Within a general theoretical framework we study the effective, deformation-induced interaction between two colloidal particles trapped at a fluid interface in the regime of small deformations. In many studies, this interaction has been computed with the ansatz that the actual interface configuration for the pair is given by the linear superposition of the interface deformations around the single particles. Here we assess the validity of this approach and compute the leading term of the effective interaction for large interparticle separation beyond this so-called superposition approximation. As an application, we consider the experimentally relevant case of interface deformations owing to the electrostatic field emanating from charged colloidal particles. In mechanical isolation, i.e., if the net force acting on the total system consisting of the particles plus the interface vanishes, the superposition approximation is actually invalid. The effective capillary interaction is governed by contributions beyond this approximation and turns out to be attractive. For sufficiently small surface charges on the colloids, such that linearization is strictly valid, and at asymptotically large separations, the effective interaction does not overcome the direct electrostatic repulsion between the colloidal particles.

"We study bottlebrush macromolecules in a good solvent by small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), static light scattering (SLS), and dynamic light scattering (DLS). These polymers consist of a linear backbone to which long side chains are chemically grafted. The backbone contains about 1600 monomer units (weight average) and every second monomer unit carries side-chains with ca. 60 monomer units. The SLS- and SANS data extrapolated to infinite dilution lead to the form factor of the polymer that can be described in terms of a worm-like chain with a contour length of 380 nm and a persistence length of 17.5 nm. An analysis of the DLS data confirm these model parameters. The scattering intensities taken at finite concentration can be modeled using the polymer reference interaction site model. It reveals a softening of the bottlebrush polymers caused by their mutual interaction. We demonstrate that the persistence decreases from 17.5 nm down to 5 nm upon increasing the concentration from dilute solution to the highest concentration 40.59 g/l under consideration. The observed softening of the chains is comparable to the theoretically predicted decrease of the electrostatic persistence length of linear polyelectrolyte chains at finite concentrations. ",0,0

On the other hand, strongly favouring the hydrogen-like interactions give rise to an anisotropic folded (solid-like) phase on lowering the temperature. We use Monte Carlo simulations up to a length of 256 to map out the phase diagram in the plane of parameters and determine the order of the associated phase transitions. We discuss the connections to semi-flexible polymers and other polymer models. Importantly, we demonstrate that for a range of energy parameters two phase transitions occur on lowering the temperature, the second being a transition from the globule state to the crystal state. We argue from our data that this globule-to-crystal transition is continuous in two dimensions in accord with field-theory arguments concerning Hamiltonian walks, but is first order in three dimensions.

"As ASTROD I travels through space, its test mass will accrue charge due to galactic cosmic-rays and solar energetic particles incident on the spacecraft. This test mass charge will result in Coulomb forces between the test mass and the surrounding electrodes. In earlier work using the GEANT4 toolkit, we predicted a net charging rate of nearly 9.0 +e/s from cosmic-ray protons between 0.1 and 1000 GeV at solar maximum, and rising to 26.5 +e/s at solar minimum. Here we use GEANT4 to simulate the charging process due to solar energetic particle events and to estimate the magnitude of acceleration noise due to this charging. The predicted charging rates range from 2840 to 64300 +e/s, at peak intensity, for the 4 largest SEP events in September and October 1989. For the 2 larger events, the acceleration disturbances due to charging exceeds the ASTROD I acceleration noise budget requirement. Continuous discharge should be considered for suppressing this charging noise. The acceleration noise during the 2 small events is well below the design target, although during these events, the net charging rate will be dominated by these solar fluxes. ",0,0
"The Standard Model indicates the realization of grand unified structures in nature, and can only be viewed as an effective theory below a higher energy cutoff. While the renormalizable Standard Model forbids proton decay mediating operators due to accidental global symmetries, many extensions of the Standard Model introduce such dimension four, five and six operators. Furthermore, quantum gravity effects are expected to induce proton instability, indicating that the higher energy cutoff scale must be above 10^16GeV. Quasi-realistic heterotic string models provide the arena to explore how perturbative quantum gravity affects the particle physics phenomenology. An appealing explanation for the proton longevity is provided by the existence of an Abelian gauge symmetry that suppresses the proton decay mediating operators. Additionally, such a low-scale U(1) symmetry should: allow the suppression of the left-handed neutrino masses by a seesaw mechanism; allow fermion Yukawa couplings to the electroweak Higgs doublets; be anomaly free; be family universal. These requirements render the existence of such U(1) symmetries in quasi-realistic heterotic string models highly non-trivial. We demonstrate the existence of a U(1) symmetry that satisfies all of the above requirements in a class of left-right symmetric heterotic string models in the free fermionic formulation. The existence of the extra Z' in the energy range accessible to future experiments is motivated by the requirement of adequate suppression of proton decay mediation. We further show that while the extra U(1) forbids dimension four baryon number violating operators it allows dimension four lepton number violating operators and R-parity violation. ",0,0
"We implement a standard Monte Carlo algorithm to study the slow, equilibrium dynamics of a silica melt in a wide temperature regime, from 6100 K down to 2750 K. We find that the average dynamical behaviour of the system is in quantitative agreement with results obtained from molecular dynamics simulations, at least in the long-time regime corresponding to the alpha-relaxation. By contrast, the strong thermal vibrations related to the Boson peak present at short times in molecular dynamics are efficiently suppressed by the Monte Carlo algorithm. This allows us to reconsider silica dynamics in the context of mode-coupling theory, because several shortcomings of the theory were previously attributed to thermal vibrations. A mode-coupling theory analysis of our data is qualitatively correct, but quantitative tests of the theory fail, raising doubts about the very existence of an avoided singularity in this system. We discuss the emergence of dynamic heterogeneity and report detailed measurements of a decoupling between translational diffusion and structural relaxation, and of a growing four-point dynamic susceptibility. Dynamic heterogeneity appears to be less pronounced than in more fragile glass-forming models, but not of a qualitatively different nature. ",0,0
"We propose a Hamiltonian formalism for a generalized Friedmann-Roberson-Walker cosmology model in the presence of both a variable equation of state (EOS) parameter w(a) and a variable cosmological constant Λ(a), where a is the scale factor. This Hamiltonian system containing 1 degree of freedom and without constraint, gives Friedmann equations as the equation of motion, which describes a mechanical system with a variable mass object moving in a potential field. After an appropriate transformation of the scale factor, this system can be further simplified to an object with constant mass moving in an effective potential field. In this framework, the Λ cold dark matter model as the current standard model of cosmology corresponds to a harmonic oscillator. We further generalize this formalism to take into account the bulk viscosity and other cases. The Hamiltonian can be quantized straightforwardly, but this is different from the approach of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in quantum cosmology. ",0,0
"Longitudinal data tracking repeated measurements on individuals are highly valued for research because they offer controls for unmeasured individual heterogeneity that might otherwise bias results. Random effects or mixed models approaches, which treat individual heterogeneity as part of the model error term and use generalized least squares to estimate model parameters, are often criticized because correlation between unobserved individual effects and other model variables can lead to biased and inconsistent parameter estimates. Starting with an examination of the relationship between random effects and fixed effects estimators in the standard unobserved effects model, this article demonstrates through analysis and simulation that the mixed model approach has a “bias compression” property under a general model for individual heterogeneity that can mitigate bias due to uncontrolled differences among individuals. The general model is motivated by the complexities of longitudinal student achievement measures, but the results have broad applicability to longitudinal modeling. ",0,0
"To deflect impact-trajectory of massive km^3 and spinning asteroid by a few terrestrial radius one need a large momentum exchange. The dragging of huge spinning bodies in space by external engine seems difficult or impossible. Our solution is based on the landing of multi screw-rockets, powered by mini-nuclear engines, on the body, that dig a small fraction of the soil surface, to use as an exhaust propeller, ejecting it vertically in phase among themselves. Such a mass ejection increases the momentum exchange, their number redundancy guarantees the stability of the system. The slow landing (below 40 cm s^-1) of each engine-unity at those lowest gravity field, may be achieved by save rolling and bouncing along the surface. The engine array tuned activity, overcomes the asteroid angular velocity. Coherent turning of the jet heads increases the deflection efficiency. A procession along its surface may compensate at best the asteroid spin. A small skin-mass (about 2 10^4 tons) may be ejected by mini nuclear engines. Such prototypes may also build first save galleries for humans on the Moon. Conclusive deflecting tests might be performed on remote asteroids. The incoming asteroid 99942 Apophis (just 2",0,0
"We show that the Galois group Gal( /) operates faithfully on the set of connected components of the moduli spaces of surfaces of general type, and also that for each element σ∈ Gal( /) different from the identity and from complex conjugation, there is a surface of general type such that X and the Galois conjugate variety X^σ have nonisomorphic fundamental groups. The result was announced by the second author at the Alghero Conference 'Topology of algebraic varieties' in september 2006. Before the present paper was actually written, we received a very interesting preprint by Robert Easton and Ravi Vakil (<cit.>), where it is proven, with a completely different type of examples, that the Galois group Gal( /) operates faithfully on the set of irreducible components of the moduli spaces of surfaces of general type. We also give other simpler examples of surfaces with nonisomorphic fundamental groups which are Galois conjugate, hence have isomorphic algebraic fundamental groups. ",0,0
"A supersymmetric extension of the dynamical symmetry group Sp^B(12,R) of the Interacting Vector Boson Model (IVBM), to the orthosymplectic group OSp(2Ω/12,R) is developed in order to incorporate fermion degrees of freedom into the nuclear dynamics and to encompass the treatment of odd mass nuclei. The bosonic sector of the supergroup is used to describe the complex collective spectra of the neighboring even-even nuclei and is considered as a core structure of the odd nucleus. The fermionic sector is represented by the fermion spin group SO^F(2Ω)⊃ SU^F(2).The so obtained, new exactly solvable limiting case is applied for the description of the nuclear collective spectra of odd mass nuclei. The theoretical predictions for different collective bands in three odd mass nuclei, namely ^157Gd, ^173Yb and ^163Dy from rare earth region are compared with the experiment. The B(E2) transition probabilities for the ^157Gd and ^163Dy between the states of the ground band are also studied. The important role of the symplectic structure of the model for the proper reproduction of the B(E2) behavior is revealed. The obtained results reveal the applicability of the models extension. ",0,0
"We investigate the DFT+U approach as a viable solution to describe the low-lying states of ligated and unligated iron heme complexes. Besides their central role in organometallic chemistry, these compounds represent a paradigmatic case where LDA, GGA, and common hybrid functionals fail to reproduce the experimental magnetic splittings. In particular, the imidazole pentacoordinated heme is incorrectly described as a triplet by all usual DFT flavors. In this study we show that a U parameter close to 4 eV leads to spin transitions and molecular geometries in quantitative agreement with experiments, and that DFT+U represents an appealing tool in the description of iron porphyrin complexes, at a much reduced cost compared to correlated quantum-chemistry methods. The possibility of obtaining the U parameter from first-principles is explored through a self-consistent linear-response formulation. We find that this approach, which proved to be successful in other iron systems, produces in this case some overestimation with respect to the optimal values of U. ",0,0
"Yang's theorem forbids the process Z^0 → 2γ in any Poincaré invariant theory if photons are bosons and their two-particle states transform under the Poincaré group in the standard way (under the standard coproduct of the Poincaré group). This is an important result as it does not depend on the assumptions of quantum field theory. Recent work on noncommutative geometry requires deforming the above coproduct by the Drinfel'd twist. We prove that Z^0 → 2γ is forbidden for the twisted coproduct as well. This result is also independent of the assumptions of quantum field theory. As an illustration of the use of our general formulae, we further show that Z^0 →ν + ν is forbidden for the standard or twisted coproduct of the Poincaré group if the neutrino is massless, even if lepton number is not conserved. This is a special case of our general result that a massive particle of spin j cannot decay into two identical massless particles of the same helicity if j is odd, regardless of the coproduct used.

"To study the effects of galactic winds on the stellar metallicity distributions and on the evolution of Draco and Ursa Minor dwarf spheroidal galaxies, we compared the predictions of several chemical evolution models, adopting different prescriptions for the galactic winds, with the photometrically-derived stellar metallicity distributions of both galaxies. The chemical evolution models for Draco and Ursa Minor, which are able to reproduce several observational features of these two galaxies, such as the several abundance ratios, take up-to-date nucleosynthesis into account for intermediate-mass stars and supernovae of both types, as well as the effect of these objects on the energetics of the systems. For both galaxies, the model that best fits the data contains an intense continuous galactic wind, occurring at a rate proportional to the star formation rate. Models with a wind rate assumed to be proportional only to the supernova rate also reproduce the observed SMD, but do not match the gas mass, whereas the models with no galactic winds fail to reproduce the observed SMDs. In the case of Ursa Minor, the same model as in previous works reproduces the observed distribution very well with no need to modify the main parameters of the model. The model for Draco, on the other hand, is slightly modified. The observed SMD requires a model with a lower supernova type Ia thermalization efficiency (η_SNeIa = 0.5 instead of η_SNeIa = 1.0) in order to delay the galactic wind, whereas all the other parameters are kept the same. The model results, compared to observations, strongly suggest that intense and continuous galactic winds play a very important role in the evolution of local dSphs. ",0,0
"Recent results from the HESS gamma ray telescope have shown the presence of both a diffuse, extended, flux of gamma rays above0.4 TeV and discrete sources in and near the Galactic Centre. Here, we put forward a possible explanation in terms of the diffusion of cosmic ray protons from a succession of supernova remnants (SNR) in the SgrA* region of the Galaxy plus a contribution from SNR in the rest of the Galactic Centre Region, to be called the Galactic Centre Ridge (GCR). Protons are favoured over electrons because the mG magnetic fields in the Region will attenuate energetic electrons severely. Prominent features are the need for 'anomalous diffusion' of the protons in the whole region and the adoption of low efficiency for SNR acceleration in the high density regions. The latter is related by us to the well-known low 'cosmic ray gradient' in the Galaxy. A corroborating feature is the close correlation of inferred cosmic ray intensity with the smoothed intensity of 5 GHZ radio radiation. We attribute this to the presence of the SNR in the GCR. ",0,0
"In previous work done by us and coworkers, we have been able to construct a local, non-Abelian gauge invariant action with a mass parameter, based on the nonlocal gauge invariant mass dimension two operator F1/D^2F. The renormalizability of the resulting action was proven to all orders of perturbation theory, in the class of linear covariant gauges. We also discussed the perturbative equivalence of the model with ordinary massless Yang-Mills gauge theories when the mass is identically zero. Furthermore, we pointed out the existence of a BRST symmetry with corresponding nilpotent charge. In this paper, we study the issue of unitarity of this massive gauge model. Firstly, we provide a short review how to discuss the unitarity making use of the BRST charge. Afterwards we make a detailed study of the most general version of our action, and we come to the conclusion that the model is not unitary, as we are unable to remove all the negative norm states from the physical spectrum in a consistent way.

"This chapter summarizes analytic theory and numerical calculations for the formation and collisional evolution of KBOs at 20–150 AU. We describe the main predictions of a baseline self-stirring model and show how dynamical perturbations from a stellar flyby or stirring by a giant planet modify the evolution. Although robust comparisons between observations and theory require better KBO statistics and more comprehensive calculations, the data are broadly consistent with KBO formation in a massive disk followed by substantial collisional grinding and dynamical ejection. However, there are important problems reconciling the results of coagulation and dynamical calculations. Contrasting our current understanding of the evolution of KBOs and asteroids suggests that additional observational constraints, such as the identification of more dynamical families of KBOs (like the 2003 EL61 family), would provide additional information on the relative roles of collisional grinding and dynamical ejection in the Kuiper Belt. The uncertainties also motivate calculations that combine collisional and dynamical evolution, a `unified' calculation that should give us a better picture of KBO formation and evolution. ",0,0
"We describe the derivation of the InterHourly Variability (IHV) index of geomagnetic activity. The IHV-index for a geomagnetic element is mechanically derived from hourly values as the sum of the unsigned differences between adjacent hours over a seven-hour interval centered on local midnight. The index is derived separately for stations in both hemispheres within six longitude sectors using only local night hours. It is intended as a long-term index. Available data allows derivation of the index back well into the 19th century. On a time scale of a 27-day Bartels rotation, IHV averages for stations with corrected geomagnetic latitude less than 55 degrees are strongly correlated with midlatitude range indices. Assuming a constant calibration of the aa-index we find that observed yearly values of aa before the year 1957 are 2.9 nT too small compared to values calculated from IHV using the regression constants based on 1980-2004. We interpret this discrepancy as an indication that the calibration of the aa index is in error before 1957. There is no such problem with the ap index. Rotation averages of IHV are also strongly correlated with solar wind parameters (BV^2). On a time scale of a year combining the IHV-index and the recently-developed Inter-Diurnal Variability (IDV) index (giving B) allows determination of solar wind speed, V, from 1890-present. Over the120-year series, the yearly mean solar wind speed varied from a low of 303 km/s in 1902 to a high value of 545 km/s in 2003. The calculated yearly values of the product BV using B and V separately derived from IDV and IHV agree quantitatively with (completely independent) BV derived from the amplitude of the diurnal variation of the H component in the polar caps since 1926 and sporadically beyond.

"We present Gemini integral field spectroscopy and Keck II longslit spectroscopy of the extended emission-line region (EELR) around the quasar 4C 37.43. The velocity structure of the ionized gas is complex and cannot be explained globally by a simple dynamical model. The spectra from the clouds are inconsistent with shock or “shock + precursor” ionization models, but they are consistent with photoionization by the quasar nucleus. The best-fit photoionization model requires a low-metallicity (12+log(O/H) < 8.7) two-phase medium, consisting of a matter-bounded diffuse component with a unity filling-factor (N1 , T15000 K), in which are embedded small, dense clouds (N400 , T10^4 K). The high-density clouds are transient and can be re-generated through compressing the diffuse medium by low-speed shocks (V_S ≲100 ). Our photoionization model gives a total mass for the ionized gas of about 3x10^10 M_sun, and the total kinetic energy implied by this mass and the observed velocity field is2x10^58 ergs. The fact that luminous EELRs are confined to steep-spectrum radio-loud quasars, yet show no morphological correspondence to the radio jets, suggests that the driving force producing the 4C 37.43 EELR was a roughly spherical blast wave initiated by the production of the jet. That such a mechanism seems capable of ejecting a mass comparable to that of the total interstellar medium of the Milky Way suggests that “quasar-mode” feedback may indeed be an efficient means of regulating star formation in the early universe.

"We compute solutions of the Lagrangian-Averaged Navier-Stokes alpha-model (LANS) for significantly higher Reynolds numbers (up to Re 8300) than have previously been accomplished. This allows sufficient separation of scales to observe a Navier-Stokes (NS) inertial range followed by a 2nd LANS inertial range. The analysis of the third-order structure function scaling supports the predicted l^3 scaling; it corresponds to a k^(-1) scaling of the energy spectrum. The energy spectrum itself shows a different scaling which goes as k^1. This latter spectrum is consistent with the absence of stretching in the sub-filter scales due to the Taylor frozen-in hypothesis employed as a closure in the derivation of LANS. These two scalings are conjectured to coexist in different spatial portions of the flow. The l^3 (E(k) k^(-1)) scaling is subdominant to k^1 in the energy spectrum, but the l^3 scaling is responsible for the direct energy cascade, as no cascade can result from motions with no internal degrees of freedom. We verify the prediction for the size of the LANS attractor resulting from this scaling. From this, we give a methodology either for arriving at grid-independent solutions for LANS, or for obtaining a formulation of a LES optimal in the context of the alpha models. The fully converged grid-independent LANS may not be the best approximation to a direct numerical simulation of the NS equations since the minimum error is a balance between truncation errors and the approximation error due to using LANS instead of the primitive equations. Furthermore, the small-scale behavior of LANS contributes to a reduction of flux at constant energy, leading to a shallower energy spectrum for large alpha. These small-scale features, do not preclude LANS to reproduce correctly the intermittency properties of high Re flow. ",0,0
"The cosmic abundance of the 3-He isotope has important implications for many fields of astrophysics. We are using the 8.665 GHz hyperfine transition of 3-He+ to determine the 3-He/H abundance in Milky Way HII regions and planetary nebulae. This is one in a series of papers in which we discuss issues involved in deriving accurate 3-He/H abundance ratios from the available measurements. Here we describe the ionization correction we use to convert the 3-He+/H+ abundance, y3+, to the 3-He/H abundance, y3. In principle the nebular ionization structure can significantly influence the y3 derived for individual sources. We find that in general there is insufficient information available to make a detailed ionization correction. Here we make a simple correction and assess its validity. The correction is based on radio recombination line measurements of H+ and 4-He+, together with simple core-halo source models. We use these models to establish criteria that allow us to identify sources that can be accurately corrected for ionization and those that cannot. We argue that this effect cannot be very large for most of the sources in our observational sample. For a wide range of models of nebular ionization structure we find that the ionization correction factor varies from 1 to 1.8. Although large corrections are possible, there would have to be a conspiracy between the density and ionization structure for us to underestimate the ionization correction by a substantial amount.

"The resonant state of the open quantum system is studied from the viewpoint of the outgoing momentum flux. We show that the number of particles is conserved for a resonant state, if we use an expanding volume of integration in order to take account of the outgoing momentum flux; the number of particles would decay exponentially in a fixed volume of integration. Moreover, we introduce new numerical methods of treating the resonant state with the use of the effective potential. We first give a numerical method of finding a resonance pole in the complex energy plane. The method seeks an energy eigenvalue iteratively. We found that our method leads to a super-convergence, the convergence exponential with respect to the iteration step. The present method is completely independent of commonly used complex scaling. We also give a numerical trick for computing the time evolution of the resonant state in a limited spatial area. Since the wave function of the resonant state is diverging away from the scattering potential, it has been previously difficult to follow its time evolution numerically in a finite area. ",0,0
"On the basis of the nonisometric transformations subgroup of the SO(4.2) group, the nonlinear time inhomogeneity one-parameter conformal transformations are constructed. The connection between the group parameter and the Hubble constant H0 is established. It is shown that the existence of an anomalous blue-shifted frequency drift is a pure kinematic manifestation of the time inhomogeneity induced by the Universe expansion. This conclusion is confirmed via a generalization of the standard Special Relativity clock synchronization procedure to the space expanding case. The obtained formulae are in accordance with the observable Pioneer Anomaly effect. The anomalous blue-shifted drift is universal, does not depend on the presence of graviting centers and can be, in principle, observed on any frequencies under suitable experimental conditions. The explicit analytic expression for the speed of recession–intergalactic distance ratio is obtained in the form of a function of the red shift z valid in the whole range of its variation. In the small z limit this expression exactly reproduces the Hubble law. The maximum value of this function at z=0.475 quantitatively corresponds to the experimentally found value z(exp) = 0.46 +/- 0.13 of the transition from the decelerated to the accelerated expansion of the Universe.

"In this paper, we model a nonlinear dynamics of infectious diseases transfer. Particularly, we study possible applications to tubercular infection in models with different profiles (peak values) of the population density dependence on spatial coordinates. Our approach is based on the well known method of instantons which has been used by the authors to describe kinetics of adiabatic chemical reactions as a function of the heat-bath temperature and other system parameters. In our approach, we use 'social temperature' T as one of the controlling parameters. Increase of T leads to acceleration of the infectious diseases transfer. The 'blockage' effect for the infectious diseases transfer has been demonstrated in the case when peak values (in the population density) are equal to one and under condition that the 'social temperature' is low. Existence of such effect essentially depends from environment 'activity' (social and prophylactic). Results of our modeling qualitatively meet the tuberculosis dynamic spread data in Penza region of Russia. ",0,0
"The Variable Star One-shot Project (VSOP) is aimed at (1) providing the variability type and spectral type of all unstudied variable stars, (2) process, publish, and make the data available as automatically as possible, and (3) generate serendipitous discoveries. This first paper describes the project itself, the acquisition of the data, the dataflow, the spectroscopic analysis and the on-line availability of the fully calibrated and reduced data. We also present the results on the 221 stars observed during the first semester of the project. We used the high-resolution echelle spectrographs HARPS and FEROS in the ESO La Silla Observatory (Chile) to survey known variable stars. Once reduced by the dedicated pipelines, the radial velocities are determined from cross correlation with synthetic template spectra, and the spectral types are determined by an automatic minimum distance matching to synthetic spectra, with traditional manual spectral typing cross-checks. The variability types are determined by manually evaluating the available light curves and the spectroscopy. In the future, a new automatic classifier, currently being developed by members of the VSOP team, based on these spectroscopic data and on the photometric classifier developed for the COROT and Gaia space missions, will be used. We confirm or revise spectral types of 221 variable stars from the GCVS. We identify 26 previously unknown multiple systems, among them several visual binaries with spectroscopic binary individual components.

"A synfire chain is a simple neural network model which can propagate stable synchronous spikes called a pulse packet and widely researched. However how synfire chains coexist in one network remains to be elucidated. We have studied the activity of a layered associative network of Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neurons in which connection we embed memory patterns by the Hebbian Learning. We analyzed their activity by the Fokker-Planck method. In our previous report, when a half of neurons belongs to each memory pattern (memory pattern rate F=0.5), the temporal profiles of the network activity is split into temporally clustered groups called sublattices under certain input conditions. In this study, we show that when the network is sparsely connected (F<0.5), synchronous firings of the memory pattern are promoted. On the contrary, the densely connected network (F>0.5) inhibit synchronous firings. The sparseness and denseness also effect the basin of attraction and the storage capacity of the embedded memory patterns. We show that the sparsely(densely) connected networks enlarge(shrink) the basion of attraction and increase(decrease) the storage capacity. ",0,0
"We study cascading failures in networks using a dynamical flow model based on simple conservation and distribution laws to investigate the impact of transient dynamics caused by the rebalancing of loads after an initial network failure (triggering event). It is found that considering the flow dynamics may imply reduced network robustness compared to previous static overload failure models. This is due to the transient oscillations or overshooting in the loads, when the flow dynamics adjusts to the new (remaining) network structure. We obtain upper and lower limits to network robustness, and it is shown that two time scales τ and τ_0, defined by the network dynamics, are important to consider prior to accurately addressing network robustness or vulnerability. The robustness of networks showing cascading failures is generally determined by a complex interplay between the network topology and flow dynamics, where the ratio χ=τ/τ_0 determines the relative role of the two of them.

"The continuum intensity at wavelengths around 1 mm provides an excellent way to probe the solar chromosphere. Future high-resolution millimetre arrays, such as the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), will thus produce valuable input for the ongoing controversy on the thermal structure and the dynamics of this layer. Synthetic brightness temperature maps are calculated on basis of three-dimensional radiation (magneto-)hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. While the millimetre continuum at 0.3mm originates mainly from the upper photosphere, the longer wavelengths considered here map the low and middle chromosphere. The effective formation height increases generally with wavelength and also from disk-centre towards the solar limb. The average intensity contribution functions are usually rather broad and in some cases they are even double-peaked as there are contributions from hot shock waves and cool post-shock regions in the model chromosphere. Taking into account the deviations from ionisation equilibrium for hydrogen gives a less strong variation of the electron density and with it of the optical depth. The result is a narrower formation height range. The average brightness temperature increases with wavelength and towards the limb. The relative contrast depends on wavelength in the same way as the average intensity but decreases towards the limb. The dependence of the brightness temperature distribution on wavelength and disk-position can be explained with the differences in formation height and the variation of temperature fluctuations with height in the model atmospheres.

"In this paper, we model the evolution and self-assembly of randomly oriented carbon nanotubes (CNTs), grown on a metallic substrate in the form of a thin film for field emission under diode configuration. Despite high output, the current in such a thin film device often decays drastically. The present paper is focused on understanding this problem. A systematic, multiphysics based modelling approach is proposed. First, a nucleation coupled model for degradation of the CNT thin film is derived, where the CNTs are assumed to decay by fragmentation and formation of clusters. The random orientation of the CNTs and the electromechanical interaction are then modeled to explain the self-assembly. The degraded state of the CNTs and the electromechanical force are employed to update the orientation of the CNTs. Field emission current at the device scale is finally obtained by using the Fowler-Nordheim equation and integration over the computational cell surfaces on the anode side. The simulated results are in close agreement with the experimental results. Based on the developed model, numerical simulations aimed at understanding the effects of various geometric parameters and their statistical features on the device current history are reported. ",0,0
"The abundance evolution of interstellar dust species originating from stellar sources and from condensation in molecular clouds in the local interstellar medium of the Milky Way is studied and the input of dust material to the Solar System is determined. A one-zone chemical evolution model of the Milky Way for the elemental composition of the disk combined with an evolution model for its interstellar dust component similar to that of Dwek (1998) is developed. The dust model considers dust-mass return from AGB stars as calculated from synthetic AGB models combined with models for dust condensation in stellar outflows. Supernova dust formation is included in a simple parameterized form which is gauged by observed abundances of presolar dust grains with supernova origin. For dust growth in the ISM a simple method is developed for coupling this with disk and dust evolution models. The time evolution of the abundance of the following dust species is followed in the model: silicate, carbon, silicon carbide, and iron dust from AGB stars and from SNe as well as silicate, carbon, and iron dust grown in molecular clouds. It is shown that the interstellar dust population is dominated by dust accreted in molecular clouds; most of the dust material entering the Solar System at its formation does not show isotopic abundance anomalies of the refractory elements, i.e., inconspicuous isotopic abundances do not point to a Solar System origin of dust grains. The observed abundance ratios of presolar dust grains formed in SN ejecta and in AGB star outflows requires that for the ejecta from SNe the fraction of refractory elements condensed into dust is 0.15 for carbon dust and is quite small (∼10^-4) for other dust species.

"Electron-electron interactions play a major role in determining the low-temperature rate of phase loss of electrons in mesoscopic systems. The study of the dephasing rate is expected to contribute to the understanding of the many-body nature of such systems. Closed quantum dots are of special interest in this respect, due to theoretical predictions suggesting a possible transition temperature below which the dephasing rate vanishes. This prediction has attracted much attention, since closed quantum dots are prime candidates for storage units in quantum computers, and thus their phase coherence properties are of great importance. However, an effective method for measuring the dephasing rate within a closed quantum dot is still lacking. Here we study two-level systems and show that the Fano factor has a sharp peak as a function of the chemical potential, the location of which can be simply related to the dephasing rate. We thus suggest to use the properties of the Fano factor peak in the super-Poissonian regime as a probe for the dephasing rate. ",0,0
"We consider an unambiguous identification of an unknown coherent state with one of two unknown coherent reference states. Specifically, we consider two modes of an electromagnetic field prepared in unknown coherent states alpha_1 and alpha_2, respectively. The third mode is prepared either in the state alpha_1 or in the state alpha_2. The task is to identify (unambiguously) which of the two modes are in the same state. We present a scheme consisting of three beamsplitters capable to perform this task. Although we don't prove the optimality, we show that the performance of the proposed setup is better than the generalization of the optimal measurement known for a finite-dimensional case. We show that a single beamsplitter is capable to perform an unambiguous quantum state comparison for coherent states optimally. Finally we propose an experimental setup consisting of 2N-1 beamsplitters for unambiguous identification among N unknown coherent states. This setup can be considered as a search in a quantum database. The elements of the database are unknown coherent states encoded in different modes of an electromagnetic field. The task is to specify the two modes that are excited in the same, though unknown, coherent state. ",0,0
"A space-based gravitational microlensing exoplanet survey will provide a statistical census of exoplanets with masses down to 0.1 Earth-masses and orbital separations ranging from 0.5AU to infinity. This includes analogs to all the Solar System's planets except for Mercury, as well as most types of planets predicted by planet formation theories. Such a survey will provide results on the frequency of planets around all types of stars except those with short lifetimes. Close-in planets with separations < 0.5 AU are invisible to a space-based microlensing survey, but these can be found by Kepler. Other methods, including ground-based microlensing, cannot approach the comprehensive statistics on the mass and semi-major axis distribution of extrasolar planets that a space-based microlensing survey will provide. The terrestrial planet sensitivity of a ground-based microlensing survey is limited to the vicinity of the Einstein radius at 2-3 AU, and space-based imaging is needed to identify and determine the mass of the planetary host stars for the vast majority of planets discovered by microlensing. Thus, a space-based microlensing survey is likely to be the only way to gain a comprehensive understanding of the nature of planetary systems, which is needed to understand planet formation and habitability. The proposed Microlensing Planet Finder (MPF) mission is an example of a space-based microlensing survey that can accomplish these objectives with proven technology and a cost that fits comfortably under the NASA Discovery Program cost cap.

"We search for galaxy counterparts to damped Lyman-alpha absorbers (DLAs) at z>2 towards nine quasars, which have 14 DLAs and 8 sub-DLAs in their spectra. We use integral field spectroscopy to search for Ly-alpha emission line objects at the redshifts of the absorption systems. Besides recovering two previously confirmed objects, we find six statistically significant candidate Ly-alpha emission line objects. The candidates are identified as having wavelengths close to the DLA line where the background quasar emission is absorbed. In comparison with the six currently known Ly-alpha emitting DLA galaxies the candidates have similar line fluxes and line widths, while velocity offsets between the emission lines and systemic DLA redshifts are larger. The impact parameters are larger than 10 kpc, and lower column density systems are found at larger impact parameters. Assuming that a single gas cloud extends from the QSO line of sight to the location of the candidate emission line, we find that the average candidate DLA galaxy is surrounded by neutral gas with an exponential scale length of5 kpc.

"This work reports a theoretical study of the gas phase unimolecular decomposition of cyclobutane, cyclopentane and cyclohexane by means of quantum chemical calculations. A biradical mechanism has been envisaged for each cycloalkane, and the main routes for the decomposition of the biradicals formed have been investigated at the CBS-QB3 level of theory. Thermochemical data (δH^0_f, S^0, C^0_p) for all the involved species have been obtained by means of isodesmic reactions. The contribution of hindered rotors has also been included. Activation barriers of each reaction have been analyzed to assess the 1 energetically most favorable pathways for the decomposition of biradicals. Rate constants have been derived for all elementary reactions using transition state theory at 1 atm and temperatures ranging from 600 to 2000 K. Global rate constant for the decomposition of the cyclic alkanes in molecular products have been calculated. Comparison between calculated and experimental results allowed to validate the theoretical approach. An important result is that the rotational barriers between the conformers, which are usually neglected, are of importance in decomposition rate of the largest biradicals. Ring strain energies (RSE) in transition states for ring opening have been estimated and show that the main part of RSE contained in the cyclic reactants is removed upon the activation process. ",0,0
"By combining experimental measurements of the quasiparticle and dynamical magnetic properties of optimally electron-doped Pr_0.88LaCe_0.12CuO_4 with theoretical calculations we demonstrate that the conventional fermiology approach cannot possibly account for the magnetic fluctuations in these materials. In particular, we perform tunneling experiments on the very same sample for which a dynamical magnetic resonance has been reported recently and use photoemission data by others on a similar sample to characterize the fermionic quasiparticle excitations in great detail. We subsequently use this information to calculate the magnetic response within the conventional fermiology framework as applied in a large body of work for the hole-doped superconductors to find a profound disagreement between the theoretical expectations and the measurements: this approach predicts a step-like feature rather than a sharp resonance peak, it underestimates the intensity of the resonance by an order of magnitude, it suggests an unreasonable temperature dependence of the resonance, and most severely, it predicts that most of the spectral weight resides in incommensurate wings which are a key feature of the hole-doped cuprates but have never been observed in the electron-doped counterparts. Our findings strongly suggest that the magnetic fluctuations reflect the quantum-mechanical competition between antiferromagnetic and superconducting orders. ",0,0
"Very recently in arXiv:0705.0303 Alday and Maldacena gave a string theory prescription for computing (all) planar amplitudes in N=4 supersymmetric gauge theory at strong coupling using the AdS/CFT correspondence. These amplitudes are determined by a classical string solution and contain a universal exponential factor involving the action of the classical string. On the gauge theory side, expressions for perturbative amplitudes at strong coupling were previously proposed only for specific helicities of external particles – the maximally helicity violating or MHV amplitudes. These follow from the exponential ansatz of Bern, Dixon and Smirnov for MHV amplitudes in N=4 SYM. In this paper we examine the amplitudes dependence on helicities and particle-types of external states. We consider the prefactor of string amplitudes and give arguments suggesting that the prefactor at strong coupling should be the same as the Yang-Mills tree-level amplitude for the same process. This implies that scattering amplitudes in N=4 SYM simplify dramatically in the strong coupling limit. It follows from our proposal that in this limit all (MHV and non-MHV) n-point amplitudes are given by the (known) tree-level Yang-Mills result times the helicity-independent (and particle-type-independent) universal exponential.

"Massive stars, supernovae (SNe), and long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have a huge impact on their environment. Despite their importance, a comprehensive knowledge of which massive stars produce which SN/GRB is hitherto lacking. We present a brief overview about our knowledge of mass loss in the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram (HRD) covering evolutionary phases of the OB main sequence, the unstable Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) stage, and the Wolf-Rayet (WR) phase. Despite the fact that metals produced by “self-enrichment” in WR atmospheres exceed the initial – host galaxy – metallicity, by orders of magnitude, a particularly strong dependence of the mass-loss rate on the initial metallicity is found for WR stars at sub-solar metallicities (1/10 – 1/100 solar). This provides a significant boost to the collapsar model for GRBs, as it may present a viable mechanism to prevent the loss of angular momentum by stellar winds at low metallicity, whilst strong Galactic WR winds may inhibit GRBs occurring at solar metallicities. Furthermore, we discuss recently reported quasi-sinusoidal modulations in the radio lightcurves of SNe 2001ig and 2003bg. We show that both the sinusoidal behaviour and the recurrence timescale of these modulations are consistent with the predicted mass-loss behaviour of LBVs, and we suggest LBVs may be the progenitors of some core-collapse SNe.

"We study the quantum Hall effect in graphene at filling factors ν= 0 and ν= ±, concentrating on the quantum Hall ferromagnetic regime, within a non-perturbative bosonization formalism. We start by developing a bosonization scheme for electrons with two discrete degrees of freedom (spin-1/2 and pseudospin-1/2) restricted to the lowest Landau level. Three distinct phases are considered, namely the so-called spin-pseudospin, spin, and pseudospin phases. The first corresponds to a quarter-filled (ν=-1) while the others to a half-filled (ν= 0) lowest Landau level. In each case, we show that the elementary neutral excitations can be treated approximately as a set of n-independent kinds of boson excitations. The boson representation of the projected electron density, the spin, pseudospin, and mixed spin-pseudospin density operators are derived. We then apply the developed formalism to the effective continuous model, which includes SU(4) symmetry breaking terms, recently proposed by Alicea and Fisher. For each quantum Hall state, an effective interacting boson model is derived and the dispersion relations of the elementary excitations are analytically calculated. We propose that the charged excitations (quantum Hall skyrmions) can be described as a coherent state of bosons. We calculate the semiclassical limit of the boson model derived from the SU(4) invariant part of the original fermionic Hamiltonian and show that it agrees with the results of Arovas and co-workers for SU(N) quantum Hall skyrmions. We briefly discuss the influence of the SU(4) symmetry breaking terms in the skyrmion energy. ",0,0

We compare these observations to results from a large Monte Carlo simulation of standard solar models, and use the results to constrain the mean molecular weight of the solar core, and the metallicity of the solar convection zone. We find that only a high value of solar metallicity is consistent with the seismic observations. We can determine the mean molecular weight of the solar core to a very high precision, and, dependent on the sequence of Monte Carlo models used, find that the average mean molecular weight in the inner 20",0,0
"In this paper we outline some aspects of nonabelian gauged linear sigma models. First, we review how partial flag manifolds (generalizing Grassmannians) are described physically by nonabelian gauged linear sigma models, paying attention to realizations of tangent bundles and other aspects pertinent to (0,2) models. Second, we review constructions of Calabi-Yau complete intersections within such flag manifolds, and properties of the gauged linear sigma models. We discuss a number of examples of nonabelian GLSM's in which the Kahler phases are not birational, and in which at least one phase is realized in some fashion other than as a complete intersection, extending previous work of Hori-Tong. We also review an example of an abelian GLSM exhibiting the same phenomenon. We tentatively identify the mathematical relationship between such non-birational phases, as examples of Kuznetsov's homological projective duality. Finally, we discuss linear sigma model moduli spaces in these gauged linear sigma models. We argue that the moduli spaces being realized physically by these GLSM's are precisely Quot and hyperquot schemes, as one would expect mathematically. ",0,0
"Capacity improvement from transmitter and receiver cooperation is investigated in a two-transmitter, two-receiver network with phase fading and full channel state information available at all terminals. The transmitters cooperate by first exchanging messages over an orthogonal transmitter cooperation channel, then encoding jointly with dirty paper coding. The receivers cooperate by using Wyner-Ziv compress-and-forward over an analogous orthogonal receiver cooperation channel. To account for the cost of cooperation, the allocation of network power and bandwidth among the data and cooperation channels is studied. It is shown that transmitter cooperation outperforms receiver cooperation and improves capacity over non-cooperative transmission under most operating conditions when the cooperation channel is strong. However, a weak cooperation channel limits the transmitter cooperation rate; in this case receiver cooperation is more advantageous. Transmitter-and-receiver cooperation offers sizable additional capacity gain over transmitter-only cooperation at low SNR, whereas at high SNR transmitter cooperation alone captures most of the cooperative capacity improvement.

"During the epoch of reionization the 21cm signal is sensitive to the scattering rate of the ultraviolet photons, redshifting across the Lyman_alpha resonance. Here we calculate the photon scattering rate profile for a single ultraviolet source. After taking into account previously neglected natural broadening of the resonance line, we find that photons approach the resonance frequency and experience most scatterings at a significantly smaller distance from the source than naively expected r=(dnu/nu_0)(c/H), where dnu=nu-nu_0 is the initial frequency offset, and the discrepancy increases as the initial frequency offset decreases. As a consequence, the scattering rate P(r) drops much faster with increasing distance than the previously assumed 1/r^2 profile. Near the source (r<1Mpc comoving), the scattering rate of photons that redshift into the Ly_alpha resonance converges to P(r) ∝r^-7/3. The scattering rate of Ly_alpha photons produced by splitting of photons that redshift into a higher resonance (Ly_gamma, Ly_delta, etc.) is only weakly affected by the radiative transfer, while the sum of scattering rates of Ly_alpha photons produced from all higher resonances also converges to P(r) ∝r^-7/3 near the source. At 15<z<35, on scales of0.01-20Mpc/h (comoving), the total scattering rate of Ly_alpha photons from all Lyman resonances is found to be higher by a factor of1+0.3[(1+z)/20]^2/3 than obtained without full radiative transfer. Consequently, during the early stage of reionization, the differential brightness of 21cm signal against the cosmic microwave background is also boosted by a similar factor. ",0,0
"We present a deep photometric survey of M31, conducted with the CFHT and INT, covering the inner 50 kpc of the galaxy, the Southern quadrant out to 150 kpc, and extending to M33. This is the first systematic panoramic study of this very outermost region of galaxies. We detect several streams and other large-scale structures, and two new dwarf galaxies: And XV and XVI. The discovery of substructure on the minor axis, together with the fact that the light profile between 0.5 < R < 1.3 follows the exponential “extended disk”, is particularly important in shedding light on the mixed and sometimes conflicting results reported in previous studies. Underlying the substructures lies a faint, metal-poor, smooth and extremely extended halo, reaching out to at least 150 kpc. The smooth halo component in M31 has a profile that can be fit with a Hernquist model of immense scale radius55 kpc, almost a factor of 4 larger than theoretical predictions. Alternatively a power-law with exponent -1.91 +/- 0.11 can be fit to the profile. The total luminosity of this structure is similar to that of the halo of the Milky Way. This vast, smooth, underlying halo is reminiscent of a classical monolithic model and completely unexpected from modern galaxy formation models. M33 is also found to have an extended metal-poor halo component, which can be fit with a Hernquist model also of scale radius55 kpc. These extended slowly-decreasing halos will provide a challenge and strong constraints for further modeling. [Abridged] ",0,0
"We present the results of the analysis of an archival 15 ks XMM-Newton observation of the nearby (z=0.057) radio-loud source 3C445, optically classified as a Broad-Line Radio Galaxy. While the RGS data are of insufficient quality to allow a meaningful analysis, the EPIC data show a remarkable X-ray spectrum. The 2-10 keV continuum is described by a heavily absorbed (Nh1e22 - 1e23 cm-2) power law with photon index Gamma1.4, and strong (R 2) cold reflection. A narrow, unresolved Fe Kalpha emission line is detected, confirming previous findings, with EW 120eV. A soft excess is present below 2 keV over the extrapolation of the hard X-ray power law, which we model with a power law with the same photon index as the hard power law, absorbed by a column density Nh=6e20 cm-2 in excess to Galactic. A host of emission lines are present below 2 keV, confirming previous indications from ASCA, due to H- and He-like O, Mg, and Si. We attribute the origin of the lines to a photoionized gas, with properties very similar to radio-quiet obscured AGN. Two different ionized media, or a single stratified medium, are required to fit the soft X-ray data satisfactorily. The similarity of the X-ray spectrum of 3C445 to Seyferts underscores that the central engines of radio-loud and radio-quiet AGN similarly host both cold and warm gas. ",0,0
"We present a method to construct semi-numerical “simulations”, which can efficiently generate realizations of halo distributions and ionization maps at high redshifts. Our procedure combines an excursion-set approach with first-order Lagrangian perturbation theory and operates directly on the linear density and velocity fields. As such, the achievable dynamic range with our algorithm surpasses the current practical limit of N-body codes by orders of magnitude. This is particularly significant in studies of reionization, where the dynamic range is the principal limiting factor. We test our halo-finding and HII bubble-finding algorithms independently against N-body simulations with radiative transfer and obtain excellent agreement. We compute the size distributions of ionized and neutral regions in our maps. We find even larger ionized bubbles than do purely analytic models at the same volume-weighted mean hydrogen neutral fraction. We also generate maps and power spectra of 21-cm brightness temperature fluctuations, which for the first time include corrections due to gas bulk velocities. We find that velocities widen the tails of the temperature distributions and increase small-scale power, though these effects quickly diminish as reionization progresses. We also include some preliminary results from a simulation run with the largest dynamic range to date: a 250 Mpc box that resolves halos with masses M >2.2 x10^8 M_sun. We show that accurately modeling the late stages of reionization requires such large scales. The speed and dynamic range provided by our semi-numerical approach will be extremely useful in the modeling of early structure formation and reionization. ",0,0
"We present the mid-infrared spectrum, obtained with the Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph (IRS), of HD 98800, a quadruple star system located in the 10-Myr-old TW Hydrae association. It has a known mid-infrared excess that arises from a circumbinary disk around the B components of the system. The IRS spectrum confirms that the disk around HD 98800 B displays no excess emission below about 5.5 micron, implying an optically thick disk wall at 5.9 AU and an inner, cleared-out region; however, some optically thin dust, consisting mainly of 3-micron-sized silicate dust grains, orbits the binary in a ring between 1.5 and 2 AU. The peculiar structure and apparent lack of gas in the HD 98800 B disk suggests that this system is likely already at the debris disks stage, with a tidally truncated circumbinary disk of larger dust particles and an inner, second-generation dust ring, possibly held up by the resonances of a planet. The unusually large infrared excess can be explained by gravitational perturbations of the Aa+Ab pair puffing up the outer dust ring and causing frequent collisions among the larger particles. ",0,0
"The nature of the coupling leading to superconductivity in layered materials such as high-Tc superconductors and graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) is still unresolved. In both systems, interactions of electrons with either phonons or other electrons or both have been proposed to explain superconductivity. In the high-Tc cuprates, the presence of a Van Hove singularity (VHS) in the density of states near the Fermi level was long ago proposed to enhance the many-body couplings and therefore may play a role in superconductivity. Such a singularity can cause an anisotropic variation in the coupling strength, which may partially explain the so-called nodal-antinodal dichotomy in the cuprates. Here we show that the topology of the graphene band structure at dopings comparable to the GICs is quite similar to that of the cuprates and that the quasiparticle dynamics in graphene have a similar dichotomy. Namely, the electron-phonon coupling is highly anisotropic, diverging near a saddle point in the graphene electronic band structure. These results support the important role of the VHS in layered materials and the possible optimization of Tc by tuning the VHS with respect to the Fermi level. ",0,0

"Using high-resolution UV spectra of 16 low-z QSOs, we study the physical conditions and statistics of O VI absorption in the IGM at z < 0.5.

The lower proximate ratios could be partially due to ionization effects but also require higher metallicities. We find that 37",0,0
"We model the evolution of protoplanetary disks surrounding millisecond pulsars, using PSR 1257+12 as a test case. Initial conditions were chosen to correspond to initial angular momenta expected for supernova-fallback disks and disks formed from the tidal disruption of a companion star. Models were run under two models for the viscous evolution of disks: fully viscous and layered accretion disk models. Supernova-fallback disks result in a distribution of solids confined to within 1-2 AU and produce the requisite material to form the three known planets surrounding PSR 1257+12. Tidal disruption disks tend to slightly underproduce solids interior to 1 AU, required for forming the pulsar planets, while overproducing the amount of solids where no body, lunar mass or greater, exists. Disks evolving under 'layered' accretion spread somewhat less and deposit a higher column density of solids into the disk. In all cases, circumpulsar gas dissipates on ≲ 10^5 year timescales, making formation of gas giant planets highly unlikely. ",0,0
"Random walks on expander graphs were thoroughly studied, with the important motivation that, under some natural conditions, these walks mix quickly and provide an efficient method of sampling the vertices of a graph. Alon, Benjamini, Lubetzky and Sodin studied non-backtracking random walks on regular graphs, and showed that their mixing rate may be up to twice as fast as that of the simple random walk. As an application, they showed that the maximal number of visits to a vertex, made by a non-backtracking random walk of length n on a high-girth n-vertex regular expander, is typically (1+o(1))log n/loglog n, as in the case of the balls and bins experiment. They further asked whether one can establish the precise distribution of the visits such a walk makes.In this work, we answer the above question by combining a generalized form of Brun's sieve with some extensions of the ideas in Alon et al. Let N_t denote the number of vertices visited precisely t times by a non-backtracking random walk of length n on a regular n-vertex expander of fixed degree and girth g. We prove that if g=ω(1), then for any fixed t, N_t/n is typically 1/et!+o(1). Furthermore, if g=Ω(loglog n), then N_t/n is typically 1+o(1)/et! uniformly on all t ≤ (1-o(1))log n/loglog n and 0 for all t ≥ (1+o(1))log n/loglog n. In particular, we obtain the above result on the typical maximal number of visits to a single vertex, with an improved threshold window. The essence of the proof lies in showing that variables counting the number of visits to a set of sufficiently distant vertices are asymptotically independent Poisson variables. ",0,0
"We investigate the phenomenology of the Randall-Sundrum radion in realistic models of electroweak symmetry breaking with bulk gauge and fermion fields, since the radion may turn out to be the lightest particle in such models. We calculate the coupling of the radion in such scenarios to bulk fermion and gauge modes. Special attention needs to be devoted to the coupling to massless gauge fields (photon, gluon), since it is well known that loop effects may be important for these fields. We also present a detailed explanation of these couplings from the CFT interpretation. We then use these couplings to determine the radion branching fractions and discuss some of the discovery potential of the LHC for the radion. We find that the gamma-gamma signal is enhanced over most of the range of the radion mass over the gamma-gamma signal of a SM Higgs, as long as the RS scale is sufficiently low. However, the signal significance depends strongly on free parameters that characterize the magnitude of bare brane-localized kinetic terms for the massless gauge fields. In the absence of such terms, the signal can be be enhanced over the traditional RS1 models (where all standard model fields are localized on the IR brane), but the signal can also be reduced compared to RS1 if the brane localized terms are sizeable. We also show that for larger radion masses, where the gamma-gamma signal is no longer significant, one can use the usual 4 lepton signal to discover the radion. ",0,0
"We report on 8.4GHz Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations of the type II-P supernova SN2004et in the spiral galaxy NGC 6946, made on 20 February 2005 (151 days after explosion). The Very Large Array (VLA) flux density was 1.23±0.07 mJy, corresponding to an isotropic luminosity at 8.4GHz of (4.45±0.3)×10^25 erg s^-1 Hz^-1 and a brightness temperature of (1.3±0.3)×10^8 K. We also provide an improved source position, accurate to about 0.5 mas in each coordinate. The VLBI image shows a clear asymmetry. From model fitting of the size of the radio emission, we estimate a minimum expansion velocity of 15,700±2,000 km s^-1. This velocity is more than twice the expected mean expansion velocity estimated from a synchrotron self-absorbed emission model, thus suggesting that synchrotron self-absorption is not relevant for this supernova. With the benefit of an optical spectrum obtained 12 days after explosion, we favor an emission model which consists of two hot spots on an underlying expanding shell of width comparable to that of SN 1993J.

"We investigate faint radio emission from low- to high-luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Their radio properties are inferred by co-adding large ensembles of radio image cut-outs from the FIRST survey, as almost all of the sources are individually undetected. We correlate the median radio flux densities against a range of other sample properties, including median values for redshift, [OIII] luminosity, emission line ratios, and the strength of the 4000A break. We detect a strong trend for sources that are actively undergoing star-formation to have excess radio emission beyond the10^28 ergs/s/Hz level found for sources without any discernible star-formation. Furthermore, this additional radio emission correlates well with the strength of the 4000A break in the optical spectrum, and may be used to assess the age of the star-forming component. We examine two subsamples, one containing the systems with emission line ratios most like star-forming systems, and one with the sources that have characteristic AGN ratios. This division also separates the mechanism responsible for the radio emission (star-formation vs. AGN). For both cases we find a strong, almost identical, correlation between [OIII] and radio luminosity, with the AGN sample extending toward lower, and the star-formation sample toward higher luminosities. A clearer separation between the two subsamples is seen as function of the central velocity dispersion of the host galaxy. For systems with similar redshifts and velocity dispersions, the star-formation subsample is brighter than the AGN in the radio by an order of magnitude. This underlines the notion that the radio emission in star-forming systems can dominate the emission associated with the AGN. ",0,0

"We derive general conditions for 100 percent frequency conversion in any doubly resonant nonlinear cavity, for both second- and third-harmonic generation via chi2 and chi3 nonlinearities. We find that conversion efficiency is optimized for a certain critical power depending on the cavity parameters, and assuming reasonable parameters we predict 100 percent conversion using milliwatts of power or less. These results follow from a semi-analytical coupled-mode theory framework which is generalized from previous work to include both chi2 and chi3 media as well as inhomogeneous (fully vectorial) cavities, analyzed in the high-efficiency limit where down-conversion processes lead to a maximum efficiency at the critical power, and which is verified by direct finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations of the nonlinear Maxwell equations. Explicit formulas for the nonlinear coupling coefficients are derived in terms of the linear cavity eigenmodes, which can be used to design and evaluate cavities in arbitrary geometries. ",0,0
"The electronic density of states of graphene is equivalent to that of relativistic electrons. In the absence of disorder or external doping the Fermi energy lies at the Dirac point where the density of states vanishes. Although transport measurements at high carrier densities indicate rather high mobilities, many questions pertaining to disorder remain unanswered. In particular, it has been argued theoretically, that when the average carrier density is zero, the inescapable presence of disorder will lead to electron and hole puddles with equal probability. In this work, we use a scanning single electron transistor to image the carrier density landscape of graphene in the vicinity of the neutrality point. Our results clearly show the electron-hole puddles expected theoretically. In addition, our measurement technique enables to determine locally the density of states in graphene. In contrast to previously studied massive two dimensional electron systems, the kinetic contribution to the density of states accounts quantitatively for the measured signal. Our results suggests that exchange and correlation effects are either weak or have canceling contributions. ",0,0
"We carried out low resolution spectroscopic observations in the wavelength range 3400-4700 A of 20 He-weak and 8 He-strong stars to determine their fundamental parameters by means of the Divan-Chalonge-Barbier (BCD) spectrophotometric system. For a few He-weak stars we also estimate the effective temperatures and the angular diameters by integrating absolute fluxes observed over a wide spectral range. Non-LTE model calculations are carried out to study the influence of the He/H abundance ratio on the emergent radiation of He-strong stars and on their Teff determination. We find that the effective temperatures, surface gravities and bolometric absolute magnitudes of He-weak stars estimated with the BCD system and the integrated flux method are in good agreement between each other, and they also agree with previous determinations based on several different methods. The mean discrepancy between the visual absolute magnitudes derived using the Hipparcos parallaxes and the BCD values is on average 0.3 mag for He-weak stars, while it is 0.5 mag for He-strong stars. For He-strong stars, we note that the BCD calibration, based on stars in the solar environment, leads to overestimated values of Teff. By means of model atmosphere calculations with enhanced He/H abundance ratios we show that larger He/H ratios produce smaller BD which naturally explains the Teff overestimation. We take advantage of these calculations to introduce a method to estimate the He/H abundance ratio in He-strong stars. The BD of HD 37479 suggests that the Teff of this star remains fairly constant as the star spectrum undergoes changes in the intensity of H and He absorption lines. Data for the He-strong star HD 66765 are reported for the first time. ",0,0
"Aims: The planetary system around the M star Gliese 581 consists of a hot Neptune (Gl 581b) and two super-Earths (Gl 581c and Gl 581d). The habitability of this system with respect to the super-Earths is investigated following a concept that studies the long-term possibility of photosynthetic biomass production on a dynamically active planet. Methods: A thermal evolution model for a super-Earth is used to calculate the sources and sinks of atmospheric carbon dioxide. The habitable zone is determined by the limits of biological productivity on the planetary surface. Models with different ratios of land / ocean coverage are investigated. Results: The super-Earth Gl 581c is clearly outside the habitable zone, since it is too close to the star. In contrast, Gl 581d is a tidally locked habitable super-Earth near the outer edge of the habitable zone.

"In contrast to the Euler-Poincaré reduction of geodesic flows of left- or right-invariant metrics on Lie groups to the corresponding Lie algebra (or its dual), one can consider the reduction of the geodesic flows to the group itself. The reduced vector field has a remarkable hydrodynamic interpretation: it is a velocity field for a stationary flow of an ideal fluid. Right- or left-invariant symmetry fields of the reduced field define vortex manifolds for such flows.Consider now a mechanical system, whose configuration space is a Lie group and whose Lagrangian is invariant to left translations on that group, and assume that the mass geometry of the system may change under the action of internal control forces. Such system can also be reduced to the Lie group. With no controls, this mechanical system describes a geodesic flow of the left-invariant metric, given by the Lagrangian, and thus its reduced flow is a stationary ideal fluid flow on the Lie group. The standard control problem for such system is to find the conditions, under which the system can be brought from any initial position in the configuration space to another preassigned position by changing its mass geometry. We show that under these conditions, by changing the mass geometry, one can also bring one vortex manifold to any other preassigned vortex manifold. ",0,0
"A generalized twistor transform for spinning particles in 3+1 dimensions is constructed that beautifully unifies many types of spinning systems by mapping them to the same twistor, thus predicting an infinite set of duality relations among spinning systems with different Hamiltonians. Usual 1T-physics is not equipped to explain the duality relationships and unification between these systems. We use 2T-physics in 4+2 dimensions to uncover new properties of twistors, and expect that our approach will prove to be useful for practical applications as well as for a deeper understanding of fundamental physics. Unexpected structures for a new description of spinning particles emerge. A unifying symmetry SU(2,3) that includes conformal symmetry SU(2,2)=SO(4,2) in the massless case, turns out to be a fundamental property underlying the dualities of a large set of spinning systems, including those that occur in high spin theories. This may lead to new forms of string theory backgrounds as well as to new methods for studying various corners of M theory. In this paper we present the main concepts, and in a companion paper we give other details. ",0,0
"In the extra U(1) superstring inspired model, we examine the electroweak and U(1)-prime symmetry breaking with the singlet and exotic quark D, D+along with the study of heavy Z-prime boson in accordance with the top quark mass region. For this, we have done the analysis of complete renormalization group equations (RGEs)pertaining to the anomaly free E--Eta model of rank 5. The Z-prime is found to the order of TeV or above with allowed small Z-Zprime mixing angle, for which the large singlet VEV is required. This is done by considering the only non-universality of Yukawa couplings at GUT scale because these do not obey the E-relationship and also satisfies the unitarity constraints both at GUT and weak scale, where rest of the parameters, i.e., gaugino masses, tri-linear couplings, and soft supersymmetric breaking masses are kept universal at GUT scale with the gauge couplings unification. The large value of Yukawa couplings (order of 1) triggered the symmetry breaking radiatively and induces the effective-Mu parameter at the electroweak scale and lead to a viable low energy spectrum at weak scale.

"Time variability of the solar neutrino flux especially in the low and intermediate energy sector remains an open question and, if it exists, it is likely to be originated from the magnetic moment transition from active to light sterile neutrinos at times of intense solar activity and magnetic field. We examine the prospects for the SNO+ experiment to address this important issue and to distinguish between the two classes of solar models which are currently identified as corresponding to a high (SSM I) and a low (SSM II) heavy element abundance. We also evaluate the predictions from these two models for the Chlorine experiment event rate in the standard LMA and LMA+Spin Flavour Precession (SFP) scenarios. It is found that after three years of SNO+ data taking, the pep flux measurement will be able to discriminate between the standard LMA and LMA+SFP scenarios, independently of which is the correct solar model. If the LMA rate is measured, SFP with B_0 ∼ 280kG for the resonant Δ m^2_01 can be excluded at more than 4σ. A low rate would signal new physics, excluding all the 90",0,0
"Production of a sterile species is studied within an effective model of active-sterile neutrino mixing in a medium in thermal equilibrium. The quantum kinetic equations for the distribution functions and coherences are obtained from two independent methods: the effective action and the quantum master equation. The decoherence time scale for active-sterile oscillations is τ_dec = 2/Γ_aa, but the evolution of the distribution functions is determined by the two different time scales associated with the damping rates of the quasiparticle modes in the medium: Γ_1=Γ_aacos^2 ; Γ_2=Γ_aasin^2 where Γ_aa is the interaction rate of the active species in absence of mixing andthe mixing angle in the medium. These two time scales are widely different away from MSW resonances and preclude the kinetic description of active-sterile production in terms of a simple rate equation. We give the complete set of quantum kinetic equations for the active and sterile populations and coherences and discuss in detail the various approximations. A generalization of the active-sterile transition probability in a medium is provided via the quantum master equation. We derive explicitly the usual quantum kinetic equations in terms of the “polarization vector” and show their equivalence to those obtained from the quantum master equation and effective action.

"This note relates topics in statistical mechanics, graph theory and combinatorics, lattice quantum field theory, super quantum mechanics and string theory. We give a precise relation between the dimer model on a graph embedded on a torus and the massless free Majorana fermion living on the same lattice. A loop expansion of the fermion determinant is performed, where the loops turn out to be compositions of two perfect matchings. These loop states are sorted into co-chain groups using categorification techniques similar to the ones used for categorifying knot polynomials. The Euler characteristic of the resulting co-chain complex recovers the Newton polynomial of the dimer model. We re-interpret this system as supersymmetric quantum mechanics, where configurations with vanishing net winding number form the ground states. Finally, we make use of the quiver gauge theory - dimer model correspondence to obtain an interpretation of the loops in terms of the physics of D-branes probing a toric Calabi-Yau singularity. ",0,0
"In wireless ad hoc networks, distributed nodes can collaboratively form an antenna array for long-distance communications to achieve high energy efficiency. In recent work, Ochiai, et al., have shown that such collaborative beamforming can achieve a statistically nice beampattern with a narrow main lobe and low sidelobes. However, the process of collaboration introduces significant delay, since all collaborating nodes need access to the same information. In this paper, a technique that significantly reduces the collaboration overhead is proposed. It consists of two phases. In the first phase, nodes transmit locally in a random access fashion. Collisions, when they occur, are viewed as linear mixtures of the collided packets. In the second phase, a set of cooperating nodes acts as a distributed antenna system and beamform the received analog waveform to one or more faraway destinations. This step requires multiplication of the received analog waveform by a complex number, which is independently computed by each cooperating node, and which enables separation of the collided packets based on their final destination. The scheme requires that each node has global knowledge of the network coordinates. The proposed scheme can achieve high throughput, which in certain cases exceeds one. ",0,0
"Given an abelian algebraic group A over a global field F, α∈ A(F), and a prime ℓ, the set of all preimages of α under some iterate of [ℓ] generates an extension of F that contains all ℓ-power torsion points as well as a Kummer-type extension. We analyze the Galois group of this extension, and for several classes of A we give a simple characterization of when the Galois group is as large as possible up to constraints imposed by the endomorphism ring or the Weil pairing. This Galois group encodes information about the density of primesin the ring of integers of F such that the order of (α) is prime to ℓ. We compute this density in the general case for several classes of A, including elliptic curves and one-dimensional tori. For example, if F is a number field, A/F is an elliptic curve with surjective 2-adic representation and α∈ A(F) with α∉2A(F(A[4])), then the density of 𝔭 with (α) having odd order is 11/21. ",0,0
"Most industrial machine tools have a serial kinematic architecture, which means that each axis has to carry the following one, including its actuators and joints. High Speed Machining highlights some drawbacks of such architectures: heavy moving parts require from the machine structure high stiffness to limit bending problems that lower the machine accuracy, and limit the dynamic performances of the feed axes. That is why PKMs attract more and more researchers and companies, because they are claimed to offer several advantages over their serial counterparts, like high structural rigidity and high dynamic capacities. Indeed, the parallel kinematic arrangement of the links provides higher stiffness and lower moving masses that reduce inertia effects. Thus, PKMs have better dynamic performances. However, the design of a parallel kinematic machine tool (PKMT) is a hard task that requires further research studies before wide industrial use can be expected. Many criteria need to be taken into account in the design of a PKMT. We pay special attention to the description of kinetostatic criteria that rely on the conditioning of the Jacobian matrix of the mechanism. The organisation of this paper is as follows: next section introduces general remarks about PKMs, then is explained why PKMs can be interesting alternative machine tool designs. Then are presented existing PKMTs. An application to the design of a small-scale machine tool prototype developed at IRCCyN is presented at the end of this paper. ",0,0
"Context. Searching for planets in open clusters allows us to study the effects of dynamical environment on planet formation and evolution.Aims. Considering the strong dependence of planet frequency on stellar metallicity, we studied the metal rich old open cluster NGC 6791 and searched for close-in planets using the transit technique.Methods. A ten-night observational campaign was performed using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (3.6m), the San Pedro Mártir telescope (2.1m), and the Loiano telescope (1.5m). To increase the transit detection probability we also made use of the Bruntt et al. (2003) eight-nights observational campaign. Adequate photometric precision for the detection of planetary transits was achieved.Results. Should the frequency and properties of close-in planets in NGC 6791 be similar to those orbiting field stars of similar metallicity, then detailed simulations foresee the presence of 2-3 transiting planets. Instead, we do not confirm the transit candidates proposed by Bruntt et al. (2003). The probability that the null detection is simply due to chance coincidence is estimated to be 3",0,0
"We analyze a probabilistic cellular automaton describing the dynamics of coexistence of a predator-prey system. The individuals of each species are localized over the sites of a lattice and the local stochastic updating rules are inspired on the processes of the Lotka-Volterra model. Two levels of mean-field approximations are set up. The simple approximation is equivalent to an extended patch model, a simple metapopulation model with patches colonized by prey, patches colonized by predators and empty patches. This approximation is capable of describing the limited available space for species occupancy. The pair approximation is moreover able to describe two types of coexistence of prey and predators: one where population densities are constant in time and another displaying self-sustained time-oscillations of the population densities. The oscillations are associated with limit cycles and arise through a Hopf bifurcation. They are stable against changes in the initial conditions and, in this sense, they differ from the Lotka-Volterra cycles which depend on initial conditions. In this respect, the present model is biologically more realistic than the Lotka-Volterra model. ",0,0
"The peculiar velocity of the Local Group of galaxies manifested in the Cosmic Microwave Background dipole is found to decompose into three dominant components. The three components are clearly separated because they arise on distinct spatial scales and are fortuitously almost orthogonal in their influences. The nearest, which is distinguished by a velocity discontinuity at7 Mpc, arises from the evacuation of the Local Void. We lie in the Local Sheet that bounds the void. Random motions within the Local Sheet are small. Our Galaxy participates in the bulk motion of the Local Sheet away from the Local Void. The component of our motion on an intermediate scale is attributed to the Virgo Cluster and its surroundings, 17 Mpc away. The third and largest component is an attraction on scales larger than 3000 km/s and centered near the direction of the Centaurus Cluster. The amplitudes of the three components are 259, 185, and 455 km/s, respectively, adding collectively to 631 km/s in the reference frame of the Local Sheet. Taking the nearby influences into account causes the residual attributed to large scales to align with observed concentrations of distant galaxies and reduces somewhat the amplitude of motion attributed to their pull. On small scales, in addition to the motion of our Local Sheet away from the Local Void, the nearest adjacent filament, the Leo Spur, is seen to be moving in a direction that will lead to convergence with our filament. Finally, a good distance to an isolated galaxy within the Local Void reveals that this dwarf system has a motion of at least 230 km/s away from the void center. Given the velocities expected from gravitational instability theory in the standard cosmological paradigm, the distance to the center of the Local Void must be at least 23 Mpc from our position. The Local Void is large! ",0,0
"Position determination in biological systems is often achieved through protein concentration gradients. Measuring the local concentration of such a protein with a spatially-varying distribution allows the measurement of position within the system. In order for these systems to work effectively, position determination must be robust to noise. Here, we calculate fundamental limits to the precision of position determination by concentration gradients due to unavoidable biochemical noise perturbing the gradients. We focus on gradient proteins with first order reaction kinetics. Systems of this type have been experimentally characterised in both developmental and cell biology settings. For a single gradient we show that, through time-averaging, great precision can potentially be achieved even with very low protein copy numbers. As a second example, we investigate the ability of a system with oppositely directed gradients to find its centre. With this mechanism, positional precision close to the centre improves more slowly with increasing averaging time, and so longer averaging times or higher copy numbers are required for high precision. For both single and double gradients, we demonstrate the existence of optimal length scales for the gradients, where precision is maximized, as well as analyzing how precision depends on the size of the concentration measuring apparatus. Our results provide fundamental constraints on the positional precision supplied by concentration gradients in various contexts, including both in developmental biology and also within a single cell.

"We provide a new estimate of the local supermassive black hole mass function using (i) the empirical relation between supermassive black hole mass and the Sersic index of the host spheroidal stellar system and (ii) the measured (spheroid) Sersic indices drawn from 10k galaxies in the Millennium Galaxy Catalogue. The observational simplicity of our approach, and the direct measurements of the black hole predictor quantity, i.e. the Sersic index, for both elliptical galaxies and the bulges of disc galaxies makes it straightforward to estimate accurate black hole masses in early- and late-type galaxies alike. We have parameterised the supermassive black hole mass function with a Schechter function and find, at the low-mass end, a logarithmic slope (1+alpha) of0.7 for the full galaxy sample and1.0 for the early-type galaxy sample. Considering spheroidal stellar systems brighter than M_B = -18 mag, and integrating down to black hole masses of 10^6 M_sun, we find that the local mass density of supermassive black holes in early-type galaxies rho_bh, early-type = (3.5+/-1.2) x 10^5 h^3_70 M_sun Mpc^-3, and in late-type galaxies rho_bh, late-type = (1.0+/-0.5) x 10^5 h^3_70 M_sun Mpc^-3. The uncertainties are derived from Monte Carlo simulations which include uncertainties in the M_bh-n relation, the catalogue of Sersic indices, the galaxy weights and Malmquist bias. The combined, cosmological, supermassive black hole mass density is thus Omega_bh, total = (3.2+/-1.2) x 10^-6 h_70. That is, using a new and independent method, we conclude that (0.007+/-0.003) h^3_70 per cent of the universe's baryons are presently locked up in supermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies.

"We present the results of spectroscopy of Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) at z 5 in the J0053+1234 field with the Faint Object Camera and Spectrograph on the Subaru telescope. Among 5 bright candidates with z' < 25.0 mag, 2 objects are confirmed to be at z 5 from their Ly alpha emission and the continuum depression shortward of Ly alpha. The EWs of Ly alpha emission of the 2 LBGs are not so strong to be detected as Ly alpha emitters, and one of them shows strong low-ionized interstellar (LIS) metal absorption lines. Two faint objects with z' ≥25.0 mag are also confirmed to be at z 5, and their spectra show strong Ly alpha emission in contrast to the bright ones. These results suggest a deficiency of strong Ly alpha emission in bright LBGs at z 5, which has been discussed in our previous paper. Combined with our previous spectra of LBGs at z 5 obtained around the Hubble Deep Field-North (HDF-N), we made a composite spectrum of UV luminous (M_1400 ≤-21.5 mag) LBGs at z 5. The resultant spectrum shows a weak Ly alpha emission and strong LIS absorptions which suggests that the bright LBGs at z 5 have chemically evolved at least to0.1 solar metallicity. For a part of our sample in the HDF-N region, we obtained near-to-mid infrared data, which constraint stellar masses of these objects. With the stellar mass and the metallicity estimated from LIS absorptions, the metallicities of the LBGs at z 5 tend to be lower than those of the galaxies with the same stellar mass at z ≲2, although the uncertainty is very large.

"In the past several decades there have been a number of proposals for computing with dual forms of non-abelian Yang-Mills theories on the lattice. Motivated by the gauge-invariant, geometric picture offered by dual models and successful applications of duality in the U(1) case, we revisit the question of whether it is practical to perform numerical computation using non-abelian dual models. Specifically, we consider three-dimensional SU(2) pure Yang-Mills as an accessible yet non-trivial case in which the gauge group is non-abelian. Using methods developed recently in the context of spin foam quantum gravity, we derive an algorithm for efficiently computing the dual amplitude and describe Metropolis moves for sampling the dual ensemble. We relate our algorithms to prior work in non-abelian dual computations of Hari Dass and his collaborators, addressing several problems that have been left open. We report results of spin expectation value computations over a range of lattice sizes and couplings that are in agreement with our conventional lattice computations. We conclude with an outlook on further development of dual methods and their application to problems of current interest. ",0,0
"We show that for a hypersurface Batyrev's stringy E-function can be seen as a residue of the Hodge zeta function, a specialization of the motivic zeta function of Denef and Loeser. This is a nice application of inversion of adjunction. If an affine hypersurface is given by a polynomial that is non-degenerate with respect to its Newton polyhedron, then the motivic zeta function and thus the stringy E-function can be computed from this Newton polyhedron (by work of Artal, Cassou-Nogues, Luengo and Melle based on an algorithm of Denef and Hoornaert). We use this procedure to obtain an easy way to compute the contribution of a Brieskorn singularity to the stringy E-function. As a corollary, we prove that stringy Hodge numbers of varieties with a certain class of strictly canonical Brieskorn singularities are nonnegative. We conclude by computing an interesting 6-dimensional example. It shows that a result, implying nonnegativity of stringy Hodge numbers in lower dimensional cases, obtained in our previous paper, is not true in higher dimension. ",0,0
"We introduce VErsatile SPectral Analysis (VESPA): a new method which aims to recover robust star formation and metallicity histories from galactic spectra. VESPA uses the full spectral range to construct a galaxy history from synthetic models. We investigate the use of an adaptative parametrization grid to recover reliable star formation histories on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis. Our goal is robustness as opposed to high resolution histories, and the method is designed to return high time resolution only where the data demand it. In this paper we detail the method and we present our findings when we apply VESPA to synthetic and real Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopic data. We show that the number of parameters that can be recovered from a spectrum depends strongly on the signal-to-noise, wavelength coverage and presence or absence of a young population. For a typical SDSS sample of galaxies, we can normally recover between 2 to 5 stellar populations. We find very good agreement between VESPA and our previous analysis of the SDSS sample with MOPED.

"This paper includes a reflection on the role of networks in the study of English language acquisition, as well as a collection of practical criteria to annotate free-speech corpora from children utterances. At the theoretical level, the main claim of this paper is that syntactic networks should be interpreted as the outcome of the use of the syntactic machinery. Thus, the intrinsic features of such machinery are not accessible directly from (known) network properties. Rather, what one can see are the global patterns of its use and, thus, a global view of the power and organization of the underlying grammar. Taking a look into more practical issues, the paper examines how to build a net from the projection of syntactic relations. Recall that, as opposed to adult grammars, early-child language has not a well-defined concept of structure. To overcome such difficulty, we develop a set of systematic criteria assuming constituency hierarchy and a grammar based on lexico-thematic relations. At the end, what we obtain is a well defined corpora annotation that enables us i) to perform statistics on the size of structures and ii) to build a network from syntactic relations over which we can perform the standard measures of complexity. We also provide a detailed example. ",0,0
"We have conducted an extensive wide-field imaging survey for Cepheid variables in the Local Group irregular galaxy WLM. From data obtained on 101 nights, we have discovered 60 Cepheids which include 14 of the 15 Cepheid variables previously detected by Sandage and Carlson. Down to a period of 3 days, our Cepheid survey in WLM should be practically complete. Importantly, we have found for the first time a long-period Cepheid (P=54.2 days) in this galaxy, alleviating the puzzle that WLM with its many blue, massive stars does not contain Cepheids with periods longer than about 10 days. Our data define tight period-luminosity relations in V, I and the reddening-free Wesenheit magnitude W_ I which are all extremely well fit by the corresponding slopes of the LMC Cepheid PL relation, suggesting no change of the PL relation slope down to a Cepheid metal abundance of about -1.0 dex, in agreement with other recent studies. We derive a true distance modulus to WLM of 25.144 ±0.03 (r) ±0.07 (s) mag from our data, in good agreement with the earlier 24.92 ± 0.21 mag determination of Lee, Freedman and Madore (1993a) from Cepheid variables.

"We investigated the viability of neutralino dark matter in the gauge mediation from emergent supersymmetry proposal. In this proposal, supersymmetry is broken at Planck scale and consequently, the gravitino is superheavy and completely decouples from the low energy theory. Squarks and sleptons obtain their soft masses dominantly through gauge mediation with other mechanisms highly suppressed. The lightest supersymmetric partner, in contrast to traditional gauge mediation, is a neutralino which is also a dark matter candidate. By explicit calculation of the low energy spectra, the parameter space was constrained using the WMAP observed relic density of dark matter, LEP2 Higgs mass bounds, collider bounds on supersymmetric partners and exotic B-meson decays. We found that the model has intriguing hybrid features such as a nearly gauge-mediated spectrum (the exception being the superheavy gravitino) but with a dominant mSUGRA-like bino-stau coannihilation channel and at large tanβ, A-resonance-like annihilation.

"Let a and b be two positive integers. A culminating path is a path of Z^2 that starts from (0,0), consists of steps (1,a) and (1,-b), stays above the x-axis and ends at the highest ordinate it ever reaches. These paths were first encountered in bioinformatics, in the analysis of similarity search algorithms. They are also related to certain models of Lorentzian gravity in theoretical physics. We first show that the language on a two letter alphabet that naturally encodes culminating paths is not context-free. Then, we focus on the enumeration of culminating paths. A step by step approach, combined with the kernel method, provides a closed form expression for the generating fucntion of culminating paths ending at a (generic) height k. In the case a=b, we derive from this expression the asymptotic behaviour of the number of culminating paths of length n. When a>b, we obtain the asymptotic behaviour by a simpler argument. When a<b, we only determine the exponential growth of the number of culminating paths. Finally, we study the uniform random generation of culminating paths via various methods. The rejection approach, coupled with a symmetry argument, gives an algorithm that is linear when a>= b, with no precomputation stage nor non-linear storage required. The choice of the best algorithm is not as clear when a<b. An elementary recursive approach yields a linear algorithm after a precomputation stage involving O(n^3) arithmetic operations, but we also present some alternatives that may be more efficient in practise.

"In the theory of operads we consider functors of generalized symmetric powers defined by sums of coinvariant modules under actions of symmetric groups. One observes classically that the construction of symmetric functors provides an isomorphism from the category of symmetric modules to a subcategory of the category of functors on the base category. The purpose of this book is to obtain a similar relationship for functors on a category of algebras over an operad.We observe that right modules over operads, symmetric modules equipped with a right operad action, give rise to functors on categories of algebras and we prove that this construction yields an embedding of categories. Then we check that right modules over operads form a model category. In addition we prove that weak-equivalences of right modules correspond to pointwise weak-equivalences at the functor level. As a conclusion, we obtain that right modules over operads supply good models for the homotopy of associated functors on algebras over operads. ",0,0
"We consider an asexual population evolving on rugged fitness landscapes which are defined on the multi-dimensional genotypic space and have many local optima. We track the most populated genotype as it changes when the population jumps from a fitness peak to a better one during the process of adaptation. This is done using the dynamics of the shell model which is a simplified version of the quasispecies model for infinite populations and standard Wright-Fisher dynamics for large finite populations. We show that the population fraction of a genotype obtained within the quasispecies model and the shell model match for fit genotypes and at short times, but the dynamics of the two models are identical for questions related to the most populated genotype. We calculate exactly several properties of the jumps in infinite populations some of which were obtained numerically in previous works. We also present our preliminary simulation results for finite populations. In particular, we measure the jump distribution in time and find that it decays as t^-2 as in the quasispecies problem.

"In recent times there has been a surge of interest in seeking out patterns in the aggregate behavior of socio-economic systems. One such domain is the emergence of statistical regularities in the evolution of collective choice from individual behavior. This is manifested in the sudden emergence of popularity or 'success' of certain ideas or products, compared to their numerous, often very similar, competitors. In this paper, we present an empirical study of a wide range of popularity distributions, spanning from scientific paper citations to movie gross income. Our results show that in the majority of cases, the distribution follows a log-normal form, suggesting that multiplicative stochastic processes are the basis for emergence of popular entities. This suggests the existence of some general principles of complex organization leading to the emergence of popularity. We discuss the theoretical principles needed to explain this socio-economic phenomenon, and present a model for collective behavior that exhibits bimodality, which has been observed in certain empirical popularity distributions.

"We analyse an associative memory based on a ferrofluid, consisting of a system of magnetic nano-particles suspended in a carrier fluid of variable viscosity subject to patterns of magnetic fields from an array of input and output magnetic pads. The association relies on forming patterns in the ferrofluid during a trainingdphase, in which the magnetic dipoles are free to move and rotate to minimize the total energy of the system. Once equilibrated in energy for a given input-output magnetic field pattern-pair the particles are fully or partially immobilized by cooling the carrier liquid. Thus produced particle distributions control the memory states, which are read out magnetically using spin-valve sensors incorporated in the output pads. The actual memory consists of spin distributions that is dynamic in nature, realized only in response to the input patterns that the system has been trained for. Two training algorithms for storing multiple patterns are investigated. Using Monte Carlo simulations of the physical system we demonstrate that the device is capable of storing and recalling two sets of images, each with an accuracy approaching 100",0,0

"We study the mixing time of a systematic scan Markov chain for sampling from the uniform distribution on proper 7-colourings of a finite rectangular sub-grid of the infinite square lattice, the grid.

The systematic scan Markov chain that we present cycles through subsets consisting of 2x2 sub-grids and updates the colours assigned to the vertices using a procedure known as heat-bath. We give a computer-assisted proof that this systematic scan Markov chain mixes in O(log n) scans, where n is the size of the rectangular sub-grid.

"We present a formal model to represent and solve the unicast/multicast routing problem in networks with Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. To attain this, first we translate the network adapting it to a weighted graph (unicast) or and-or graph (multicast), where the weight on a connector corresponds to the multidimensional cost of sending a packet on the related network link: each component of the weights vector represents a different QoS metric value (e.g. bandwidth, cost, delay, packet loss). The second step consists in writing this graph as a program in Soft Constraint Logic Programming (SCLP): the engine of this framework is then able to find the best paths/trees by optimizing their costs and solving the constraints imposed on them (e.g. delay < 40msec), thus finding a solution to QoS routing problems. Moreover, c-semiring structures are a convenient tool to model QoS metrics. At last, we provide an implementation of the framework over scale-free networks and we suggest how the performance can be improved. ",0,0
"The evolution of radial gradients of metallicity in disk galaxies and its relation with the disk formation are not well understood. Theoretical models of galactic chemical evolution make contrasting predictions about the time evolution of metallicity gradients. To test chemical evolution models and trace the star formation and accretion history of low luminosity disk galaxies we focus on the Local Group galaxy M33. We analyze O/H and S/H abundances in planetary nebulae, Hii regions, and young stars, together with known [Fe/H] abundances in the old stellar population of M33. With a theoretical model, we follow the time evolution of gas (diffuse and condensed in clouds), stars, and chemical abundances in the disk of M33, assuming that the galaxy is accreting gas from an external reservoir. Our model is able to reproduce the available observational constraints on the distribution of gas and stars in M33 and to predict the time evolution of several chemical abundances. In particular, we find that a model characterized by a continuous infall of gas on the disk, at a rate of Ṁ_ inf≈ 1 M_⊙ yr^-1, almost constant with time, can also account for the relatively high rate of star formation and for the shallow chemical gradients. Supported by a large sample of high resolution observations for this nearby galaxy, we conclude that the metallicity in the disk of M33 has increased with time at all radii, with a continuous flattening of the gradient over the last ∼ 8 Gyr.

"In this paper we present a novel framework for sequence to shape maps. These combinatorial maps realize exponentially many shapes, and have preimages which contain extended connected subgraphs of diameter n (neutral networks). We prove that all basic properties of RNA folding maps also hold for combinatorial maps. Our construction is as follows: suppose we are given a graph H over the {1 >...,n} and an alphabet of nucleotides together with a symmetric relation ℛ, implied by base pairing rules. Then the shape of a sequence of length n is the maximal H subgraph in which all pairs of nucleotides incident to H-edges satisfy ℛ. Our main result is to prove the existence of at least √(2)^n-1 shapes with extended neutral networks, i.e. shapes that have a preimage with diameter n and a connected component of size at least (1+√(5)/2)^n+(1-√(5)/2)^n. Furthermore, we show that there exists a certain subset of shapes which carries a natural graph structure. In this graph any two shapes are connected by a path of shapes with respective neutral networks of distance one. We finally discuss our results and provide a comparison with RNA folding maps. ",0,0
"Molecular dynamics simulations are used to study fluidization of a vertically vibrated, three-dimensional shallow granular layer. As the container acceleration is increased above g, the granular temperature and root mean square particle displacement increase, gradually fluidizing the layer. For nearly elastic particles, or low shaking frequencies, or small layer depths, the end of the fluidization process is marked by an abrupt increase in the granular temperature and rms particle displacement. The layer is then fully fluidized since macroscopic, fluid-like phenomena such as convection rolls and surface waves are observed. Increasing the total dissipation (by either decreasing the restitution coefficient or increasing the total number of particles) decreases the increase in granular temperature and rms particle displacement at fluidization, and shifts the increase to higher accelerations. Increasing the frequency also decreases the magnitude of the jump, and shifts the change to lower accelerations. ",0,0
"Intersecting stacks of supersymmetric fractional branes on the Z_6' orientifold may be used to construct the supersymmetric Standard Model. If a,b are the stacks that generate the SU(3)_colour and SU(2)_L gauge particles, then, in order to obtain just the chiral spectrum of the (supersymmetric) Standard Model (with non-zero Yukawa couplings to the Higgs mutiplets), it is necessary that the number of intersections a ∩b of the stacks a and b, and the number of intersections a ∩b' of a with the orientifold image b' of b satisfy (a ∩b,a ∩b')=(2,1) or (1,2). It is also necessary that there is no matter in symmetric representations of the gauge group, and not too much matter in antisymmetric representations, on either stack. Fractional branes having all of these properties may be constructed on the Z_6' orientifold. We construct a (four-stack) model with two further stacks, each with just a single brane, which has precisely the matter spectrum of the supersymmetric Standard Model, including a single pair of Higgs doublets. However, the gauge group is SU(3)_colour x SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y x U(1)_H. Only the Higgs doublets are charged with respect to U(1)_H. ",0,0
"Future detection/non-detection of tensor modes from inflation in CMB observations presents a unique way to test certain features of string theory. Current limit on the ratio of tensor to scalar perturbations, r=T/S, is r < 0.3, future detection may take place for r > 10^-2-10^-3. At present all known string theory inflation models predict tensor modes well below the level of detection. Therefore a possible experimental discovery of tensor modes may present a challenge to string cosmology.The strongest bound on r in string inflation follows from the observation that in most of the models based on the KKLT construction, the value of the Hubble constant H during inflation must be smaller than the gravitino mass. For the gravitino mass in the usual range, m_3/2 < O(1) TeV, this leads to an extremely strong bound r < 10^-24. A discovery of tensor perturbations with r > 10^-3 would imply that the gravitinos in this class of models are superheavy, m_3/2 > 10^13 GeV. This would have important implications for particle phenomenology based on string theory. ",0,0
"The paper is devoted to classification problem of finite dimensional complex none Lie filiform Leibniz algebras. Actually, the observations show there are two resources to get classification of filiform Leibniz algebras. The first of them is naturally graded none Lie filiform Leibniz algebras and the another one is naturally graded filiform Lie algebras. Using the first resource we get two disjoint classes of filiform Leibniz algebras. The present paper deals with the second of the above two classes, the first class has been considered in our previous paper. The algebraic classification here means to specify the representatives of the orbits, whereas the geometric classification is the problem of finding generic structural constants in the sense of algebraic geometry. Our main effort in this paper is the algebraic classification. We suggest here an algebraic method based on invariants. Utilizing this method for any given low dimensional case all filiform Leibniz algebras can be classified. Moreover, the results can be used for geometric classification of orbits of such algebras.

"We report on follow-up observations of the GRB 060927 using the ROTSE-IIIa telescope and a suite of larger aperture ground-based telescopes. An optical afterglow was detected 20 s after the burst, the earliest rest-frame detection of optical emission from any GRB. Spectroscopy performed with the VLT about 13 hours after the trigger shows a continuum break at lambda8070 A produced by neutral hydrogen absorption at z 5.6. We also detect an absorption line at 8158 A which we interpret as SiII at z=5.467. Hence, GRB 060927 is the second most distant GRB with a spectroscopically measured redshift. The shape of the red wing of the spectral break can be fitted by a damped Lyalpha profile with a column density with log(N_HI/cm^-2)22.5. We discuss the implications of this work for the use of GRBs as probes of the end of the dark ages and draw three main conclusions: i) GRB afterglows originating from z>6 should be relatively easy to detect from the ground, but rapid NIR monitoring is necessary to ensure that they are found; ii) The presence of large HI column densities in some GRBs host galaxies at z>5 makes the use of GRBs to probe the reionization epoch via spectroscopy of the red damping wing challenging; iii) GRBs appear crucial to locate typical star-forming galaxies at z>5 and therefore the type of galaxies responsible for the reionization of the universe.

"A general theory of innovation and progress in human society is outlined, based on the combat between two opposite forces (conservatism/inertia and speculative herding 'bubble' behavior). We contend that human affairs are characterized by ubiquitous “bubbles”, which involve huge risks which would not otherwise be taken using standard cost/benefit analysis. Bubbles result from self-reinforcing positive feedbacks. This leads to explore uncharted territories and niches whose rare successes lead to extraordinary discoveries and provide the base for the observed accelerating development of technology and of the economy. But the returns are very heterogeneous, very risky and may not occur. In other words, bubbles, which are characteristic definitions of human activity, allow huge risks to get huge returns over large scales. We outline some underlying mathematical structure and a few results involving positive feedbacks, emergence, heavy-tailed power laws, outliers/kings/black swans, the problem of predictability and the illusion of control, as well as some policy implications.

"We present spectroscopic observations of a sample of 72 emission-line objects, including mainly HII regions, in the spiral galaxy M 33. Spectra were obtained with the multi-object, wide field spectrograph AF2/WYFFOS at the 4.2m WHT telescope. Line intensities, extinction, and electron density were determined for the whole sample of objects. The aim of the present work was to derive chemical and physical parameters of a set of HII regions, and from them the metallicity gradient. Electron temperatures and chemical abundances were derived for the 14 HII regions where both [OII] and [OIII] emission line fluxes were measured, including the electron temperature sensitive emission line [OIII] 436.3 nm and in a few cases [NII] 575.5 nm. The ionization correction factor (ICF) method was used to derive the total chemical abundances. The presence of abundance gradients was inferred from the radial behaviour of several emission-line ratios, and accurately measured from chemical abundances directly derived in 14 HII regions. The oxygen abundances of our HII regions, located in the radial region from2 to7.2 kpc, gave an oxygen gradient -0.054+/-0.011 dex/kpc The overall oxygen gradient for M 33 obtained using ours and previous oxygen determinations in a large number of HII regions with direct electron temperature determination as well as abundance in young stars presented a two slope shape: -0.19 dex/kpc for the central regions (R<3kpc), and -0.038dex/kpc for the outer regions (R>=3kpc).

"The purpose of this paper is to find optimal estimates for the Green function of a half-space of the relativistic α-stable process with parameter m onspace. This process has an infinitesimal generator of the form mI-(m^2/αI-Δ)^α/2, where 0<α<2, m>0, and reduces to the isotropic α-stable process for m=0. Its potential theory for open bounded sets has been well developed throughout the recent years however almost nothing was known about the behaviour of the process on unbounded sets. The present paper is intended to fill this gap and we provide two-sided sharp estimates for the Green function for a half-space. As a byproduct we obtain some improvements of the estimates known for bounded sets specially for balls. The advantage of these estimates is a clarification of the relationship between the diameter of the ball and the parameter m of the process.The main result states that the Green function is comparable with the Green function for the Brownian motion if the points are away from the boundary of a half-space and their distance is greater than one. On the other hand for the remaining points the Green function is somehow related the Green function for the isotropic α-stable process. For example, for d≥3, it is comparable with the Green function for the isotropic α-stable process, provided that the points are close enough. ",0,0

"We present absolute parallaxes and relative proper motions for five AM CVn stars, which we obtained using the Fine Guidance Sensors on board the Hubble Space Telescope. Our parallax measurements translate into distances d(AM CVn)=606+135-93 pc, d(HP Lib)=197+14-12 pc, d(CR Boo)=337+44-35 pc, d(V803 Cen)=347+32-27 pc, and d(GP Com)=75+2-2 pc. From these distances we estimate the space density of AM CVn stars and suggest that previous estimates have been too high by about an order of magnitude. We also infer the mass accretion rates which allows us to constrain the masses of the donor stars, and we show that relatively massive, semi-degenerate donor stars are favored in all systems except GP Com. Finally, we give updated estimates for their gravitational-wave signals, relevant for future space missions such as the proposed Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), based on their distances and the inferred masses of the binary components. We show that all systems but GP Com are excellent candidates for detection with LISA. ",0,0
"The observed correlation of oxygen vacancies and room temperature ferromagnetic ordering in Co doped ZnO1-o nanoparticles reported earlier (Naeem et al Nanotechnology 17, 2675-2680) has been further explored by transport and optical measurements. In these particles room temperature ferromagnetic ordering had been observed to occur only after annealing in forming gas. In the current work the optical properties have been studied by diffuse reflection spectroscopy in the UV-Vis region and the band gap of the Co doped compositions has been found to decrease with Co addition. Reflections minima are observed at the energies characteristic of Co+2 d-d (tethrahedral symmetry) crystal field transitions, further establishing the presence of Co in substitutional sites. Electrical transport measurements on palletized samples of the nanoparticles show that the effect of a forming gas is to strongly decrease the resistivity with increasing Co concentration. For the air annealed and non-ferromagnetic samples the variation in the resistivity as a function of Co content are opposite to those observed in the particles prepared in forming gas. The ferromagnetic samples exhibit an apparent change from insulator to metal with increasing temperatures for T>380K and this change becomes more pronounced with increasing Co content. The magnetic and resistive behaviors are correlated by considering the model by Calderon et al [M. J. Calderon and S. D. Sarma, Annals of Physics 2007 (Accepted doi: 10.1016/j.aop.2007.01.010] where the ferromagnetism changes from being mediated by polarons in the low temperature insulating region to being mediated by the carriers released from the weakly bound states in the higher temperature metallic region.

"We carry out cosmological chemodynamical simulations with different strengths of supernova (SN) feedback and study how galactic winds from star-forming galaxies affect the features of hydrogen (HI) and metal (CIV and OVI) absorption systems in the intergalactic medium at high redshift. We find that the outflows tend to escape to low density regions, and hardly affect the dense filaments visible in HI absorption. As a result, the strength of HI absorption near galaxies is not reduced by galactic winds, but even slightly increases. We also find that a lack of HI absorption for lines of sight (LOS) close to galaxies, as found by Adelberger et al., can be created by hot gas around the galaxies induced by accretion shock heating. In contrast to HI, metal absorption systems are sensitive to the presence of winds. The models without feedback can produce the strong CIV and OVI absorption lines in LOS within 50 kpc from galaxies, while strong SN feedback is capable of creating strong CIV and OVI lines out to about twice that distance. We also analyze the mean transmissivity of HI, CIV, and OVI within 1 h^-1 Mpc from star-forming galaxies. The probability distribution of the transmissivity of HI is independent of the strength of SN feedback, but strong feedback produces LOS with lower transmissivity of metal lines. Additionally, strong feedback can produce strong OVI lines even in cases where HI absorption is weak. We conclude that OVI is probably the best tracer for galactic winds at high redshift. ",0,0
"We construct an exactly soluble spin-1/2 model on a honeycomb lattice, which is a generalization of Kitaev model. The topological phases of the system are analyzed by study of the ground state sector of this model, the vortex-free states. Basically, there are two phases, A phase and B phase. The behaviors of both A and B phases may be studied by mapping the ground state sector into a general p-wave paired states of spinless fermions with tunable pairing parameters on a square lattice. In this p-wave paired state theory, the A phase is shown to be the strong paired phase, an insulating phase. The B phase may be either gapped or gapless determined by the generalized inversion symmetry is broken or not. The gapped B is the weak pairing phase described by either the Moore-Read Pfaffian state of the spinless fermions or anti-Pfaffian state of holes depending on the sign of the next nearest neighbor hopping amplitude. A phase transition between Pfaffian and anti-Pfaffian states are found in the gapped B phase. Furthermore, we show that there is a hidden SU(2) gauge symmetry in our model. In the gapped B phase, the ground state has a non-trivial topological number, the spectral first Chern number or the chiral central charge, which reflects the chiral anomaly of the edge state. We proved that the topological number is identified to the reduced eta-invariant and this anomaly may be cancelled by a bulk Wess-Zumino term of SO(3) group through an index theorem in 2+1 dimensions.

"(Abridged) Luminous Compact Galaxies (LCGs) (M_B < -20, R_1/2 < 4.5kpc and EW_0(OII) >15Å) constitute one of the most rapidly evolving galaxy populations over the last8 Gyr history of the universe. Due to their inherently compact sizes, any detailed quantitative analysis of their morphologies has proved to be difficult in the past. In this work we use the high angular resolution imaging data, from the HST/ACS GOODS survey, to study the quantitative morphology of a complete sample of LCGs in the redshift range 0.5 < z < 1.2. We have derived structural parameters for a representative sample of 39 LCGs selected from the GOODS-S field, using full 2-dimensional surface brightness profile fitting of the galaxy images in each of the four filters available. B-z color maps are used as an aid in the morphological classification. We then use the rest frame B band bulge flux fraction (B/T) to determine the morphological class of the galaxies. Mergers were essentially identified visually by the presence of multiple maxima of comparable intensity in the rest frame B band images, aided by the color maps to distinguish them from HII regions. We derive the following morphological mix for our sample of intermediate redshift LCGs: Mergers:36",0,0
"The problem of reconstructing and identifying intracellular protein signaling and biochemical networks is of critical importance in biology today. We sought to develop a mathematical approach to this problem using, as a test case, one of the most well-studied and clinically important signaling networks in biology today, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) driven signaling cascade. More specifically, we suggest a method, augmented sparse reconstruction, for the identification of links among nodes of ordinary differential equation (ODE) networks from a small set of trajectories with different initial conditions. Our method builds a system of representation by using a collection of integrals of all given trajectories and by attenuating block of terms in the representation itself. The system of representation is then augmented with random vectors, and minimization of the 1-norm is used to find sparse representations for the dynamical interactions of each node. Augmentation by random vectors is crucial, since sparsity alone is not able to handle the large error-in-variables in the representation. Augmented sparse reconstruction allows to consider potentially very large spaces of models and it is able to detect with high accuracy the few relevant links among nodes, even when moderate noise is added to the measured trajectories. After showing the performance of our method on a model of the EGFR protein network, we sketch briefly the potential future therapeutic applications of this approach. ",0,0
"We investigate the braneworld model with induced gravity to clarify the role of the cross-over length scale ℓin the possible explanation of the dark-matter phenomenon in astrophysics and in cosmology. Observations of the 21 cm line from neutral hydrogen clouds in spiral galaxies reveal that the rotational velocities remain nearly constant at a value v_c10^-3–10^-4 in the units of the speed of light in the region of the galactic halo. Using the smallness of v_c, we develop a perturbative scheme for reconstructing the metric in a galactic halo. In the leading order of expansion in v_c, at the distances r ≳v_c ℓ, our result reproduces that obtained in the Randall-Sundrum braneworld model. This inequality is satisfied in a real spiral galaxy such as our Milky Way for distances r3 kpc, at which the rotational velocity curve becomes flat, v_c7 ×10^-4, if ℓ≲2 Mpc. The gravitational situation in this case can be approximately described by the Einstein equations with the so-called Weyl fluid playing the role of dark matter. In the region near the gravitating body, we derive a closed system of equations for static spherically symmetric situation under the approximation of zero anisotropic stress of the Weyl fluid. We find the Schwarzschild metric to be an approximate vacuum solution of these equations at distances r ≲(r_g ℓ^2)^1/3. The value ℓ≲2 Mpc complies well with the solar-system tests. At the same time, in cosmology, a low-density braneworld with ℓof this order of magnitude can mimic the expansion properties of the high-density LCDM (lambda + cold dark matter) universe at late times. Combined observations of galactic rotation curves and gravitational lensing can possibly discriminate between the higher-dimensional effects and dark matter. ",0,0
"In the field of evaluation research, computer scientists live constantly upon dilemmas and conflicting theories. As evaluation is differently perceived and modeled among educational areas, it is not difficult to become trapped in dilemmas, which reflects an epistemological weakness. Additionally, designing and developing a computer-based learning scenario is not an easy task. Advancing further, with end-users probing the system in realistic settings, is even harder. Computer science research in evaluation faces an immense challenge, having to cope with contributions from several conflicting and controversial research fields. We believe that deep changes must be made in our field if we are to advance beyond the CBT (computer-based training) learning model and to build an adequate epistemology for this challenge. The first task is to relocate our field by building upon recent results from philosophy, psychology, social sciences, and engineering. In this article we locate evaluation in respect to communication studies. Evaluation presupposes a definition of goals to be reached, and we suggest that it is, by many means, a silent communication between teacher and student, peers, and institutional entities. If we accept that evaluation can be viewed as set of invisible rules known by nobody, but somehow understood by everybody, we should add anthropological inquiries to our research toolkit. The paper is organized around some elements of the social communication and how they convey new insights to evaluation research for computer and related scientists. We found some technical limitations and offer discussions on how we relate to technology at same time we establish expectancies and perceive others work. ",0,0
"We discuss the application of wavelet transforms to a critical interface model, which is known to provide a good description of Barkhausen noise in soft ferromagnets. The two-dimensional version of the model (one-dimensional interface) is considered, mainly in the adiabatic limit of very slow driving. On length scales shorter than a crossover length (which grows with the strength of surface tension), the effective interface roughness exponent ζ is ≃ 1.20, close to the expected value for the universality class of the quenched Edwards-Wilkinson model. We find that the waiting times between avalanches are fully uncorrelated, as the wavelet transform of their autocorrelations scales as white noise. Similarly, detrended size-size correlations give a white-noise wavelet transform. Consideration of finite driving rates, still deep within the intermittent regime, shows the wavelet transform of correlations scaling as 1/f^1.5 for intermediate frequencies. This behavior is ascribed to intra-avalanche correlations. ",0,0

"[ABRIDGED] We report the results of a 944-epoch survey for transient sources with archival data from the Very Large Array spanning 22 years with a typical epoch separation of 7 days. Observations were obtained at 5 or 8.4 GHz for a single field of view with a full-width at half-maximum of 8.6' and 5.1', respectively, and achieved a typical point-source detection threshold at the beam center of300 microJy per epoch. Ten transient sources were detected with a significance threshold such that only one false positive would be expected. Of these transients, eight were detected in only a single epoch. Two transients were too faint to be detected in individual epochs but were detected in two-month averages. None of the ten transients was detected in longer-term averages or associated with persistent emission in the deep image produced from the combination of all epochs. The cumulative rate for the short timescale radio transients above 370 microJy at 5 and 8.4 GHz is 0.07 < R < 40 deg^-2 yr^-1, where the uncertainty is due to the unknown duration of the transients, 20 min < t_char < 7 days.

"The properties of certain networks are determined by hidden variables that are not explicitly measured. The conditional probability (propagator) that a vertex with a given value of the hidden variable is connected to k of other vertices determines all measurable properties. We study hidden variable models and find an averaging approximation that enables us to obtain a general analytical result for the propagator. Analytic results showing the validity of the approximation are obtained. We apply hidden variable models to protein-protein interaction networks (PINs) in which the hidden variable is the association free-energy, determined by distributions that depend on biochemistry and evolution. We compute degree distributions as well as clustering coefficients of several PINs of different species; good agreement with measured data is obtained. For the human interactome two different parameter sets give the same degree distributions, but the computed clustering coefficients differ by a factor of about two. This shows that degree distributions are not sufficient to determine the properties of PINs. ",0,0

"We perform a series of two-dimensional magnetorotational core-collapse simulations of Pop III stars. Changing the initial distributions of rotation and magnetic fields prior to collapse in a parametric manner, we compute 19 models. By so doing, we systematically investigate how rotation and magnetic fields affect the collapse dynamics and explore how the properties of the black-hole formations and neutrino emissions could be affected. As for the microphysics, we employ a realistic equation of state and approximate the neutrino transfer by a multiflavour leakage scheme. With these computations, we find that the jet-like explosions are obtained by the magnetodriven shock waves if the initial magnetic field is as large as 10^12 G. We point out that the black-hole masses at the formation decrease with the initial field strength, on the other hand, increase with the initial rotation rates. As for the neutrino properties, we point out that the degree of the differential rotation plays an important role to determine which species of the neutrino luminosity is more dominant than the others. Furthermore, we find that the stronger magnetic fields make the peak neutrino luminosities smaller, because the magnetic pressure acts to halt the collapse in the central regions, leading to the suppression of the releasable gravitational binding energies.

"Higher-Order Fixpoint Logic (HFL) is a hybrid of the simply typed λ-calculus and the modal λ-calculus. This makes it a highly expressive temporal logic that is capable of expressing various interesting correctness properties of programs that are not expressible in the modal λ-calculus.This paper provides complexity results for its model checking problem. In particular we consider those fragments of HFL built by using only types of bounded order k and arity m. We establish k-fold exponential time completeness for model checking each such fragment. For the upper bound we use fixpoint elimination to obtain reachability games that are singly-exponential in the size of the formula and k-fold exponential in the size of the underlying transition system. These games can be solved in deterministic linear time. As a simple consequence, we obtain an exponential time upper bound on the expression complexity of each such fragment.The lower bound is established by a reduction from the word problem for alternating (k-1)-fold exponential space bounded Turing Machines. Since there are fixed machines of that type whose word problems are already hard with respect to k-fold exponential time, we obtain, as a corollary, k-fold exponential time completeness for the data complexity of our fragments of HFL, provided m exceeds 3. This also yields a hierarchy result in expressive power. ",0,0

Moreover, the dynamics exhibits aging at these time scales with time-time correlation function converging to the arcsine law of this α-stable subordinator. In other words, up to rescaling, on these time scales (that are shorter than the equilibration time of the system), the dynamics of p-spin models ages in the same way as the REM, and by extension Bouchaud's REM-like trap model, confirming the latter as a universal aging mechanism for a wide range of systems.

The centroid of the emission is co-located with the position of TeV J2032+4130.The energy spectrum of the emission coinciding with the position and extension of TeV J2032+4130 can be modeled by a power-law model with a photon index Γ=1.5±0.2_stat±0.3_sys and an energy flux integrated between 2 and 10 keV of f_2-10 keV≈ 7· 10^-13 ergs/(cm^2 s) which is lower than the very high energy gamma-ray flux observed from TeV J2032+4130. We conclude that the faint extended X-ray emission discovered in this observation is the X-ray counterpart of TeV J2032+4130. Formally, it can not be excluded that the extended emission is due to an unrelated population of faint, hot (k_BT≈ 10 keV) unresolved point-sources which by chance coincides with the position and extension of TeV J2032+4130. We discuss our findings in the frame of both hadronic and leptonic gamma-ray production scenarios. ",0,0
"Extending network lifetime of battery-operated devices is a key design issue that allows uninterrupted information exchange among distributive nodes in wireless sensor networks. Collaborative beamforming (CB) and cooperative transmission (CT) have recently emerged as new communication techniques that enable and leverage effective resource sharing among collaborative/cooperative nodes. In this paper, we seek to maximize the lifetime of sensor networks by using the new idea that closely located nodes can use CB/CT to reduce the load or even avoid packet forwarding requests to nodes that have critical battery life. First, we study the effectiveness of CB/CT to improve the signal strength at a faraway destination using energy in nearby nodes. Then, a 2D disk case is analyzed to assess the resulting performance improvement. For general networks, if information-generation rates are fixed, the new routing problem is formulated as a linear programming problem; otherwise, the cost for routing is dynamically adjusted according to the amount of energy remaining and the effectiveness of CB/CT. From the analysis and simulation results, it is seen that the proposed schemes can improve the lifetime by about 90",0,0
"Despite their claimed biological plausibility, most self organizing networks have strict topological constraints and consequently they cannot take into account a wide range of external stimuli. Furthermore their evolution is conditioned by deterministic laws which often are not correlated with the structural parameters and the global status of the network, as it should happen in a real biological system. In nature the environmental inputs are noise affected and fuzzy. Which thing sets the problem to investigate the possibility of emergent behaviour in a not strictly constrained net and subjected to different inputs. It is here presented a new model of Evolutionary Neural Gas (ENG) with any topological constraints, trained by probabilistic laws depending on the local distortion errors and the network dimension. The network is considered as a population of nodes that coexist in an ecosystem sharing local and global resources. Those particular features allow the network to quickly adapt to the environment, according to its dimensions. The ENG model analysis shows that the net evolves as a scale-free graph, and justifies in a deeply physical sense- the term gas here used. ",0,0
"The branching ratios and CP violations of the B→ Dπ decays, including both the color-allowed and the color-suppressed modes, are investigated in detail within QCD framework by considering all diagrams which lead to three effective currents of two quarks. An intrinsic mass scale as a dynamical gluon mass is introduced to treat the infrared divergence caused by the soft collinear approximation in the endpoint regions, and the Cutkosky rule is adopted to deal with a physical-region singularity of the on mass-shell quark propagators. When the dynamical gluon mass μ_g is regarded as a universal scale, it is extracted to be around μ_g = 440 MeV from one of the well-measured B→ Dπ decay modes. The resulting predictions for all branching ratios are in agreement with the current experimental measurements. As these decays have no penguin contributions, there are no direct CP asymmetries. Due to interference between the Cabibbo-suppressed and the Cabibbo-favored amplitudes, mixing-induced CP violations are predicted in the B→ D^±π^∓ decays to be consistent with the experimental data at 1-σ level. More precise measurements will be helpful to extract weak angle 2β+γ. ",0,0
"One of the major problems in computational biology is the inability of existing classification models to incorporate expanding and new domain knowledge. This problem of static classification models is addressed in this paper by the introduction of incremental learning for problems in bioinformatics. Many machine learning tools have been applied to this problem using static machine learning structures such as neural networks or support vector machines that are unable to accommodate new information into their existing models. We utilize the fuzzy ARTMAP as an alternate machine learning system that has the ability of incrementally learning new data as it becomes available. The fuzzy ARTMAP is found to be comparable to many of the widespread machine learning systems. The use of an evolutionary strategy in the selection and combination of individual classifiers into an ensemble system, coupled with the incremental learning ability of the fuzzy ARTMAP is proven to be suitable as a pattern classifier. The algorithm presented is tested using data from the G-Coupled Protein Receptors Database and shows good accuracy of 83",0,0
"The multi-frequency Sedentary Survey is a flux limited, statistically well-defined sample of highly X-ray dominated BL Lacertae objects (HBLs) which includes 150 sources. In this paper, the third of the series, we report the results of a dedicated optical spectroscopy campaign that, together with results from other independent optical follow up programs, led to the spectroscopic identification of all sources in the sample. We carried out a systematic spectroscopic campaign for the observation of all unidentified objects of the sample using the ESO 3.6m, the KPNO 4m, and the TNG optical telescopes. We present new identifications and optical spectra for 76 sources, 50 of which are new BL Lac objects, 18 are sources previously referred as BL Lacs but for which no redshift information was available, and 8 are broad emission lines AGNs. We find that the multi-frequency selection technique used to build the survey is highly efficient (about 90",0,0
"As part of an effort to enlarge the number of well-studied Magellanic-type galaxies, we obtained broadband optical imaging and neutral hydrogen radio synthesis observations of the dwarf irregular galaxy ESO 364-G 029. The optical morphology characteristically shows a bar-like main body with a one-sided spiral arm, an approximately exponential light distribution, and offset photometric and kinematic centers. The HI distribution is mildly asymmetric and, although slightly offset from the photometric center, roughly follows the optical brightness distribution, extending to over 1.2 Holmberg radii (where mu_B = 26.5 mag/arcsec^2). In particular, the highest HI column densities closely follow the bar, one-arm spiral, and a third optical extension. The rotation is solid-body in the inner parts but flattens outside of the optical extent. The total HI flux F_HI = 23.1 pm 1.2 Jy km/s, yielding a total HI mass M_HI= (6.4 pm 1.7) x 10^8 Msun (for a distance D = 10.8 pm 1.4 Mpc) and a total HI mass-to-blue-luminosity ratio M_HI/L_B = (0.96 pm 0.14) Msun / Lsun,B (distance independent). The HI data suggest a very complex small-scale HI structure, with evidence of large shells and/or holes, but deeper observations are required for a detailed study. Follow-up observations are also desirable for a proper comparison with the Large Magellanic Cloud, where despite an optical morphology very similar to ESO 364-G 029 the HI bears little resemblance to the optical.

"A large sample of pulsars has been observed to study their subpulse modulation at an observing wavelength (when achievable) of both 21 and 92 cm using the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope. In this paper we present the 92-cm data and a comparison is made with the already published 21-cm results. We analysed 191 pulsars at 92 cm using fluctuation spectra. The sample of pulsars is as unbiased as possible towards any particular pulsar characteristics. For 15 pulsars drifting subpulses are discovered for the first time and 26 of the new drifters found in the 21-cm data are confirmed. We discovered nulling for 8 sources and 8 pulsars are found to intermittently emit single pulses that have pulse energies similar to giant pulses. It is estimated that at least half of the total population of pulsars have drifting subpulses when observations with a high enough signal-to-noise ratio would be available. It could well be that the drifting subpulse mechanism is an intrinsic property of the emission mechanism itself, although for some pulsars it is difficult or impossible to detect. Drifting subpulses are in general found at both frequencies, although the chance of detecting drifting subpulses is possibly slightly higher at 92 cm. It appears that the youngest pulsars have the most disordered subpulses and the subpulses become more and more organized into drifting subpulses as the pulsar ages. The correlations with the modulation indices are argued to be consistent with the picture in which the radio emission can be divided in a drifting subpulse signal plus a quasi-steady signal which becomes, on average, stronger at high observing frequencies. The measured values of P3 at the two frequencies are highly correlated, but there is no evidence for a correlation with other pulsar parameters. ",0,0
"The possibility to recover the which-way information, for example in the two slit experiment, is based on a natural but implicit assumption about the position of a particle before a position measurement is performed on it. This assumption cannot be deduced from the standard postulates of quantum mechanics. In the present paper this assumption is made explicit and formally postulated as a new rule, the quantum typicality rule. This rule correlates the positions of the particles at two different times, thus defining their trajectories. Unexpectedly, this rule is also equivalent to the Born rule with regard to the explanation of the results of statistical experiments. For this reason it can be considered a generalization of the Born rule. The existence of the quantum typicality rule strongly suggests the possibility of a new trajectory-based formulation of quantum mechanics. According to this new formulation, a closed quantum system is represented as a quantum process, which corresponds to a canonical stochastic process in which the probability measure is replaced by the wave function and the usual frequentist interpretation of probability is replaced by the quantum typicality rule.

"We present semi-analytical constraint on the amount of dark matter in the merging bullet galaxy cluster using the classical Local Group timing arguments. We consider particle orbits in potential models which fit the lensing data. Marginally consistent CDM models in Newtonian gravity are found with a total mass M_CDM = 1 x 10^15Msun of Cold DM: the bullet subhalo can move with V_DM=3000km/s, and the 'bullet' X-ray gas can move with V_gas=4200km/s. These are nearly the maximum speeds that are accelerable by the gravity of two truncated CDM halos in a Hubble time even without the ram pressure. Consistency breaks down if one adopts higher end of the error bars for the bullet gas speed (5000-5400km/s), and the bullet gas would not be bound by the sub-cluster halo for the Hubble time. Models with V_DM4500km/sV_gas would invoke unrealistic large amount M_CDM=7x 10^15Msun of CDM for a cluster containing only10^14Msun of gas. Our results are generalisable beyond General Relativity, e.g., a speed of 4500 is easily obtained in the relativistic MONDian lensing model of Angus et al. (2007). However, MONDian model with little hot dark matter M_HDM≤ 0.6× 10^15 and CDM model with a small halo mass ≤ 1× 10^15 are barely consistent with lensing and velocity data. ",0,0
"We present predictions for the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function, number counts and redshift distributions in the IR based on the Lambda-CDM cosmological model. We use the combined GALFORM semi-analytical galaxy formation model and GRASIL spectrophotometric code to compute galaxy SEDs including the reprocessing of radiation by dust. The model, which is the same as that in Baugh et al (2005), assumes two different IMFs: a normal solar neighbourhood IMF for quiescent star formation in disks, and a very top-heavy IMF in starbursts triggered by galaxy mergers. We have shown previously that the top-heavy IMF seems to be necessary to explain the number counts of faint sub-mm galaxies. We compare the model with observational data from the SPITZER Space Telescope, with the model parameters fixed at values chosen before SPITZER data became available. We find that the model matches the observed evolution in the IR remarkably well over the whole range of wavelengths probed by SPITZER. In particular, the SPITZER data show that there is strong evolution in the mid-IR galaxy luminosity function over the redshift range z0-2, and this is reproduced by our model without requiring any adjustment of parameters. On the other hand, a model with a normal IMF in starbursts predicts far too little evolution in the mid-IR luminosity function, and is therefore excluded. ",0,0
"The MiniBooNE and LSND experiments are compatible with each other when two sterile neutrinos are added to the three active ones. In this case there are eight possible mass orderings. In two of them both sterile neutrinos are heavier than the three active ones. In the next two scenarios both sterile neutrinos are lighter than the three active ones. The remaining four scenarios have one sterile neutrino heavier and another lighter than the three active ones. We analyze all scenarios with respect to their predictions for mass-related observables. These are the sum of neutrino masses as constrained by cosmological observations, the kinematic mass parameter as measurable in the KATRIN experiment, and the effective mass governing neutrinoless double beta decay. It is investigated how these non-oscillation probes can distinguish between the eight scenarios. Six of the eight possible mass orderings predict positive signals in the KATRIN and future neutrinoless double beta decay experiments. We also remark on scenarios with three sterile neutrinos. In addition we make some comments on the possibility of using decays of high energy astrophysical neutrinos to discriminate between the mass orderings in presence of two sterile neutrinos. ",0,0
"We extend the definition of the Costas property to functions in the continuum, namely on intervals of the reals or the rationals, and argue that such functions can be used in the same applications as discrete Costas arrays. We construct Costas bijections in the real continuum within the class of piecewise continuously differentiable functions, but our attempts to construct a fractal-like Costas bijection there are successful only under slight but necessary deviations from the usual arithmetic laws. Furthermore, we are able, contingent on the validity of Artin's conjecture, to set up a limiting process according to which sequences of Welch Costas arrays converge to smooth Costas bijections over the reals. The situation over the rationals is different: there, we propose an algorithm of great generality and flexibility for the construction of a Costas fractal bijection. Its success, though, relies heavily on the enumerability of the rationals, and therefore it cannot be generalized over the reals in an obvious way. ",0,0
"The 105-ms X-ray pulsar J1852+0040 is the central compact object (CCO) in SNR Kes 79. We report a sensitive upper limit on its radio flux density of 12 uJy at 2 GHz using the NRAO GBT. Timing using XMM and Chandra over a 2.4 yr span reveals no significant change in its spin period. The 2 sigma upper limit on the period derivative leads, in the dipole spin-down formalism, to an energy loss rate E-dot < 7e33 ergs/s, surface magnetic field strength B_p < 1.5e11 G, and characteristic age tau_c = P/2P-dot > 8 Myr. This tau_c exceeds the age of the SNR by 3 orders of magnitude, implying that the pulsar was born spinning at its current period.

"We report the detection of CO(3-2) emission from a bright, gravitationally lensed Lyman Break Galaxy, LBGJ213512.73-010143 (the 'Cosmic Eye'), at z=3.07 using the Plateau de Bure Interferometer. This is only the second detection of molecular gas emission from an LBG and yields an intrinsic molecular gas mass of (2.4+/-0.4)x10^9 Mo. The lens reconstruction of the UV morphology of the LBG indicates that it comprises two components separated by2 kpc. The CO emission is unresolved, and appears to be centered on the intrinsically fainter (and also less highly magnified) of the two UV components. The width of the CO line indicates a dynamical mass of (8+/-2)x10^9csc(i)^2 Mo within the central 2 kpc. Employing mid-infrared observations from Spitzer we derive a stellar mass of(6+/-2)x10^9 Mo and a star-formation rate of60 Mo/yr, indicating that the molecular gas will be consumed in40 Myr. The gas fractions, star-formation efficiencies and line widths suggests that LBGJ213512 is a high-redshift, gas-rich analog of a local luminous infrared galaxy. This galaxy has a similar gas-to-dynamical mass fraction as observed in the submillimeter-selected population, although the gas surface density and star-formation efficiency is a factor of 3x less, suggesting less vigorous activity. We discuss the uncertainties in our conclusions arising from adopting a CO-to-H2 conversion factor appropriate for either the Milky Way or local luminous infrared galaxies. These observations demonstrate that current facilities, when aided by fortuitous gravitational magnification, can study 'ordinary' galaxies at high-redshift and so act as pathfinders for ALMA. ",0,0
Alternating layers of granular Iron (Fe) and Titanium dioxide (TiO_2-δ) were deposited on (100) Lanthanum aluminate (LaAlO_3) substrates in low oxygen chamber pressure using a controlled pulsed laser ablation deposition technique. The total thickness of the film was about 200 nm. The films show ferromagnetic behavior for temperatures ranging from 4 to 400 ^oK. The layered film structure was characterized as p-type magnetic semiconductor at 300 ^oK with a carrier density of the order of 10^20 /cm^3. The undoped pure TiO_2-δ film was characterized as an n-type magnetic semiconductor. The hole carriers were excited at the interface between the granular Fe and TiO_2-δ layers similar to holes excited in the metal/n-type semiconductor interface commonly observed in Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) devices. The holes at the interface were polarized in an applied magnetic field raising the possibility that these granular MOS structures can be utilized for practical spintronic device applications. ,0,0
"We consider the evolution of strong (W_r(2796) > 0.3A) MgII absorbers, most of which are closely related to luminous galaxies. Using 20 high resolution quasar spectra from the VLT/UVES public archive, we examine 33 strong MgII absorbers in the redshift range 0.3 < z < 2.5. We compare and supplement this sample with 23 strong MgII absorbers at 0.4 < z < 1.4 observed previously with HIRES/Keck. We find that neither equivalent width nor kinematic spread (the optical depth weighted second moment of velocity) of MgII2796 evolve. However, the kinematic spread is sensitive to the highest velocity component, and therefore not as sensitive to additional weak components at intermediate velocities relative to the profile center. The fraction of absorbing pixels within the full velocity range of the system does show a trend of decreasing with decreasing redshift. Most high redshift systems (14/20) exhibit absorption over the entire system velocity range, which differs from the result for low redshift systems (18/36) at the 95",0,0
"The generator coordinate (GC) method is a variational approach to the quantum many-body problem in which interacting many-body wave functions are constructed as superpositions of (generally nonorthogonal) eigenstates of auxiliary Hamiltonians containing a deformation parameter. This paper presents a time-dependent extension of the GC method as a new approach to improve existing approximations of the exchange-correlation (XC) potential in time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT). The time-dependent GC method is shown to be a conceptually and computationally simple tool to build memory effects into any existing adiabatic XC potential. As an illustration, the method is applied to driven parametric oscillations of two interacting electrons in a harmonic potential (Hooke's atom). It is demonstrated that a proper choice of time-dependent generator coordinates in conjunction with the adiabatic local-density approximation reproduces the exact linear and nonlinear two-electron dynamics quite accurately, including features associated with double excitations that cannot be captured by TDDFT in the adiabatic approximation.

"Given a triangulation of a closed, oriented, irreducible, atoroidal 3-manifold every oriented, incompressible surface may be isotoped into normal position relative to the triangulation. Such a normal oriented surface is then encoded by non-negative integer weights, 14 for each 3-simplex, that describe how many copies of each oriented normal disc type there are. The Euler characteristic and homology class are both linear functions of the weights. There is a convex polytope in the space of weights, defined by linear equations given by the combinatorics of the triangulation, whose image under the homology map is the unit ball, B, of the Thurston norm.Applications of this approach include (1) an algorithm to compute B and hence the Thurston norm of any homology class, (2) an explicit exponential bound on the number of vertices of B in terms of the number of simplices in the triangulation, (3) an algorithm to determine the fibred faces of B and hence an algorithm to decide whether a 3-manifold fibres over the circle.

"The magnetic structure of the intermetallic antiferromagnet Sm2IrIn8 was determined using x-ray resonant magnetic scattering (XRMS). Below TN = 14.2, Sm2IrIn8 has a commensurate antiferromagnetic structure with a propagation vector (1/2,0,0). The Sm magnetic moments lie in the ab plane and are rotated roughly 18 degrees away from the a axis.

"We reanalyse leptogenesis via the out-of-equilibrium decay of the lightest right-handed neutrino in type II seesaw scenarios, taking into account flavour-dependent effects. In the type II seesaw mechanism, in addition to the type I seesaw contribution, an additional direct mass term for the light neutrinos is present. We consider type II seesaw scenarios where this additional contribution arises from the vacuum expectation value of a Higgs triplet, and furthermore an effective model-independent approach. We investigate bounds on the flavour-specific decay asymmetries, on the mass of the lightest right-handed neutrino and on the reheat temperature of the early universe, and compare them to the corresponding bounds in the type I seesaw framework. We show that while flavour-dependent thermal type II leptogenesis becomes more efficient for larger mass scale of the light neutrinos, and the bounds become relaxed, the type I seesaw scenario for leptogenesis becomes more constrained. We also argue that in general, flavour-dependent effects cannot be ignored when dealing with leptogenesis in type II seesaw models. ",0,0
"We reconstruct a rational Lax matrix of size R+1 from its spectral curve (the desingularization of the characteristic polynomial) and some additional data. Using a twisted Cauchy–like kernel (a bi-differential of bi-weight (1-nu,nu)) we provide a residue-formula for the entries of the Lax matrix in terms of bases of dual differentials of weights nu and 1-nu respectively. All objects are described in the most explicit terms using Theta functions. Via a sequence of “elementary twists”, we construct sequences of Lax matrices sharing the same spectral curve and polar structure and related by conjugations by rational matrices. Particular choices of elementary twists lead to construction of sequences of Lax matrices related to finite–band recurrence relations (i.e. difference operators) sharing the same shape. Recurrences of this kind are satisfied by several types of orthogonal and biorthogonal polynomials. The relevance of formulae obtained to the study of the large degree asymptotics for these polynomials is indicated. ",0,0

This spectral line is seen here in absorption against the cosmic microwave background, indicating the presence of widespread warm molecular gas at intermediate densities. Overall, the distributions of H_2CO and CO (taken from the literature) are fairly similar, though significant differences exist at small scales. Most notably, while the CO peak is nearly coincident with the S140 Hα arc, the maximum H_2CO absorption is clearly separated from it by a full 10' beam (∼ 3 pc). We argue that these differences result from differing abundances and excitation requirements. The CO(1-0) line is more optically thick and more biased towards warm gas than the H_2CO 6 cm line. On the other hand, formaldehyde is more easily photodissociated and is, therefore, a poorer tracer of the molecular gas located immediately behind Photon Dominated Regions. ",0,0
"The Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) is one of a new generation of detectors of gravitational radiation. The existence of gravitational radiation was first predicted by Einstein in 1916, however gravitational waves have not yet been directly observed. One source of gravitation radiation is binary inspiral. Two compact bodies orbiting each other, such as a pair of black holes, lose energy to gravitational radiation. As the system loses energy the bodies spiral towards each other. This causes their orbital speed and the amount of gravitational radiation to increase, producing a characteristic “chirp” waveform in the LIGO sensitive band. In this thesis, matched filtering of LIGO science data is used to search for low mass binary systems in the halo of dark matter surrounding the Milky Way. Observations of gravitational microlensing events of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud suggest that some fraction of the dark matter in the halo may be in the form of Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). It has been proposed that low mass black holes formed in the early universe may be a component of the MACHO population; some fraction of these black hole MACHOs will be in binary systems and detectable by LIGO. The inspiral from a MACHO binary composed of two 0.5 solar mass black holes enters the LIGO sensitive band around 40 Hz. The chirp signal increases in amplitude and frequency, sweeping through the sensitive band to 4400 Hz in 140 seconds. By using evidence from microlensing events and theoretical predictions of the population an upper limit is placed on the rate of black hole MACHO inspirals in the galactic halo. ",0,0
"We compute the Coleman Weinberg effective potential for the Higgs field in RS Gauge-Higgs unification scenarios based on a bulk SO(5) x U(1)_X gauge symmetry, with gauge and fermion fields propagating in the bulk and a custodial symmetry protecting the generation of large corrections to the T parameter and the coupling of the Z to the bottom quark. We demonstrate that electroweak symmetry breaking may be realized, with proper generation of the top and bottom quark masses for the same region of bulk mass parameters that lead to good agreement with precision electroweak data in the presence of a light Higgs. We compute the Higgs mass and demonstrate that for the range of parameters for which the Higgs boson has Standard Model-like properties, the Higgs mass is naturally in a range that varies between values close to the LEP experimental limit and about 160 GeV. This mass range may be probed at the Tevatron and at the LHC. We analyze the KK spectrum and briefly discuss the phenomenology of the light resonances arising in our model. ",0,0
"Using post-Newtonian equations of motion for fluid bodies valid to the second post-Newtonian order, we derive the equations of motion for binary systems with finite-sized, non-spinning but arbitrarily shaped bodies. In particular we study the contributions of the internal structure of the bodies (such as self-gravity) that would diverge if the size of the bodies were to shrink to zero. Using a set of virial relations accurate to the first post-Newtonian order that reflect the stationarity of each body, and redefining the masses to include 1PN and 2PN self-gravity terms, we demonstrate the complete cancellation of a class of potentially divergent, structure-dependent terms that scale as s^-1 and s^-5/2, where s is the characteristic size of the bodies. This is further evidence of the Strong Equivalence Principle, and supports the use of post-Newtonian approximations to derive equations of motion for strong-field bodies such as neutron stars and black holes. This extends earlier work done by Kopeikin. ",0,0

"We study planar clusters consisting of loops including a Josephson π-junction (π-rings). Each π-ring carries a persistent current and behaves as a classical orbital moment. The type of particular state associated with the orientation of orbital moments at the cluster depends on the interaction between these orbital moments and can be easily controlled, i.e. by a bias current or by other means. We show that these systems can be described by the two-dimensional Ising model with competing nearest-neighbor and diagonal interactions and investigate the phase diagram of this model. The characteristic features of the model are analyzed based on the exact solutions for small clusters such as a 5-site square plaquette as well as on a mean-field type approach for the infinite square lattice of Ising spins. The results are compared with spin patterns obtained by Monte Carlo simulations for the 100 × 100 square lattice and with experiment. We show that the π-ring clusters may be used as a new type of superconducting memory elements. The obtained results may be verified in experiments and are applicable to adiabatic quantum computing where the states are switched adiabatically with the slow change of coupling constants. ",0,0
"I discuss fundamental limits placed on information and information processing by gravity. Such limits arise because both information and its processing require energy, while gravitational collapse (formation of a horizon or black hole) restricts the amount of energy allowed in a finite region. Specifically, I use a criterion for gravitational collapse called the hoop conjecture. Once the hoop conjecture is assumed a number of results can be obtained directly: the existence of a fundamental uncertainty in spatial distance of order the Planck length, bounds on information (entropy) in a finite region, and a bound on the rate of information processing in a finite region. In the final section I discuss some cosmological issues related to the total amount of information in the universe, and note that almost all detailed aspects of the late universe are determined by the randomness of quantum outcomes. This paper is based on a talk presented at a 2007 Bellairs Research Institute (McGill University) workshop on black holes and quantum information. ",0,0
"A new kinematic and dynamic study of the halo of the giant elliptical galaxy, NGC 5128, is presented. From a spectroscopically confirmed sample of 340 globular clusters and 780 planetary nebulae, the rotation amplitude, rotation axis, velocity dispersion, and the total dynamical mass are determined for the halo of NGC 5128. The globular cluster kinematics were searched for both radial dependence and metallicity dependence by subdividing the globular cluster sample into 158 metal-rich ([Fe/H] > -1.0) and 178 metal-poor ([Fe/H] < -1.0) globular clusters. Our results show the kinematics of the metal-rich and metal-poor subpopulations are quite similar. The kinematics are compared to the planetary nebula population where differences are apparent in the outer regions of the halo. The total mass of NGC 5128 is found using the Tracer Mass estimator (Evans et al. 2003), to determine the mass supported by internal random motions, and the spherical component of the Jeans equation to determine the mass supported by rotation. We find a total mass of (1.0+/-0.2) x 10^(12) Msun from the planetary nebulae data out to a projected radius of 90 kpc and (1.3+/-0.5) x 10^(12) Msun from the globular clusters out to a projected radius of 50 kpc. Lastly, we present a new and homogeneous catalog of known globular clusters in NGC 5128. This catalog combines all previous definitive cluster identifications from radial velocity studies and HST imaging studies, as well as 80 new globular clusters from a study of M.A. Beasley et al.

"We present the first detailed study of the properties (temperatures, gravities, and masses) of the NGC 6791 white dwarf population. This unique stellar system is both one of the oldest (8 Gyr) and most metal-rich ([Fe/H]0.4) open clusters in our Galaxy, and has a color-magnitude diagram (CMD) that exhibits both a red giant clump and a much hotter extreme horizontal branch. Fitting the Balmer lines of the white dwarfs in the cluster, using Keck/LRIS spectra, suggests that most of these stars are undermassive, <M> = 0.43 +/- 0.06 Msun, and therefore could not have formed from canonical stellar evolution involving the helium flash at the tip of the red giant branch. We show that at least 40",0,0
"We discuss the difficulties of predicting the solar cycle using mean-field models. Here we argue that these difficulties arise owing to the significant modulation of the solar activity cycle, and that this modulation arises owing to either stochastic or deterministic processes. We analyse the implications for predictability in both of these situations by considering two separate solar dynamo models. The first model represents a stochastically-perturbed flux transport dynamo. Here even very weak stochastic perturbations can give rise to significant modulation in the activity cycle. This modulation leads to a loss of predictability. In the second model, we neglect stochastic effects and assume that generation of magnetic field in the Sun can be described by a fully deterministic nonlinear mean-field model – this is a best case scenario for prediction. We designate the output from this deterministic model (with parameters chosen to produce chaotically modulated cycles) as a target timeseries that subsequent deterministic mean-field models are required to predict. Long-term prediction is impossible even if a model that is correct in all details is utilised in the prediction. Furthermore, we show that even short-term prediction is impossible if there is a small discrepancy in the input parameters from the fiducial model. This is the case even if the predicting model has been tuned to reproduce the output of previous cycles. Given the inherent uncertainties in determining the transport coefficients and nonlinear responses for mean-field models, we argue that this makes predicting the solar cycle using the output from such models impossible.

"We propose that the smallness of the light quark masses is related to the smallness of the T violation in hadronic weak interactions. Accordingly, for each of the two quark sectors ('upper' and 'lower') we construct a 3×3 mass matrix in a bases of unobserved quark states, such that the 'upper'and 'lower' basis states correspond exactly via the W^± transitions in the weak interaction. In the zeroth approximation of our formulation, we assume T conservation by making all matrix elements real. In addition, we impose a 'hidden symmetry' (invariance under simultaneous translations of all three basis quark states in each sector), which ensures a zero mass eigenstate in each sector.Next, we simultaneously break the hidden symmetry and T invariance by introducing a phase factor e^iχ in the interaction for each sector. The Jarlskog invariant J_CKM, as well as the light quark masses are evaluated in terms of the parameters of the model. We find a simple relation with J_CKM=(m_dm_s/m_b^2)^1/2Aλ^3cos(χ/2), with A and λthe Wolfenstein parameters. Setting J_CKM=3.08 ×10^-5, m_b=4.7GeV, m_s=95MeV, A=0.818 and λ=0.227, we find m_dcos^2(χ/2) ≃2.4MeV, consistent with the accepted value m_d=3-7MeV.We make a parallel proposal for the lepton sectors. With the hidden symmetry and in the approximation of T invariance, both the masses of e and ν_1 are zero. The neutrino mapping matrix V_νis shown to be of the same Harrison-Scott form which is in agreement with experiments. We also examine the correction due to T violation, and evaluate the corresponding Jarlskog invariant J_ν. ",0,0
"In this note, we consider possible constraints from t t̅ production on the gauge bosons of theories with an extended strong interaction sector such as axigluons or flavour universal colorons. Such constraints are found to be competitive with those obtained from the dijet data. The current t t̅ data from the Tevatron rule out axigluon masses (m_A) up to 900 GeV and 850 GeV at 2 σ and 4 σ levels respectively. For the case of flavour universal colorons the data rule out a mass (m_C) below 800 GeV (780 GeV) at the 2 (4) σ level and also the mass range between 900 GeV to 2.1 TeV at 2 σ level, for ξ = 1, where ξ is the mixing angle. For ξ =2 on the other hand, the excluded range is m_C950 (920) GeV and m_C1.02 (1.15m_C1.8) TeV at 2 σ (4 σ) level. We point out that for higher axigluon/coloron masses, even for the dijet channel, the limits on the coloron mass, for ξ = 1, may be different than those for the axigluon. We also compute the expected forward-backward asymmetry for the case of the axigluons which would allow it to be discriminated against the SM as also the colorons. We further find that at the LHC, the signal should be visible in the t t̅ invariant mass spectrum for a wide range of axigluon and coloron masses that are still allowed. We point out how top polarisation may be used to further discriminate the axigluon and coloron case from the SM as well as from each other. ",0,0
"Robinson-Wilczek's recent work shows that, the energy momentum tensor flux required to cancel gravitational anomaly at the event horizon of a Schwarzschild-type black hole has an equivalent form to that of a (1+1)-dimensional blackbody radiation at the Hawking temperature. Motivated by their work, Hawking radiation from the cosmological horizons of the general Schwarzschild-de Sitter and Kerr-de Sitter black holes, has been studied by the method of anomaly cancellation. The result shows that the absorbing gauge current and energy momentum tensor fluxes required to cancel gauge and gravitational anomalies at the cosmological horizon are precisely equal to those of Hawking radiation from it. It should be emphasized that the effective field theory for generic black holes in de Sitter spaces should be formulated within the region between the event horizon (EH) and the cosmological horizon (CH), to integrate out the classically irrelevant ingoing modes at the EH and the classically irrelevant outgoing modes at the CH, respectively.

"A new framework for asset price dynamics is introduced in which the concept of noisy information about future cash flows is used to derive the price processes. In this framework an asset is defined by its cash-flow structure. Each cash flow is modelled by a random variable that can be expressed as a function of a collection of independent random variables called market factors. With each such 'X-factor' we associate a market information process, the values of which are accessible to market agents. Each information process is a sum of two terms; one contains true information about the value of the market factor; the other represents 'noise'. The noise term is modelled by an independent Brownian bridge. The market filtration is assumed to be that generated by the aggregate of the independent information processes. The price of an asset is given by the expectation of the discounted cash flows in the risk-neutral measure, conditional on the information provided by the market filtration. When the cash flows are the dividend payments associated with equities, an explicit model is obtained for the share-price, and the prices of options on dividend-paying assets are derived. Remarkably, the resulting formula for the price of a European call option is of the Black-Scholes-Merton type. The information-based framework also generates a natural explanation for the origin of stochastic volatility. ",0,0
"Low-dimensional systems are beautiful examples of many-body quantum physics. For one-dimensional systems the Luttinger liquid approach provides insight into universal properties. Much is known of the equilibrium state, both in the weakly and strongly interacting regime. However, it remains a challenge to probe the dynamics by which this equilibrium state is reached. Here we present a direct experimental study of the coherence dynamics in both isolated and coupled degenerate 1d Bose gases. Dynamic splitting is used to create two 1d systems in a phase coherent state. The time evolution of the coherence is revealed in local phase shifts of the subsequently observed interference patterns. Completely isolated 1d Bose gases are observed to exhibit a universal sub-exponential coherence decay in excellent agreement with recent predictions by Burkov et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 200404 (2007)]. For two coupled 1d Bose gases the coherence factor is observed to approach a non-zero equilibrium value as predicted by a Bogoliubov approach. This coupled-system decay to finite coherence is the matter wave equivalent of phase locking two lasers by injection. The non-equilibrium dynamics of superfluids plays an important role in a wide range of physical systems, such as superconductors, quantum-Hall systems, superfluid Helium, and spin systems. Our experiments studying coherence dynamics show that 1d Bose gases are ideally suited for investigating this class of phenomena. ",0,0
"Cosmic rays produced in cluster accretion and merger shocks provide pressure to the intracluster medium (ICM) and affect the mass estimates of galaxy clusters. Although direct evidence for cosmic-ray ions in the ICM is still lacking, they produce gamma-ray emission through the decay of neutral pions produced in their collisions with ICM nucleons. We investigate the capability of the Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST) and imaging atmospheric Cerenkov telescopes (IACTs) for constraining the cosmic-ray pressure contribution to the ICM. We show that GLAST can be used to place stringent upper limits, a few per cent for individual nearby rich clusters, on the ratio of pressures of the cosmic rays and thermal gas. We further show that it is possible to place tight (< 10",0,0
"We identify plain evaporation of ions as the fundamental loss mechanism out of a multipole ion trap. Using thermalized negative Cl- ions we find that the evaporative loss rate is proportional to a Boltzmann factor. This thermodynamic description sheds new light on the dynamics of particles in time-varying confining potentials. It specifically allows us to extract the effective depth of the ion trap as the activation energy for evaporation. As a function of the rf amplitude we find two distinct regimes related to the stability of motion of the trapped ions. For low amplitudes the entire trap allows for stable motion and the trap depth increases with the rf field. For larger rf amplitudes, however, rapid energy transfer from the field to the ion motion can occur at large trap radii, which leads to a reduction of the effective trapping volume. In this regime the trap depth decreases again with increasing rf amplitude. We give an analytical parameterization of the trap depth for various multipole traps that allows predictions of the most favorable trapping conditions. ",0,0
"Context:A significant fraction of progenitors for long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are believed to be massive stars. The investigation of long GRBs therefore requires modeling the propagation of ultra-relativistic blastwaves through the circumburst medium surrounding massive stars. We simulate the expansion of an isotropic, adiabatic relativistic fireball into the wind-shaped medium around a massive GRB progenitor. The circumburst medium is composed of a realistically stratified stellar wind zone up to its termination shock, followed by a region of shocked wind characterized by a constant density. Aims: We followed the evolution of the blastwave through all its stages, including the extremely rapid acceleration up to a Lorentz factor 75 flow, its deceleration by interaction with stellar wind, its passage of the wind termination shock, until its propagation through shocked wind. Methods: We used the adaptive mesh refinement versatile advection code to follow the evolution of the fireball. Results: We show that the acceleration from purely thermal to ultra-relativistic kinetic regimes is abrupt and produces an internally structured blastwave. We resolved the structure of this ultra-relativistic shell in all stages, thanks to the adaptive mesh. We comment on the dynamical roles played by forward and reverse shock pairs in the phase of interaction with the free stellar wind and clearly identify the complex shock-dominated structure created when the shell crosses the terminal shock. Conclusion: We show that in our model where the terminal shock is taken relatively close to the massive star, the phase of self-similar deceleration of Blandford-McKee type can only be produced in the constant density, shocked wind zone.

"We describe a numerical method to compute Casimir forces in arbitrary geometries, for arbitrary dielectric and metallic materials, with arbitrary accuracy (given sufficient computational resources). Our approach, based on well-established integration of the mean stress tensor evaluated via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, is designed to directly exploit fast methods developed for classical computational electromagnetism, since it only involves repeated evaluation of the Green's function for imaginary frequencies (equivalently, real frequencies in imaginary time). We develop the approach by systematically examining various formulations of Casimir forces from the previous decades and evaluating them according to their suitability for numerical computation. We illustrate our approach with a simple finite-difference frequency-domain implementation, test it for known geometries such as a cylinder and a plate, and apply it to new geometries. In particular, we show that a piston-like geometry of two squares sliding between metal walls, in both two and three dimensions with both perfect and realistic metallic materials, exhibits a surprising non-monotonic “lateral” force from the walls.

"In spite of the efforts made in the latest years, still there is no comprehensive explanation for the chemical anomalies of globular cluster stars. Among these, the most striking is oxygen depletion, which reaches values down to [O/Fe] -0.4 in most clusters, but in M13 it goes down to less than [O/Fe]- 1. In this work we suggest that the anomalies are due to the super position of two different events: 1) PRIMORDIAL SELF-ENRICHMENT: this is asked to explain the oxygen depletion down to a minimum value [O/Fe]-0.4; 2) EXTRA MIXING IN A FRACTION OF THE STARS ALREADY BORN WITH ANOMALOUS COMPOSITION: these objects, starting with already low [O/Fe], will reduce the oxygen abundance down to the most extreme values. Contrary to other models that invoke extra mixing to explain the chemical anomalies, we suggest that it is active only if there is a fraction of the stars in which the primordial composition is not only oxygen depleted, but also extremely helium rich (Y0.4), as found in a few GCs from their main sequence multiplicity. We propose that the rotational evolution (and an associated extra mixing) of extremely helium rich stars may be affected by the fact that they develop a very small or non existent molecular weight barrier during the evolution. We show that extra mixing in these stars, having initial chemistry that has already been CNO processed, affects mainly the oxygen abundance, and to a much smaller extent if affects the sodium abundance. The model also predicts a large fluorine depletion concomitant with the oxygen depletion, and a further enhancement of the surface helium abundance, which reaches values close to Y=0.5 in the computed models. We stress that, in this tentative explanation, those stars that are primordially O–depleted, but ARE NOT extremely helium rich do not suffer deep extra mixing. ",0,0

"We have investigated the influence of nuclear parameters such as black hole (BH) mass and photoionizing luminosity on the FRI/FRII transition in a sample of nearby (z<0.2) 3CR radio galaxies. The sample was observed with medium-resolution, optical spectroscopy and contains some galaxies with unpublished velocity dispersion measurements and emission-line fluxes. Measured velocity dispersions are 130-340 km/s with a mean of 216 km/s. Converting to BH mass, we find that the BH mass distribution is identical for FRIs and FRIIs, with a mean of approximately 2.5x10^8 Msun. We convert [OII] and [OIII] emission-line luminosities to photoionizing luminosity under the assumption that the gas is ionized by the nuclear UV continuum. Most of the galaxies with FRI morphology and/or low-excitation emission-line spectra have progressively lower BH masses at lower photoionizing (and jet) luminosities. This agrees with the Ledlow-Owen relation which states that the radio luminosity at the FRI/FRII transition depends on the optical luminosity of the host, L_radioL_optical^1.8, because both L_radio and L_optical relate to AGN nuclear parameters. When recasting the Ledlow-Owen relation into BH mass versus photoionizing and jet luminosity, we find that the recasted relation describes the sample quite well. The FRI/FRII transition occurs at approximately an order of magnitude lower luminosity relative to the Eddington luminosity than the soft-to-hard transition in X-ray binaries. This difference is consistent with the Ledlow-Owen relation, which predicts a weak BH mass dependence in the transition luminosity. We conclude that the FRI/FRII dichotomy is caused by a combination of external and nuclear factors, with the latter dominating. ",0,0
"For the first time we apply the methodologies of nonlinear analysis to investigate atomic matter. We use these methods in the analysis of Atomic Weights and of Mass Number of atomic nuclei. Using the AutoCorrelation Function and Mutual Information we establish the presence of nonlinear effects in the mechanism of increasing mass of atomic nuclei considered as a function of the atomic number. We find that increasing mass is divergent, possibly chaotic. We also investigate the possible existence of a Power Law for atomic nuclei and, using also the technique of the variogram, we conclude that a fractal regime could superintend to the mechanism of increasing mass for nuclei. Finally, using the Hurst exponent, evidence is obtained that the mechanism of increasing mass in atomic nuclei is in the fractional Brownian regime. The most interesting results are obtained by using Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA). New recurrences, psudoperiodicities, self-resemblance and class of self-similarities are identified with values of determinism showing oscillating values indicating the presence of more or less stability during the process of increasing mass of atomic nuclei. In brief, new regimes of regularities are identified for atomic nuclei that deserve to be studied by future researches. In particular an accurate analysis of binding energy values by nonlinear methods is further required. ",0,0
"Intracellular recordings of cortical neurons in vivo display intense subthreshold membrane potential (Vm) activity. The power spectral density (PSD) of the Vm displays a power-law structure at high frequencies (>50 Hz) with a slope of about -2.5. This type of frequency scaling cannot be accounted for by traditional models, as either single-compartment models or models based on reconstructed cell morphologies display a frequency scaling with a slope close to -4. This slope is due to the fact that the membrane resistance is 'short-circuited' by the capacitance for high frequencies, a situation which may not be realistic. Here, we integrate non-ideal capacitors in cable equations to reflect the fact that the capacitance cannot be charged instantaneously. We show that the resulting 'non-ideal' cable model can be solved analytically using Fourier transforms. Numerical simulations using a ball-and-stick model yield membrane potential activity with similar frequency scaling as in the experiments. We also discuss the consequences of using non-ideal capacitors on other cellular properties such as the transmission of high frequencies, which is boosted in non-ideal cables, or voltage attenuation in dendrites. These results suggest that cable equations based on non-ideal capacitors should be used to capture the behavior of neuronal membranes at high frequencies. ",0,0
"We present a theoretical study of the electronic transport through a many-level quantum dot driven by time-dependent signals applied at the contacts to the leads. If the barriers oscillate out of phase the system operates like a turnstile pump under a finite constant bias, as observed in the experiments of Kouwenhoven et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 67, 1626 (1991)]. The time-dependent currents and their averages over succesive pumping periods are computed from the Keldysh formalism for tight-binding models. The calculation considers a sudden application of the pumping potentials at t=0 which leads to transient features of the time-dependent and averaged currents during the first pumping cycles which turn out to be important in the high-frequency regime. We show that in the transient regime the efficiency of the system as a pump is rather poor because it mainly absorbs charge from both leads in order to fill the levels located below the bias window. Under a finite bias and a low-frequency pumping signal the charge transferred across the system depends on the number of levels located within the bias window. The internal charge dynamics and the role of energy sidebands are investigated. The so called satellite peaks of the averaged current are observed also in the transient regime. ",0,0
"The holographic description of the three-dimensional Kerr-de Sitter space with a gravitational Chern-Simons term is studied, in the context of dS/CFT correspondence. The space has only one (cosmological) event horizon and its mass and angular momentum are identified from the holographic energy-momentum tensor at the asymptotic infinity. The thermodynamic entropy of the cosmological horizon is computed directly from the first law of thermodynamics, with the usual Hawking temperature, and it is found that the usual Gibbons-Hawking entropy is modified. It is remarked that, due to the gravitational Chern-Simons term, (a) the results go beyond analytic continuation from AdS, (b) the maximum-mass/N-bound conjecture may be violated, and (c) the three-dimensional cosmology is chiral. A statistical mechanical computation of the entropy, from a Cardy-like formula for a dual CFT at the asymptotic boundary, is discussed. Some technical difference in the Chern-Simons energy-momentum tensor, from literatures is remarked also. ",0,0
"We present the results from simultaneous chandra and rxte observations of the X-ray bright Broad-Line Radio Galaxy (BLRG) 3C 382. The long (120 ks) exposure with chandra HETG allows a detailed study of the soft X-ray continuum and of the narrow component of the Fe Kalpha line. The rxte PCA data are used to put an upper limit on the broad line component and constrain the hard X-ray continuum. A strong soft excess below 1 keV is observed in the time-averaged HETG spectrum, which can be parameterized with a steep power law or a thermal model. The flux variability at low energies indicates that the origin of the soft excess cannot be entirely ascribed to the circumnuclear diffuse emission, detected by chandra on scales of 20-30 arcsec (22-33 kpc). A narrow (sigma<90 eV) Fe Kalpha line (with EW< 100 eV) is observed by the chandra HEG. Similar values for the line parameters are measured by the rxte PCA, suggesting that the contribution from a broad line component is negligible. The fact that the exposure is split into two observations taken three days apart allows us to investigate the spectral and temporal evolution of the source on different timescales. Significant flux variability associated with spectral changes is observed on timescales of hours and days. The spectral variability is similar to that observed in radio-quiet AGN ruling out a jet-dominated origin of the X-rays. ",0,0
"The complete Type IIB supergravity solutions with 16 supersymmetries are obtained on the manifold AdS_4 × S^2 × S^2 ×Σ with SO(2,3) × SO(3) × SO(3) symmetry in terms of two holomorphic functions on a Riemann surface Σ, which generally has a boundary. This is achieved by reducing the BPS equations using the above symmetry requirements, proving that all solutions of the BPS equations solve the full Type IIB supergravity field equations, mapping the BPS equations onto a new integrable system akin to the Liouville and Sine-Gordon theories, and mapping this integrable system to a linear equation which can be solved exactly. Amongst the infinite class of solutions, a non-singular Janus solution is identified which provides the AdS/CFT dual of the maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills interface theory discovered recently.

For this purpose, the integral electron energy spectrum is measured close to the endpoint of molecular tritium beta decay. The endpoint, together with the neutrino mass, should be fitted from the KATRIN data as a free parameter. The right-handed couplings change the electron energy spectrum close to the endpoint, therefore they have some effect also to the precise neutrino mass determination.

"Complex networks with expanding dimensions are studied, where the networks may be directed and weighted, and network nodes are varying in discrete time in the sense that some new nodes may be added and some old nodes may be removed from time to time. A model of such networks in computer data transmission is discussed. Each node on the network has fixed dimensionality, while the dimension of the whole network is defined by the total number of nodes. Based on the spectacular properties of data transmission on computer networks, some new concepts of stable and unstable networks differing from the classical Lyapunov stability are defined. In particular, a special unstable network model, called devil network, is introduced and discussed. It is further found that a variety of structures and connection weights affects the network stability substantially. Several criteria on stability, instability, and devil network are established for a rather general class of networks, where some conditions are actually necessary and sufficient. Mathematically, this paper makes a first attempt to rigorously formulate a fundamental issue of modeling discrete linear time-varying systems with expanding dimensions and study their basic stability property.

"21-cm emission from neutral hydrogen during and before the epoch of cosmic reionisation is gravitationally lensed by material at all lower redshifts. Low-frequency radio observations of this emission can be used to reconstruct the projected mass distribution of foreground material, both light and dark.

We use the Millennium Simulation to simulate large-area maps of the lensing convergence with the noise, resolution and redshift-weighting achievable with a variety of idealised observation programmes. We find that the signal-to-noise of 21-cm lens maps can far exceed that of any map made using galaxy lensing. If the irreducible noise limit can be reached with a sufficiently large radio telescope, the projected convergence map provides a high-fidelity image of the true matter distribution, allowing the dark matter halos of individual galaxies to be viewed directly, and giving a wealth of statistical and morphological information about the relative distributions of mass and light.

"We study the growth of cosmological perturbations in the model of Lorentz-violating massive gravity. The Friedman equation in this model acquires an unconventional term due to the Lorentz-breaking condensates which has the equation of state w = -1 / (3 gamma) with gamma being a free parameter taking values outside of the range [0,1/3]. Apart from the standard contributions, the perturbations above the Friedmann background contain an extra piece which is proportional to an arbitrary function theta(x) of the space coordinates. This function appears as an integration constant and corresponds to a non-propagating scalar mode which may, however, become dynamical with the account of the higher-derivative corrections. For -1 < gamma < 0 and gamma = 1 the “anomalous” perturbations grow slower than the standard ones and thus the model is compatible with observations. Whether the model is experimentally acceptable at other values of γdepends on the value of the function theta(x) at the beginning of the radiation-dominated epoch. ",0,0
"Current and upcoming cosmological observations allow us to probe structures on smaller and smaller scales, entering highly nonlinear regimes. In order to obtain theoretical predictions in these regimes, large cosmological simulations have to be carried out. The promised high accuracy from observations make the simulation task very demanding: the simulations have to be at least as accurate as the observations. This requirement can only be fulfilled by carrying out an extensive code validation program. The first step of such a program is the comparison of different cosmology codes including gravitation interactions only. In this paper we extend a recently carried out code comparison project to include five more simulation codes. We restrict our analysis to a small cosmological volume which allows us to investigate properties of halos. For the matter power spectrum and the mass function, the previous results hold, with the codes agreeing at the 10",0,0
"Atmospheric water vapor causes significant undesired phase fluctuations for the Submillimeter Array (SMA) interferometer, particularly in its highest frequency observing band of 690 GHz. One proposed solution to this atmospheric effect is to observe simultaneously at two separate frequency bands of 230 and 690 GHz. Although the phase fluctuations have a smaller magnitude at the lower frequency, they can be measured more accurately and on shorter timescales due to the greater sensitivity of the array to celestial point source calibrators at this frequency. In theory, we can measure the atmospheric phase fluctuations in the 230 GHz band, scale them appropriately with frequency, and apply them to the data in 690 band during the post-observation calibration process. The ultimate limit to this atmospheric phase calibration scheme will be set by the instrumental phase stability of the IF and LO systems. We describe the methodology and initial results of the phase stability characterization of the IF and LO systems. ",0,0

"Compton scattering of X-rays in the bulk flow of the accretion column in magnetic cataclysmic variables (mCVs) can significantly shift photon energies. We present Monte Carlo simulations based on a nonlinear algorithm demonstrating the effects of Compton scattering on the H-like, He-like and neutral Fe K alpha lines produced in the post-shock region of the accretion column. The peak line emissivities of the photons in the post-shock flow are taken into consideration and frequency shifts due to Doppler effects are also included. We find that line profiles are most distorted by Compton scattering effects in strongly magnetized mCVs with a low white dwarf mass and high mass accretion rate and which are viewed at an oblique angle with respect to the accretion column. The resulting line profiles are most sensitive to the inclination angle. We have also explored the effects of modifying the accretion column width and using a realistic emissivity profile. We find that these do not have a significant overall effect on the resulting line profiles. A comparison of our simulated line spectra with high resolution Chandra/HETGS observations of the mCV GK Per indicates that a wing feature redward of the 6.4 keV line may result from Compton recoil near the base of the accretion column.

"A Suzaku observation of the nucleus of the radio-loud AGN Centaurus A in 2005 has yielded a broadband spectrum spanning 0.3 to 250 keV. The net exposure times after screening were: 70 ks per X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (XIS) camera, 60.8 ks for the Hard X-ray Detector (HXD) PIN, and 17.1 ks for the HXD-GSO. The hard X-rays are fit by two power-laws of the same slope, absorbed by columns of 1.5 and 7 * 10^23 cm^-2 respectively. The spectrum is consistent with previous suggestions that the power-law components are X-ray emission from the sub-pc VLBI jet and from Bondi accretion at the core, but it is also consistent with a partial covering interpretation. The soft band is dominated by thermal emission from the diffuse plasma and is fit well by a two-temperature VAPEC model, plus a third power-law component to account for scattered nuclear emission, jet emission, and emission from X-ray Binaries and other point sources. Narrow fluorescent emission lines from Fe, Si, S, Ar, Ca and Ni are detected. The Fe K alpha line width yields a 200 light-day lower limit on the distance from the black hole to the line-emitting gas. Fe, Ca, and S K-shell absorption edges are detected. Elemental abundances are constrained via absorption edge depths and strengths of the fluorescent and diffuse plasma emission lines. The high metallicity ([Fe/H]=+0.1) of the circumnuclear material suggests that it could not have originated in the relatively metal-poor outer halo unless enrichment by local star formation has occurred. Relative abundances are consistent with enrichment from Type II and Ia supernovae. ",0,0
"Using modified gravity with non-linear terms of curvature, R^2 and R^(r +2) (with r being the positive real number and R being the scalar curvature), cosmological scenario,beginning at the Planck scale, is obtained. Here, a unified picture of cosmology is obtained from f(R)- gravity. In this scenario, universe begins with power-law inflation, followed by deceleration and acceleration in the late universe as well as possible collapse of the universe in future. It is different from f(R)- dark energy models with non-linear curvature terms assumed as dark energy. Here, dark energy terms are induced by linear as well as non-linear terms of curvature in Friedmann equation being derived from modified gravity.It is also interesting to see that, in this model, dark radiation and dark matter terms emerge spontaneously from the gravitational sector. It is found that dark energy, obtained here, behaves as quintessence in the early universe and phantom in the late universe. Moreover, analogous to brane-tension in brane-gravity inspired Friedmann equation, a tension term λ arises here being called as cosmic tension. It is found that, in the late universe, Friedmann equation (obtained here) contains a term - ρ^2/2λ (ρ being the phantom energy density) analogous to a similar term in Friedmann equation with loop quantum effects, if λ > 0 and brane-gravity correction when λ < 0.

"It has been observed that particular rate-1/2 partially systematic parallel concatenated convolutional codes (PCCCs) can achieve a lower error floor than that of their rate-1/3 parent codes. Nevertheless, good puncturing patterns can only be identified by means of an exhaustive search, whilst convergence towards low bit error probabilities can be problematic when the systematic output of a rate-1/2 partially systematic PCCC is heavily punctured. In this paper, we present and study a family of rate-1/2 partially systematic PCCCs, which we call pseudo-randomly punctured codes. We evaluate their bit error rate performance and we show that they always yield a lower error floor than that of their rate-1/3 parent codes. Furthermore, we compare analytic results to simulations and we demonstrate that their performance converges towards the error floor region, owning to the moderate puncturing of their systematic output. Consequently, we propose pseudo-random puncturing as a means of improving the bandwidth efficiency of a PCCC and simultaneously lowering its error floor. ",0,0
"General hypersurface layers are considered in order to describe brane-worlds and shell cosmologies. No restriction is placed on the causal character of the hypersurface which may thus have internal changes of signature. Strengthening the results in our previous letter [1], we confirm that a good, regular and consistent description of signature change is achieved in these brane/shells scenarios, while keeping the hypersurface and the bulk completely regular. Our formalism allows for a unified description of the traditional timelike branes/shells together with the signature-changing, or pure null, ones. This allows for a detailed comparison of the results in both situations. An application to the case of hypersurface layers in static bulks is presented, leading to the general Robertson-Walker geometry on the layer –with a possible signature change. Explicit examples on anti de Sitter bulks are then studied. The permitted behaviours in different settings (Z_2-mirror branes, asymmetric shells, signature-changing branes) are analysed in detail. We show in particular that (i) in asymmetric shells there is an upper bound for the energy density, and (ii) that the energy density within the brane vanishes when approaching a change of signature. The description of a signature change as a `singularity' seen from within the brane is considered. We also find new relations between the fundamental constants in the brane/shell, its tension, and the cosmological and gravitational constants of the bulk, independently of the existence or not of a change of signature.

"New information on short/hard gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is being gathered thanks to the discovery of their optical and X-ray afterglows. However, some key aspects are still poorly understood, including the collimation level of the outflow, the duration of the central engine activity, and the properties of the progenitor systems. We want to constrain the physical properties of the short GRB 050724 and of its host galaxy, and make some inferences on the global short GRB population. We present optical observations of the afterglow of GRB 050724 and of its host galaxy, significantly expanding the existing dataset for this event. We compare our results with models, complementing them with available measurements from the literature. We study the afterglow light curve and spectrum including X-ray data. We also present observations of the host galaxy. The observed optical emission was likely related to the large flare observed in the X-ray light curve. The apparent steep decay was therefore not due to the jet effect. Available data are indeed consistent with low collimation, in turn implying a large energy release, comparable to that of long GRBs. The flare properties also constrain the internal shock mechanism, requiring a large Lorentz factor contrast between the colliding shells. This implies that the central engine was active at late times, rather than ejecting all shells simultaneously. The host galaxy has red colors and no ongoing star formation, consistent with previous findings on this GRB. However, it is not a pure elliptical, and has some faint spiral structure. GRB 050724 provides the most compelling case for association between a short burst and a galaxy with old stellar population. It thus plays a pivotal role in constraining progenitors models, which should allow for long delays between birth and explosion. ",0,0
"It is known that when hard spheres are added to a pure system of hard rods the stability of the smectic phase may be greatly enhanced, and that this effect can be rationalised in terms of depletion forces. In the present paper we first study the effect of orientational order on depletion forces in this particular binary system, comparing our results with those obtained adopting the usual approximation of considering the rods parallel and their orientations frozen. We consider mixtures with rods of different aspect ratios and spheres of different diameters, and we treat them within Onsager theory. Our results indicate that depletion effects, and consequently smectic stability, decrease significantly as a result of orientational disorder in the smectic phase when compared with corresponding data based on the frozen–orientation approximation. These results are discussed in terms of the τ parameter, which has been proposed as a convenient measure of depletion strength. We present closed expressions for τ, and show that it is intimately connected with the depletion potential. We then analyse the effect of particle geometry by comparing results pertaining to systems of parallel rods of different shapes (spherocylinders, cylinders and parallelepipeds). We finally provide results based on the Zwanzig approximation of a Fundamental–Measure density–functional theory applied to mixtures of parallelepipeds and cubes of different sizes. In this case, we show that the τ parameter exhibits a linear asymptotic behaviour in the limit of large values of the hard–rod aspect ratio, in conformity with Onsager theory, as well as in the limit of large values of the ratio of rod breadth to cube side length, d, in contrast to Onsager approximation, which predicts τ∼ d^3.

"Cornell University, the California Institute for Technology, and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory are jointly studying the construction of a 25 m diameter telescope for submillimeter astronomy on a high mountain in northern Chile. This Cornell Caltech Atacama Telescope (CCAT) will combine high sensitivity, a wide field of view, and a broad wavelength range to provide an unprecedented capability for deep, large area, multi-color submillimeter surveys to complement narrow field, high resolution studies with ALMA. CCAT observations will address fundamental themes in contemporary astronomy, notably the formation and evolution of galaxies, the nature of the dark matter and dark energy that comprise most of the content of the universe, the formation of stars and planets, the conditions in circumstellar disks, and the conditions during the early history of the Solar system. The candidate CCAT site, at 5600 m in northern Chile, enjoys superb observing conditions. To accommodate large format bolometer cameras, CCAT is designed with a 20 arcmin field of view. CCAT will incorporate closed loop active control of its segmented primary mirror to maintain a half wavefront error of 10 mum rms or less. Instrumentation under consideration includes both short (650 mum-200 mum) and long (2 mm-750 mum) wavelength bolometer cameras, direct detection spectrometers, and heterodyne receiver arrays. The University of Colorado, a Canadian university consortium, and the UK Astronomy Technology Centre on behalf of the UK community are pursuing participation in the CCAT consortium. When complete early in the next decade, CCAT will be the largest and most sensitive facility of its class as well as the highest altitude astronomical facility on Earth. ",0,0
"In this chapter we review our findings on the bonding structure and growth mechanisms of carbon-based thin solid films with fullerene-like (FL) microstructure. The so-called FL arrangements arise from the curvature and cross-linking of basal planes in graphitic-like structures, partially resembling that of molecular fullerenes. This three-dimensional superstructure takes advantage of the strength of planar pi bonds in sp2 hybrids and confers the material interesting mechanical properties, such as high hardness, high elastic recovery, low-friction and wear-resistance. These properties can be tailored by controlling the curvature, size and connectivity of the FL arrangements, making these materials promising coatings for tribological applications. We have focused our interest mostly on carbon nitride (CNx) since nitrogen promotes the formation of FL arrangements at low substrate temperatures and they are emerging over pure carbon coatings in tribological applications such as protective overcoats in magnetic hard disks. We address structural issues such as origin of plane curvature, nature of the cross-linking sites and sp2 clustering, together with growth mechanisms based on the role of film-forming precursors, chemical re-sputtering or concurrent ion assistance during growth.

"We conjecture that the set of all Hilbert functions of (artinian) level algebras enjoys a very natural form of regularity, which we call the Interval Conjecture (IC): If, for some positive integer α, (1,h_1,...,h_i,...,h_e) and (1,h_1,...,h_i+α ,...,h_e) are both level h-vectors, then (1,h_1,...,h_i+β ,...,h_e) is also level for each integer β =0,1,..., α . In the Gorenstein case, i.e. when h_e=1, we also supply the Gorenstein Interval Conjecture (GIC), which naturally generalizes the IC, and basically states that the same property simultaneously holds for any two symmetric entries, say h_i and h_e-i, of a Gorenstein h-vector.These conjectures are inspired by the research performed in this area over the last few years. A series of recent results seems to indicate that it will be nearly impossible to characterize explicitly the sets of all Gorenstein or of all level Hilbert functions. Therefore, our conjectures would at least provide the existence of a very strong - and natural - form of order in the structure of such important and complicated sets.We are still far from proving the conjectures at this point. However, we will already solve a few interesting cases, especially when it comes to the IC, in this paper. Among them, that of Gorenstein h-vectors of socle degree 4, that of level h-vectors of socle degree 2, and that of non-unimodal level h-vectors of socle degree 3 and any given codimension. ",0,0
"In this paper we study the confluence of two regular singular points of the hypergeometric equation into an irregular one. We study the consequence of the divergence of solutions at the irregular singular point for the unfolded system. Our study covers a full neighborhood of the origin in the confluence parameter space. In particular, we show how the divergence of solutions at the irregular singular point explains the presence of logarithmic terms in the solutions at a regular singular point of the unfolded system. For this study, we consider values of the confluence parameter taken in two sectors covering the complex plane. In each sector, we study the monodromy of a first integral of a Riccati system related to the hypergeometric equation. Then, on each sector, we include the presence of logarithmic terms into a continuous phenomenon and view a Stokes multiplier related to a 1-summable solution as the limit of an obstruction that prevents a pair of eigenvectors of the monodromy operators, one at each singular point, to coincide.

"Inversion symmetry breaking allows contrasted circular dichroism in different k-space regions, which takes the extreme form of optical selection rules for interband transitions at high symmetry points. In materials where band-edges occur at noncentral valleys, this enables valley dependent interplay of electrons with light of different circular polarizations, in analogy to spin dependent optical activities in semiconductors. This discovery is in perfect harmony with the previous finding of valley contrasted Bloch band features of orbital magnetic moment and Berry curvatures from inversion symmetry breaking [Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 236809 (2007)]. A universal connection is revealed between the k-resolved optical oscillator strength of interband transitions, the orbital magnetic moment and the Berry curvatures, which also provides a principle for optical measurement of orbital magnetization and intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity in ferromagnetic systems. The general physics is demonstrated in graphene where inversion symmetry breaking leads to valley contrasted optical selection rule for interband transitions. We discuss graphene based valley optoelectronics applications where light polarization information can be interconverted with electronic information. ",0,0
"In this letter, a theoretical method for the analysis of diffusive flux/current to limited scale self-affine random fractals is presented and compared with experimentally measured electrochemical current for such roughness. The theory explains the several experimental findings of the temporal scale invariance as well as deviation from this of current transients in terms of three dominant fractal parameters for the limited-length scales of roughness. This theoretical method is based on limited scale power-law characterization of the interfacial roughness spectrum and the solution of diffusion equation under the diffusion-limited boundary conditions on rough interfaces. More broadly, these calculations challenges the earlier belief that the anomalous behavior is solely dependent on fractal dimension of roughness and highlight the potential to apply this equation for the scale invariant roughness determination. Finally, the validity of theoretical result is tested with extensive experimental data. ",0,0
"Prominent ethical and policy issues such as affirmative action and female enrollment in science and engineering revolve around the idea that diversity is good. However, even though diversity is an ambiguous concept, a precise definition is seldom provided. We show that diversity may be construed as a factual description, a craving for symmetry, an intrinsic good, an instrumental good, a symptom, or a side effect. These acceptions differ vastly in their nature and properties. The first one cannot lead to any action and the second one is mistaken. Diversity as intrinsic good is a mere opinion, which cannot be concretely applied; moreover, the most commonly invoked forms of diversity (sexual and racial) are not intrinsically good. On the other hand, diversity as instrumental good can be evaluated empirically and can give rise to policies, but these may be very weak. Finally, symptoms and side effects are not actually about diversity. We consider the example of female enrollment in science and engineering, interpreting the various arguments found in the literature in light of this polysemy.Keywords: ethics, policy, higher education, female students, minority students, affirmative action ",0,0
"The magnetic field in an accretion disk is estimated assuming that all of the angular momentum within prescribed accretion disk radii is removed by a jet. The magnetic field estimated at the base of the jet is extrapolated to the blazar emission region using a model for a relativistic axisymmetric jet combined with some simplifying assumptions based on the relativistic nature of the flow. The extrapolated magnetic field is compared with estimates based upon the synchrotron and inverse Compton emission from three blazars, MKN 501, MKN 421 and PKS 2155-304. The magnetic fields evaluated from pure synchrotron self- Compton models are inconsistent with the magnetic fields extrapolated in this way. However, in two cases inverse Compton models in which a substantial part of the soft photon field is generated locally agree well, mainly because these models imply magnetic field strengths which are closer to being consistent with Poynting flux dominated jets. This comparison is based on estimating the mass accretion rate from the jet energy flux. Further comparisons along these lines will be facilitated by independent estimates of the mass accretion rate in blazars and by more detailed models for jet propagation near the black hole. ",0,0
"We have had several talks recently reviewing 11 years of exoplanet discoveries through radial velocity variations, or from transits, or from microlensing. More than 200 exoplanets have been found, including some around pulsars that we do not discuss here.My physical definition for a planet is a roughly spherical, self-gravitating body more massive than 10**26 g formed from the leftover material in a protostellar disk after the protostar forms. Radiation from the protostar pushes the inner wall of the disk outward. The material agglomerates and forms planets in radial sequence. The outer planets are formed slowly by classical dynamical mechanisms acting in the snow zone. Planets have dense cores because of agglomeration.Not one of the exoplanets discovered thus far is a planet. They are cryptoplanets formed from matter ejected by protostars. When protostars have excessive infall at high latitudes, they partially balance angular momentum through outflow at the equator as they spin up. The ejected matter is trapped in the magnetic torus formed between the star and the disk, like a tokamak. The tokamak eventully reconnects and magnetic compression forms self-gravitating remnants trapped and compressed by a closed spherical magnetic field, spheromaks. Cooled spheromaks are cryptoplanets. They orbit near the star. They can merge with each other or fall into the star or be ejected. They can grow by accreting gas. They have a low density core and abundances characteristic of the protostar. Their masses, radii, densities, and orbits are random, and are inconsistent with the parameters for planets. They tend to have lower density than planets. ",0,0
"Chandra and VLA observations of the symbiotic star R Aqr in 2004 reveal significant changes over the three to four year interval between these observations and previous observations taken with the VLA in 1999 and with Chandra in 2000. This paper reports on the evolution of the outer thermal X-ray lobe-jets and radio jets. The emission from the outer X-ray lobe-jets lies farther away from the central binary than the outer radio jets, and comes from material interpreted as being shock heated to10^6 K, a likely result of collision between high speed material ejected from the central binary and regions of enhanced gas density. Between 2000 and 2004, the Northeast (NE) outer X-ray lobe-jet moved out away from the central binary, with an apparent projected motion of580 km s^-1. The Southwest (SW) outer X-ray lobe-jet almost disappeared between 2000 and 2004, presumably due to adiabatic expansion and cooling. The NE radio bright spot also moved away from the central binary between 2000 and 2004, but with a smaller apparent velocity than of the NE X-ray bright spot. The SW outer lobe-jet was not detected in the radio in either 1999 or 2004. The density and mass of the X-ray emitting material is estimated.

"This paper focuses on the issue of energy efficiency in wireless data networks through a game theoretic approach. The case considered is that in which each user is allowed to vary its transmit power, spreading code, and uplink receiver in order to maximize its own utility, which is here defined as the ratio of data throughput to transmit power. In particular, the case in which linear multiuser detectors are employed at the receiver is treated first, and, then, the more challenging case in which non-linear decision feedback multiuser receivers are adopted is addressed. It is shown that, for both receivers, the problem at hand of utility maximization can be regarded as a non-cooperative game, and it is proved that a unique Nash equilibrium point exists. Simulation results show that significant performance gains can be obtained through both non-linear processing and spreading code optimization; in particular, for systems with a number of users not larger than the processing gain, remarkable gains come from spreading code optimization, while, for overloaded systems, the largest gainscome from the use of non-linear processing. In every case, however, the non-cooperative games proposed here are shown to outperform competing alternatives. ",0,0
"The photon box thought experiment can be considered a forerunner of the EPR-experiment: by performing suitable measurements on the box it is possible to “prepare” the photon, long after it has escaped, in either of two complementary states. Consistency requires that the corresponding box measurements be complementary as well. At first sight it seems, however, that these measurements can be jointly performed with arbitrary precision: they pertain to different systems (the center of mass of the box and an internal clock, respectively). But this is deceptive. As we show by explicit calculation, although the relevant quantities are simultaneously measurable, they develop non-vanishing commutators when calculated back to the time of escape of the photon. This justifies Bohr's qualitative arguments in a precise way; and it illustrates how the details of the dynamics conspire to guarantee the requirements of complementarity. In addition, our calculations exhibit a “fine structure” in the distribution of the uncertainties over the complementary quantities: depending on when the box measurement is performed, the resulting quantum description of the photon differs. This brings us close to the argumentation of the later EPR thought experiment. ",0,0
"The dynamics of receding contact lines is investigated experimentally through controlled perturbations of a meniscus in a dip coating experiment. We first characterize stationary menisci and their breakdown at the coating transition. It is then shown that the dynamics of both liquid deposition and long-wavelength perturbations adiabatically follow these stationary states. This provides a first experimental access to the entire bifurcation diagram of dynamical wetting, confirming the hydrodynamic theory developed in Part 1. In contrast to quasi-static theories based on a dynamic contact angle, we demonstrate that the transition strongly depends on the large scale flow geometry. We then establish the dispersion relation for large wavenumbers, for which we find that sigma is linear in q. The speed dependence of sigma is well described by hydrodynamic theory, in particular the absence of diverging time-scales at the critical point. Finally, we highlight some open problems related to contact angle hysteresis that lead beyond the current description. ",0,0
"The geometric constructions are elaborated on (semi) Riemannian manifolds and vector bundles provided with nonintegrable distributions defining nonlinear connection structures induced canonically by metric tensors. Such spaces are called nonholonomic manifolds and described by two equivalent linear connections also induced in unique forms by a metric tensor (the Levi Civita and the canonical distinguished connection, d-connection). The lifts of geometric objects on tangent bundles are performed for certain classes of d-connections and frame transforms when the Riemann tensor is parametrized by constant matrix coefficients. For such configurations, the flows of non-stretching curves and corresponding bi-Hamilton and solitonic hierarchies encode information about Ricci flow evolution, Einstein spaces and exact solutions in gravity and geometric mechanics. The applied methods were elaborated formally in Finsler geometry and allows us to develop the formalism for generalized Riemann-Finsler and Lagrange spaces. Nevertheless, all geometric constructions can be equivalently re-defined for the Levi Civita connections and holonomic frames on (semi) Riemannian manifolds. ",0,0
"In the classical one-dimensional solution of fluid dynamics equations all unknown functions depend only on time t and Cartesian coordinate x. Although fluid spreads in all directions (velocity vector has three components) the whole picture of motion is relatively simple: trajectory of one fluid particle from plane x=const completely determines motion of the whole plane. Basing on the symmetry analysis of differential equations we propose generalization of this solution allowing movements in different directions of fluid particles belonging to plane x=const. At that, all functions but an angle determining the direction of particle's motion depend on t and x only, whereas the angle depends on all coordinates. In this solution the whole picture of motion superposes from identical trajectories placed under different angles in 3D space. Orientations of the trajectories are restricted by a finite relation possessing functional arbitrariness. The solution describes three-dimensional nonlinear processes and singularities in infinitely conducting plasma, gas or incompressible liquid. ",0,0

"We study scaling relations of compressible strongly magnetized turbulence. We find a good correspondence of our results with the Fleck (1996) model of compressible hydrodynamic turbulence. In particular, we find that the density-weighted velocity, i.e. u ≡ρ^1/3 v, proposed in Kritsuk et al. (2007) obeys the Kolmogorov scaling, i.e. E_u(k)∼ k^-5/3 for the high Mach number turbulence. Similarly, we find that the exponents of the third order structure functions for u stay equal to unity for the all the Mach numbers studied. The scaling of higher order correlations obeys the She-Leveque (1994) scalings corresponding to the two-dimensional dissipative structures, and this result does not change with the Mach number either. In contrast to v which exhibits different scaling parallel and perpendicular to the local magnetic field, the scaling of u is similar in both directions. In addition, we find that the peaks of density create a hierarchy in which both physical and column densities decrease with the scale in accordance to the Fleck (1996) predictions. This hierarchy can be related ubiquitous small ionized and neutral structures (SINS) in the interstellar gas. We believe that studies of statistics of the column density peaks can provide both consistency check for the turbulence velocity studies and insight into supersonic turbulence, when the velocity information is not available.

The measured pulse shapes are deconvolved for interstellar pulse broadening, yielding a pulse-broadening time of 670±100 μs, and the implied strength of scattering (scattering measure) is the lowest that is estimated towards the Crab nebula from observations made so far. The sensitivity of the system is largely dictated by the sky background, and our simple equipment is capable of detecting pulses that are brighter than ∼9 kJy in amplitude. The brightest giant pulse detected in our data has a peak amplitude of ∼50 kJy, and the implied brightness temperature is 10^31.6 K. We discuss the giant pulse detection prospects with the full MWA-LFD system. With a sensitivity over two orders of magnitude larger than the prototype equipment, the full system will be capable of detecting such bright giant pulses out to a wide range of Galactic distances; from ∼8 to ∼30 kpc depending on the frequency. The MWA-LFD will thus be a highly promising instrument for the studies of giant pulses and other fast radio transients at low frequencies. ",0,0
"We present SEST observations of the molecular environment ahead of the southern Herbig-Haro object 188 (HH188), associated with the low-mass protostar Re4 IRS. We have also used the SuperCosmos Halpha survey to search for Halpha emission associated with the Re4 IRS - HH188 region. The aim of the present work is to study the properties of the molecular gas and to better characterize this southern star forming region. We mapped the HCO+ 3-2 and H13CO+ 1-0 emission around the YSO and took spectra of the CH3OH 2(0)-1(0)A+ and 2(-1)-1(-1)E and SO 6(5)-5(4) towards the central source. Column densities are derived and different scenarios are considered to explain the origin of the molecular emission. HCO+ arises from a relatively compact region around the YSO; however, its peak emission is displaced to the south following the outflow direction. Our chemical analysis indicates that a plausible scenario is that most of the emission arises from the cold, illuminated dense gas ahead of the HH188 object. We have also found that HH188, a high excitation object, seems to be part of a parsec scale and highly collimated HH system. Re4 IRS is probably a binary protostellar system, in the late Class 0 or Class I phase. One of the protostars, invisible in the near-IR, seems to power the HH188 system. ",0,0
"We have been monitoring Supernova (SN) 1987A with Chandra X-Ray Observatory since 1999. We present a review of previous results from our Chandra observations, and some preliminary results from new Chandra data obtained in 2006 and 2007. High resolution imaging and spectroscopic studies of SN 1987A with Chandra reveal that X-ray emission of SN 1987A originates from the hot gas heated by interaction of the blast wave with the ring-like dense circumstellar medium (CSM) that was produced by the massive progenitor's equatorial stellar winds before the SN explosion. The blast wave is now sweeping through dense CSM all around the inner ring, and thus SN 1987A is rapidly brightening in soft X-rays. At the age of 20 yr (as of 2007 January), X-ray luminosity of SN 1987A is L_ X ∼ 2.4 × 10^36 ergs s^-1 in the 0.5-10 keV band. X-ray emission is described by two-component plane shock model with electron temperatures of kT ∼ 0.3 and 2 keV. As the shock front interacts with dense CSM all around the inner ring, the X-ray remnant is now expanding at a much slower rate of v ∼ 1400 km s^-1 than it was until 2004 (v ∼ 6000 km s^-1). ",0,0
"The variation of the expansion rate of the Universe with time produces an evolution in the cosmological redshift of distant sources (for example quasar Lyman-α absorption lines), that might be directly observed by future ultra stable, high-resolution spectrographs (such as CODEX) coupled to extremely large telescopes (such as European Southern Observatory's Extremely Large Telescope, ELT). This would open a new window to explore the physical mechanism responsible for the current acceleration of the Universe. We investigate the evolution of cosmological redshift from a variety of dark energy models, and compare it with simulated data. We perform a Fisher matrix analysis and discuss the prospects for constraining the parameters of these models and for discriminating among competing candidates. We find that, because of parameter degeneracies, and of the inherent technical difficulties involved in this kind of observations, the uncertainties on parameter reconstruction can be rather large unless strong external priors are assumed. However, the method could be a valuable complementary cosmological tool, and give important insights on the dynamics of dark energy, not obtainable using other probes. ",0,0
"We present the results from an optical spectroscopic analysis of the massive stars HD 37366 and HD 54662. We find that HD 37366 is a double-lined spectroscopic binary with a period of 31.8187 +/- 0.0004 days, and HD 54662 is also a double lined binary with a much longer period of 557.8 +/- 0.3 days. The primary of HD 37366 is classified as O9.5 V, and it contributes approximately two-thirds of the optical flux. The less luminous secondary is a broad-lined, early B-type main-sequence star. Tomographic reconstruction of the individual spectra of HD 37366 reveals absorption lines present in each component, enabling us to constrain the nature of the secondary and physical characteristics of both stars. Tomographic reconstruction was not possible for HD 54662; however, we do present mean spectra from our observations that show that the secondary component is approximately half as bright as the primary. The observed spectral energy distributions (SEDs) were fit with model SEDs and galactic reddening curves to determine the angular sizes of the stars. By assuming radii appropriate for their classifications, we determine distance ranges of 1.4 - 1.9 and 1.2 - 1.5 kpc for HD 37366 and HD 54662, respectively. ",0,0
"We obtain constraints on possible structures of mass matrices in the quark sector by using as experimental restrictions the determined values of the quark masses at the M_Z energy scale, the magnitudes of the quark mixing matrix elements V_ ud, V_ us, V_ cd, and V_ cs, and the Jarlskog invariant J(V). Different cases of specific mass matrices are examined in detail. The quality of the fits for the Fritzsch and Stech type mass matrices is about the same with χ^2/ dof=4.23/3=1.41 and χ^2/ dof=9.10/4=2.28, respectively. The fit for a simple generalization (one extra parameter) of the Fritzsch type matrices, in the physical basis, is much better with χ^2/ dof=1.89/4=0.47. For comparison we also include the results using the quark masses at the 2 GeV energy scale. The fits obtained at this energy scale are similar to that at M_Z energy scale, implying that our results are unaffected by the evolution of the quark masses from 2 to 91 GeV. ",0,0
"Human beings like to believe they are in control of their destiny. This ubiquitous trait seems to increase motivation and persistence, and is probably evolutionarily adaptive. But how good really is our ability to control? How successful is our track record in these areas? There is little understanding of when and under what circumstances we may over-estimate or even lose our ability to control and optimize outcomes, especially when they are the result of aggregations of individual optimization processes. Here, we demonstrate analytically using the theory of Markov Chains and by numerical simulations in two classes of games, the Minority game and the Parrondo Games, that agents who optimize their strategy based on past information actually perform worse than non-optimizing agents. In other words, low-entropy (more informative) strategies under-perform high-entropy (or random) strategies. This provides a precise definition of the 'illusion of control' in set-ups a priori defined to emphasize the importance of optimization. ",0,0
"Consider a N× n random matrix Y_n=(Y_ij^n) where the entries are given byY_ij^n=σ_ij(n)/√(n) X_ij^n the X_ij^n being centered, independent and identically distributed random variables with unit variance and (σ_ij(n); 1≤ i≤ N, 1≤ j≤ n) being an array of numbers we shall refer to as a variance profile. We study in this article the fluctuations of the random variablelog(Y_n Y_n^* + ρ I_N) where Y^* is the Hermitian adjoint of Y and ρ > 0 is an additional parameter. We prove that when centered and properly rescaled, this random variable satisfies a Central Limit Theorem (CLT) and has a Gaussian limit whose parameters are identified. A complete description of the scaling parameter is given; in particular it is shown that an additional term appears in this parameter in the case where the 4^th moment of the X_ij's differs from the 4^th moment of a Gaussian random variable. Such a CLT is of interest in the field of wireless communications. ",0,0
"We present a numerical method for spatially 1.5-dimensional and time-dependent studies of accretion disks around black holes, that is originated from a combination of the standard pseudo-spectral method and the adaptive domain decomposition method existing in the literature, but with a number of improvements in both the numerical and physical senses. In particular, we introduce a new treatment for the connection at the interfaces of decomposed subdomains, construct an adaptive function for the mapping between the Chebyshev-Gauss-Lobatto collocation points and the physical collocation points in each subdomain, and modify the over-simplified 1-dimensional basic equations of accretion flows to account for the effects of viscous stresses in both the azimuthal and radial directions. Our method is verified by reproducing the best results obtained previously by SzuszkiewiczMiller on the limit-cycle behavior of thermally unstable accretion disks with moderate viscosity. A new finding is that, according to our computations, the Bernoulli function of the matter in such disks is always and everywhere negative, so that outflows are unlikely to originate from these disks. We are encouraged to study the more difficult case of thermally unstable accretion disks with strong viscosity, and wish to report our results in a subsequent paper. ",0,0
"We present a study of rotation (vsini) and chromospheric activity (Halpha EW) based on an extensive set of high-resolution optical spectra obtained with MIKE on the 6.5m Magellan Clay telescope. Our targets are 74 F-M dwarfs in the young stellar associations Eta Cha, TW Hydrae, Beta Pic, and Tuc-Hor, spanning ages from 6 to 30 Myr. While the Halpha EW for most F and G stars are consistent with pure photospheric absorption, most K and M stars show chromospheric emission. By comparing Halpha EW in our sample to results in the literature, we see a clear evolutionary sequence: Chromospheric activity declines steadily from the T Tauri phase to the main sequence. Using activity as an age indicator, we find a plausible age range for the Tuc-Hor association of 10-40 Myr. Between 5 and 30 Myr, we do not see evidence for rotational braking in the total sample, thus angular momentum is conserved, in contrast to younger stars. This difference indicates a change in the rotational regulation at 5-10 Myr, possibly because disk braking cannot operate longer than typical disk lifetimes, allowing the objects to spin up. The rotation-activity relation is flat in our sample; in contrast to main-sequence stars, there is no linear correlation for slow rotators. We argue that this is because young stars generate their magnetic fields in a fundamentally different way from main-sequence stars, and not just the result of a saturated solar-type dynamo. By comparing our rotational velocities with published rotation periods for a subset of stars, we determine ages of 13 (7-20) Myr and 9 (7-17 Myr for the Eta Cha and TWA associations, respectively, consistent with previous estimates. Thus we conclude that stellar radii from evolutionary models by Baraffe et al. (1998) are in agreement with the observed radii within +-15",0,0
"After the work of Gladman et al. (1998), it is now assessed that many irregular satellites are orbiting around Uranus. Despite many studies have been performed in past years, very few is know for the light-curves of these objects and inconsistencies are present between colours derived by different authors. This situation motivated our effort to improve both the knowledge of colours and light curves. We present and discuss time series observations of Sycorax, Prospero, Stephano, Setebos and Trinculo, five faint irregular satellites of Uranus, carried out at VLT, ESO Paranal (Chile) in the nights between 29 and 30 July, 2005 and 25 and 30 November, 2005. We derive light curves for Sycorax and Prospero and colours for all of these these bodies. For Sycorax we obtain colours B-V =0.839 +/- 0.014, V-R = 0.531 +/- 0.005 and a light curve which is suggestive of a periodical variation with period about 3.6 hours and amplitude about 0.067 +/- 0.004 mag. The periods and colours we derive for Sycorax are in agreement with our previous determination in 1999 using NTT. We derive also a light-curve for Prospero which suggests an amplitude of about 0.2 mag and a periodicity of about 4 hours. However, the sparseness of our data, prevents a more precise characterization of the light-curves, and we can not determine wether they are one-peaked or two-peaked. Hence, these periods and amplitudes have to be considered preliminary estimates. As for Setebos, Stephano and Trinculo the present data do not allow to derive any unambiguous periodicity, despite Setebos displays a significant variability with amplitude about as large as that of Prospero. Colours for Prospero, Setebos, Stephano and Trinculo are in marginal agreement with the literature. ",0,0
"The evolution of multicellular organisms from monocellular ancestors represents one of the greatest advances of the history of life. The assembly of such multicellular organisms requires signalling and response between cells: over millions of years these signalling processes have become extremely sophisticated and refined by evolution, such that study of modern organisms may not be able to shed much light on the original ancient processes . Here we are interested in determining how simple a signalling method can be, while still achieving self-assembly. In 2D a coupled cellular automaton/differential equation approach models organisms and chemotaxic chemicals, producing spiralling aggregation. In 3D Lennard-Jones-like particles are used to represent single cells, and their evolution in response to signalling is followed by molecular dynamics. It is found that if a single cell is able to emit a signal which induces others to move towards it, then a colony of single-cell organisms can assemble into shapes as complex as a tower, a ball atop a stalk, or a fast-moving slug. The similarity with the behaviour of modern Dictyostelium slime molds signalling with cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is striking. ",0,0

"Having already reported on the first photometric study of the intermediate-age open cluster NGC 1883 (Carraro et al. 2003), we present in this paper the first spectroscopic multi-epoch investigation of a sample of evolved stars in the same cluster. The aim is to derive the cluster membership, velocity and metallicity, and discuss recent claims in the literature (Tadross 2005) that NGC 1883 is as metal poor as globular clusters in the Halo. Besides, being one of the few outer Galactic disk intermediate-age open clusters known so far, it is an ideal target to improve our knowledge of the Galactic disk radial abundance gradient, that is a basic ingredient for any chemical evolution model of the Milky Way. The new data we obtained allow us to put NGC 1883's basic parameters more reliable. We find that the cluster has a mean metallicity of [Fe/H] = -0.20±0.22, from which we infer an age (650^+70_-70 Myr) close to the Hyades one and a Galactocentric distance of 12.3^+0.4_-0.2 kpc. The metal abundance, kinematics, and position make NGC 1883 a genuine outer disk intermediate-age open cluster. We confirm that in the outer Galactic disk the abundance gradient is shallower than in the solar vicinity. ",0,0
"Very recently, it has been shown that thermal noise and its artificial versions (Johnson-like noises) can be utilized as an information carrier with peculiar properties therefore it may be proper to call this topic Thermal Noise Informatics. Zero Power (Stealth) Communication, Thermal Noise Driven Computing, and Totally Secure Classical Communication are relevant examples. In this paper, while we will briefly describe the first and the second subjects, we shall focus on the third subject, the secure classical communication via wire. This way of secure telecommunication utilizes the properties of Johnson(-like) noise and those of a simple Kirchhoff's loop. The communicator is unconditionally secure at the conceptual (circuit theoretical) level and this property is (so far) unique in communication systems based on classical physics. The communicator is superior to quantum alternatives in all known aspects, except the need of using a wire. In the idealized system, the eavesdropper can extract zero bit of information without getting uncovered. The scheme is naturally protected against the man-in-the-middle attack. The communication can take place also via currently used power lines or phone (wire) lines and it is not only a point-to-point communication like quantum channels but network-ready. Tests have been carried out on a model-line with ranges beyond the ranges of any known direct quantum communication channel and they indicate unrivalled signal fidelity and security performance.

"We study macroscopic quantum tunneling (MQT) in c-axis twist Josephson junctions made of high-T_c superconductors in order to clarify the influence of the anisotropic order parameter symmetry (OPS) on MQT. The dependence of the MQT rate on the twist angle γ about the c-axis is calculated by using the functional integral and the bounce method. Due to the d-wave OPS, the γ dependence of standard deviation of the switching current distribution and the crossover temperature from thermal activation to MQT are found to be given by cos2γ and √(cos2γ), respectively. We also show that a dissipative effect resulting from the nodal quasiparticle excitation on MQT is negligibly small, which is consistent with recent MQT experiments using Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_8 + δ intrinsic junctions. These results indicate that MQT in c-axis twist junctions becomes a useful experimental tool for testing the OPS of high-T_c materials at low temperature, and suggest high potential of such junctions for qubit applications.

"The WMAP experiment has revealed an excess of microwave emission from the region around the center of our Galaxy. It has been suggested that this signal, known as the “WMAP Haze”, could be synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons and positrons generated in dark matter annihilations. In this letter, we revisit this possibility. We find that the angular distribution of the WMAP Haze matches the prediction for dark matter annihilations with a cusped density profile, ρ(r) ∝ r^-1.2 in the inner kiloparsecs. Comparing the intensity in different WMAP frequency bands, we find that a wide range of possible WIMP annihilation modes are consistent with the spectrum of the haze for a WIMP with a mass in the 100 GeV to multi-TeV range. Most interestingly, we find that to generate the observed intensity of the haze, the dark matter annihilation cross section is required to be approximately equal to the value needed for a thermal relic, σ v ∼ 3 × 10^-26 cm^3/s. No boost factors are required. If dark matter annihilations are in fact responsible for the WMAP Haze, and the slope of the halo profile continues into the inner Galaxy, GLAST is expected to detect gamma rays from the dark matter annihilations in the Galactic Center if the WIMP mass is less than several hundred GeV.

"Magnetic nanoparticles with Neel surface anisotropy, different internal structures, surface arrangements and elongation are modelled as many-spin systems. The results suggest that the energy of many-spin nanoparticles cut from cubic lattices can be represented by an effective one-spin potential containing uniaxial and cubic anisotropies. It is shown that the values and signs of the corresponding constants depend strongly on the particle's surface arrangement, internal structure and elongation. Particles cut from a simple cubic lattice have the opposite sign of the effective cubic term, as compared to particles cut from the face-centered cubic lattice. Furthermore, other remarkable phenomena are observed in nanoparticles with relatively strong surface effects: (i) In elongated particles surface effects can change the sign of the uniaxial anisotropy. (ii) In symmetric particles (spherical and truncated octahedral) with cubic core anisotropy surface effects can change its sign. We also show that the competition between the core and surface anisotropies leads to a new energy that contributes to both the 2nd- and 4th-order effective anisotropies. ",0,0
"We consider inapproximability of the correlation clustering problem defined as follows: Given a graph G = (V,E) where each edge is labeled either '+' (similar) or '-' (dissimilar), correlation clustering seeks to partition the vertices into clusters so that the number of pairs correctly (resp. incorrectly) classified with respect to the labels is maximized (resp. minimized). The two complementary problems are called MaxAgree and MinDisagree, respectively, and have been studied on complete graphs, where every edge is labeled, and general graphs, where some edge might not have been labeled. Natural edge-weighted versions of both problems have been studied as well. Let S-MaxAgree denote the weighted problem where all weights are taken from set S, we show that S-MaxAgree with weights bounded by O(|V|^1/2-δ) essentially belongs to the same hardness class in the following sense: if there is a polynomial time algorithm that approximates S-MaxAgree within a factor of λ = O(log|V|) with high probability, then for any choice of S', S'-MaxAgree can be approximated in polynomial time within a factor of (λ + ϵ), where ϵ > 0 can be arbitrarily small, with high probability. A similar statement also holds for S-MinDisagree. This result implies it is hard (assumingNP ≠RP) to approximate unweighted MaxAgree within a factor of80/79-ϵ, improving upon a previous known factor of116/115-ϵby Charikar et. al. <cit.>.",0,0

"Models which accelerate the expansion of the universe through the addition of a function of the Ricci scalar f(R) leave a characteristic signature in the large-scale structure of the universe at the Compton wavelength scale of the extra scalar degree of freedom. We search for such a signature in current cosmological data sets: the WMAP cosmic microwave background (CMB) power spectrum, SNLS supernovae distance measures, the SDSS luminous red galaxy power spectrum, and galaxy-CMB angular correlations. Due to theoretical uncertainties in the nonlinear evolution of f(R) models, the galaxy power spectrum conservatively yields only weak constraints on the models despite the strong predicted signature in the linear matter power spectrum. Currently the tightest constraints involve the modification to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect from growth of gravitational potentials during the acceleration epoch. This effect is manifest for large Compton wavelengths in enhanced low multipole power in the CMB and anti-correlation between the CMB and tracers of the potential. They place a bound on the Compton wavelength of the field be less than of order the Hubble scale. ",0,0
"Motivated by the Dobrushin uniqueness theorem in statistical mechanics, we consider the following situation: Let αbe a nonnegative matrix over a finite or countably infinite index set X, and define the 'cleaning operators' β_h = I_1-h + I_h αfor h: X →[0,1] (here I_f denotes the diagonal matrix with entries f). We ask: For which 'cleaning sequences' h_1, h_2, ... do we have c β_h_1 ... β_h_n →0 for a suitable class of 'dirt vectors' c? We show, under a modest condition on α, that this occurs whenever ∑_i h_i = ∞everywhere on X. More generally, we analyze the cleaning of subsets Λ⊆X and the final distribution of dirt on the complement of Λ. We show that when supp(h_i) ⊆Λwith ∑_i h_i = ∞everywhere on Λ, the operators β_h_1 ... β_h_n converge as n →∞to the 'balayage operator' Π_Λ= ∑_k=0^∞(I_Λα)^k I_Λ^c).

"We present a microscopic theory for superconductivity in a magnetic field based on a local approximation approach. We derive an expression for free energy density F as a function of temperature T and vector potential a, and two basic equations of the theory: the first is an implicit solution for energy gap parameter amplitude |Δ_ k| as a function of wave vector k, temperature T and vector potential a; and the second is a London-like relation between electrical current density j and vector potential a, with an “effective superconducting electron density” n_s that is both T- and a-dependent. The two equations allow determination of spatial variations of a and |Δ_ k| in a superconductor for given temperature T, applied magnetic field H_a and sample geometry. The theory shows the existence of a “partly-paired state,” in which paired electrons (having |Δ_ k|>0) and de-paired electrons (having |Δ_ k|=0) co-exist. Such a “partly-paired state” exists even at T=0 when H_a is above a threshold for a given sample, giving rise to a non-vanishing Knight shift at T=0 for H_a above the threshold. We expect the theory to be valid for highly-local superconductors for all temperatures and magnetic fields below the superconducting transition. In the low-field limit, the theory reduces to the local-limit result of BCS. As examples, we apply the theory to the case of a semi-infinite superconductor in an applied magnetic field H_a parallel to the surface of the superconductor and the case of an isolated vortex in an infinite superconductor, and determine, in each case, spatial variations of quantities such as a and |Δ_ k|.

"We obtained comprehensive sets of elemental abundances for eleven damped Ly-alpha systems (DLAs) at z_DLA=1.7-2.5. In Paper I of this series, we showed for three DLA galaxies that we can derive their star formation histories and ages from a detailed comparison of their intrinsic abundance patterns with chemical evolution models. We determine in this paper the star formation properties of six additional DLA galaxies. The derived results confirm that no single star formation history explains the diverse sets of abundance patterns in DLAs. We demonstrate that the various star formation histories reproducing the DLA abundance patterns are typical of local irregular, dwarf starburst and quiescent spiral galaxies. Independent of the star formation history, the DLAs have a common characteristic of being weak star forming galaxies; models with high star formation efficiencies are ruled out. All the derived DLA star formation rates per unit area are moderate or low, with values between -3.2 < log SFR < -1.1 M_sol yr^-1 kpc^-2. The DLA abundance patterns require a large spread in ages ranging from 20 Myr up to 3 Gyr. The oldest DLA in our sample is observed at z_DLA=1.864 with an age estimated to more than 3 Gyr; it nicely indicates that galaxies were already forming at z_f>10. But, most of the DLAs show ages much younger than that of the Universe at the epoch of observation. Young galaxies thus seem to populate the high redshift Universe at z>2, suggesting relatively low redshifts of formation (z 3) for most high-redshift galaxies. The DLA star formation properties are compared with those of other high-redshift galaxies identified in deep imaging surveys with the aim of obtaining a global picture of high-redshift objects. ",0,0
"Mobile entities with wireless links are able to form a mobile ad-hoc network. Such an infrastructureless network does not have to be administrated. However, self-organizing principles have to be applied to deal with upcoming problems, e.g. information dissemination. These kinds of problems are not easy to tackle, requiring complex algorithms. Moreover, the usefulness of pure ad-hoc networks is arguably limited. Hence, enthusiasm for mobile ad-hoc networks, which could eliminate the need for any fixed infrastructure, has been damped. The goal is to overcome the limitations of pure ad-hoc networks by augmenting them with instant Internet access, e.g. via integration of UMTS respectively GSM links. However, this raises multiple questions at the technical as well as the organizational level. Motivated by characteristics of small-world networks that describe an efficient network even without central or organized design, this paper proposes to combine mobile ad-hoc networks and infrastructured networks to form hybrid wireless networks. One main objective is to investigate how this approach can reduce the costs of a permanent backbone link and providing in the same way the benefits of useful information from Internet connectivity or service providers. For the purpose of bridging between the different types of networks, an adequate middleware service is the focus of our investigation. This paper shows our first steps forward to this middleware by introducing the Injection Communication paradigm as principal concept. ",0,0
"We study two continuous variable systems (or two harmonic oscillators) and investigate their entanglement evolution under the influence of non-Markovian thermal environments. The continuous variable systems could be two modes of electromagnetic fields or two nanomechanical oscillators in the quantum domain. We use quantum open system method to derive the non-Markovian master equations of the reduced density matrix for two different but related models of the continuous variable systems. The two models both consist of two interacting harmonic oscillators. In model A, each of the two oscillators is coupled to its own independent thermal reservoir, while in model B the two oscillators are coupled to a common reservoir. To quantify the degrees of entanglement for the bipartite continuous variable systems in Gaussian states, logarithmic negativity is used. We find that the dynamics of the quantum entanglement is sensitive to the initial states, the oscillator-oscillator interaction, the oscillator-environment interaction and the coupling to a common bath or to different, independent baths.

"We show that all static spacetimes in higher dimensions are of Weyl types G, I_i, D or O. This applies also to stationary spacetimes if additional conditions are fulfilled, as for most known black hole/ring solutions. (The conclusions change when the Killing generator becomes null, such as at Killing horizons.) Next we demonstrate that the same Weyl types characterize warped product spacetimes with a one-dimensional Lorentzian (timelike) factor, whereas warped spacetimes with a two-dimensional Lorentzian factor are restricted to the types D or O. By exploring the Bianchi identities, we then analyze the simplest non-trivial case from the above classes - type D vacuum spacetimes, possibly with a cosmological constant, dropping, however, the assumptions that the spacetime is static, stationary or warped. It is shown that for “generic” type D vacuum spacetimes the corresponding principal null directions are geodetic in any dimension (this applies also to type II spacetimes). For n>=5, however, there may exist particular cases of type D spacetimes which admit non-geodetic multiple principal null directions and we present such examples in any n>=7. Further studies are restricted to five dimensions, where the type D Weyl tensor is described by a 3x3 matrix Φ_ij. In the case with “twistfree” (A_ij=0) principal null geodesics we show that in a “generic” case Φ_ij is symmetric and eigenvectors of Φ_ij coincide with those of the expansion matrix S_ij, providing us with three preferred spacelike directions of the spacetime. Similar results are also obtained when relaxing the twistfree condition and assuming instead that Φ_ij is symmetric. The n=5 Myers-Perry black hole and Kerr-NUT-AdS metrics in arbitrary dimension are briefly studied as specific examples of type D vacuum spacetime. ",0,0
"The paper is devoted to homogenization of two-phase incompressible viscoelastic flows with disordered microstructure. We study two cases. In the first case, both phases are modeled as Kelvin-Voight viscoelastic materials. In the second case, one phase is a Kelvin-Voight material, and the other is a viscous Newtonian fluid. The microscale system contains the conservation of mass and balance of momentum equations. The inertial terms in the momentum equation incorporate the actual interface advected by the flow. In the constitutive equations, a frozen interface is employed. The interface geometry is arbitrary: we do not assume periodicity, statistical homogeneity or scale separation. The problem is homogenized using G-convergence and oscillating test functions. Since the microscale system is not parabolic, previously known constructions of the test functions do not work here. The test functions developed in the paper are non-local in time and satisfy divergence-free constraint exactly. The latter feature enables us to avoid working with pressure directly. We show that the effective medium is a single phase viscoelastic material that is not necessarily of Kelvin-Voight type. The effective constitutive equation contains a long memory viscoelastic term, as well as instantaneous elastic and viscous terms. ",0,0
"During the whole of 1874, Camille Jordan and Leopold Kronecker quar- relled vigorously over the organisation of the theory of bilinear forms. That theory promised a 'general' and 'homogeneous' treatment of numerous questions arising in various 19th-century theoretical contexts, and it hinged on two theorems, stated independently by Jordan and Weierstrass, that would today be considered equivalent. It was, however, the perceived difference between those two theorems that sparked the 1874 controversy. Focusing on this quarrel allows us to explore the algebraic identity of the polynomial practices of the manipulations of forms in use before the advent of structural approaches to linear algebra. The latter approaches identified these practices with methods for the classification of similar matrices. We show that the prac- tices – Jordan's canonical reduction and Kronecker's invariant computation – reflect identities inseparable from the social context of the time. Moreover, these practices reveal not only tacit knowledge, local ways of thinking, but also – in light of a long history tracing back to the work of Lagrange, Laplace, Cau- chy, and Hermite – two internal philosophies regarding the significance of generality which are inseparable from two disciplinary ideals opposing algebra and arithmetic. By interrogating the cultural identities of such practices, this study aims at a deeper understanding of the history of linear algebra without focusing on issues related to the origins of theories or structures.

"Determination of the cosmic infrared background (CIB) at far infrared wavelengths using COBE/DIRBE data is limited by the accuracy to which foreground interplanetary and Galactic dust emission can be modeled and subtracted. Previous determinations of the far infrared CIB (e.g., Hauser et al. 1998) were based on the detection of residual isotropic emission in skymaps from which the emission from interplanetary dust and the neutral interstellar medium were removed. In this paper we use the Wisconsin H-alpha Mapper (WHAM) Northern Sky Survey as a tracer of the ionized medium to examine the effect of this foreground component on determination of the CIB. We decompose the DIRBE far infrared data for five high Galactic latitude regions into H I and H-alpha correlated components and a residual component. We find the H-alpha correlated component to be consistent with zero for each region, and we find that addition of an H-alpha correlated component in modeling the foreground emission has negligible effect on derived CIB results. Our CIB detections and 2 sigma upper limits are essentially the same as those derived by Hauser et al. and are given by nu I_nu (nW m-2 sr-1) < 75, < 32, 25 +- 8, and 13 +- 3 at 60, 100, 140, and 240 microns, respectively. Our residuals have not been subjected to a detailed anisotropy test, so our CIB results do not supersede those of Hauser et al. We derive upper limits on the 100 micron emissivity of the ionized medium that are typically about 40",0,0
"We present new results on dynamical instabilities in rapidly rotating neutron-stars. In particular, using numerical simulations in full General Relativity, we analyse the effects that the stellar compactness has on the threshold for the onset of the dynamical bar-mode instability, as well as on the appearance of other dynamical instabilities. By using an extrapolation technique developed and tested in our previous study [1], we explicitly determine the threshold for a wide range of compactnesses using four sequences of models of constant baryonic mass comprising a total of 59 stellar models. Our calculation of the threshold is in good agreement with the Newtonian prediction and improves the previous post-Newtonian estimates. In addition, we find that for stars with sufficiently large mass and compactness, the m=3 deformation is the fastest growing one. For all of the models considered, the non-axisymmetric instability is suppressed on a dynamical timescale with an m=1 deformation dominating the final stages of the instability. These results, together with those presented in [1], suggest that an m=1 deformation represents a general and late-time feature of non-axisymmetric dynamical instabilities both in full General Relativity and in Newtonian gravity.

"The effect of the electron density stratification on the intensity profiles of the H I Ly-α line and the O VI and Mg X doublets formed in solar coronal holes is investigated. We employ an analytical 2-D model of the large scale coronal magnetic field that provides a good representation of the corona at the minimum of solar activity. We use the mass-flux conservation equation to determine the outflow speed of the solar wind at any location in the solar corona and take into account the integration along the line of sight (LOS). The main assumption we make is that no anisotropy in the kinetic temperature of the coronal species is considered. We find that at distances greater than 1 Rsun from the solar surface the widths of the emitted lines of O VI and Mg X are sensitive to the details of the adopted electron density stratification. However, Ly-α, which is a pure radiative line, is hardly affected. The calculated total intensities of Ly-α and the O VI doublet depend to a lesser degree on the density stratification and are comparable to the observed ones for most of the considered density models. The widths of the observed profiles of Ly-α and Mg X are well reproduced by most of the considered electron density stratifications, while for the O VI doublet only few stratifications give satisfying results. The densities deduced from SOHO data result in O VI profiles whose widths and intensity ratio are relatively close to the values observed by UVCS although only isotropic velocity distributions are employed. These density profiles also reproduce the other considered observables with good accuracy. Thus the need for a strong anisotropy of the velocity distribution (i.e. a temperature anisotropy) is not so clear cut as previous investigations of UVCS data suggested. ... ",0,0
"Order(N) Tight-Binding Molecular Dynamics (TBMD) simulations are performed to investigate the thermal stability of (10,10) metallic Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes (SWCNT). Periodic boundary conditions (PBC) are applied in axial direction. Velocity Verlet algorithm along with the canonical ensemble molecular dynamics (NVT) is used to simulate the tubes at the targeted temperatures. The effects of slow and rapid temperature increases on the physical characteristics, structural stability and the energetics of the tube are investigated and compared. Simulations are carried out starting from room temperature and the temperature is raised in steps of 300K. Stability of the simulated metallic SWCNT is examined at each step before it is heated to higher temperatures. First indication of structural deformation is observed at 600K. For higher heat treatments the deformations are more pronounced and the bond breaking temperature is reached around 2500K. Gradual (slow) heating and thermal equilibrium (fast heating) methods give the value of radial thermal expansion coefficient in the temperature range between 300K-600K as 0.31x10^-5(1/K) and 0.089x10^-5(1/K), respectively. After 600K, both methods give the same value of 0.089x10^-5(1/K). The ratio of the total energy per atom with respect to temperature is found to be 3x10^-4 eV/K. ",0,0
"The structural environment of substitutional Cr3+ ion in MgAl2O4 spinel has been investigated by Cr K-edge Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) and X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) spectroscopies. First-principles computations of the structural relaxation and of the XANES spectrum have been performed, with a good agreement to the experiment. The Cr-O distance is close to that in MgCr2O4, indicating a full relaxation of the first neighbors, and the second shell of Al atoms relaxes partially. These observations demonstrate that Vegard's law is not obeyed in the MgAl2O4-MgCr2O4 solid solution. Despite some angular site distortion, the local D3d symmetry of the B-site of the spinel structure is retained during the substitution of Cr for Al. Here, we show that the relaxation is accomodated by strain-induced bond buckling, with angular tilts of the Mg-centred tetrahedra around the Cr-centred octahedron. By contrast, there is no significant alteration of the angles between the edge-sharing octahedra, which build chains aligned along the three four-fold axes of the cubic structure. ",0,0
"The apparent contradiction between the recently observed weak charge disproportion and the traditional Mn^3+/Mn^4+ picture of the charge-orbital orders in half-doped manganites is resolved by a novel Wannier states analysis of the LDA+U electronic structure. Strong electron itinerancy in this charge-transfer system significantly delocalizes the occupied low-energy 'Mn^3+' Wannier states such that charge leaks into the 'Mn^4+'-sites. Furthermore, the leading mechanisms of the charge order are quantified via our first-principles derivation of the low-energy effective Hamiltonian. The electron-electron interaction is found to play a role as important as the electron-lattice interaction. A general picture of doped holes in strongly correlated charge-transfer systems is presented and applied to the study of charge order in half-doped manganites, using a novel Wannier states analysis of the LDA+U electronic structure. While residing primarily in the oxygen atoms, the doped holes form additional effective e_g orbitals at the low-energy scale, leading to an effective Mn^3+/Mn^4+ valence picture that enables weak charge disproportion, resolving the current serious contradictions between the recent experimental observations of charge distribution and traditional models. Furthermore, the leading mechanisms of the observed charge order are quantified via our first-principles derivation of the low-energy effective Hamiltonian ",0,0
"Typical astronomical spectrographs have a resolution ranging between a few hundred to 200.000. Deconvolution and correlation techniques are being employed with a significance down to 1/1000 th of a pixel. HeAr and ThAr lamps are usually used for calibration in low and high resolution spectroscopy, respectively. Unfortunately, the emitted lines typically cover only a small fraction of the spectrometer's spectral range. Furthermore, their exact position depends strongly on environmental conditions. A problem is the strong intensity variation between different (intensity ratios >300). In addition, the brightness of the lamps is insufficient to illuminate a spectrograph via an integrating sphere, which in turn is important to calibrate a long-slit spectrograph, as this is the only way to assure a uniform illumination of the spectrograph pupil.Laboratory precision laser spectroscopy has experienced a major advance with the development of optical frequency combs generated by pulsed femto-second lasers. These lasers emit a broad spectrum (several hundred nanometers in the visible and near infra-red) of equally-spaced 'comb' lines with almost uniform intensity (intensity ratios typically <10). Self-referencing of the laser establishes a precise ruler in frequency space that can be stabilized to the 10e-18 uncertainty level, reaching absolute frequency inaccuracies at the 10e-12 level per day when using the Global Positioning System's (GPS) time signal as the reference. The exploration of the merits of this new technology holds the promise for broad-band, highly accurate and reproducible calibration required for reliable operation of current and next generation astronomic spectrometers.

"This is the second of two papers reporting observations and analysis of the unusually bright (m_b=14.4), luminous (M_B=-25.5), nearby (z=0.192) narrow-line quasar PHL 1811. The first paper reported that PHL 1811 is intrinsically X-ray weak, and presented a spectral energy distribution (SED). Here we present HST STIS optical and UV spectra, and ground-based optical spectra. The optical and UV line emission is very unusual. There is no evidence for forbidden or semiforbidden lines. The near-UV spectrum is dominated by very strong FeII and FeIII, and unusual low-ionization lines such as NaID and CaII HK are observed. High-ionization lines are very weak; CIV has an equivalent width of 6.6A, a factor of5 smaller than measured from quasar composite spectra. An unusual feature near 1200A can be deblended in terms of Lyα, NV, SiII, and CIII* using the blueshifted CIV profile as a template. Photoionization modeling shows that the unusual line emission can be explained qualitatively by the unusually soft SED. Principally, a low gas temperature results in inefficient emission of collisionally excited lines, including the semiforbidden lines generally used as density diagnostics. The emission resembles that of high-density gas; in both cases this is a consequence of inefficient cooling. PHL 1811 is very unusual, but we note that quasar surveys are generally biased against finding similar objects. ",0,0

Their regularity properties, including BMO regularity and their extension to the complex plane, have been thoroughly investigated.

We then consider the case α=0, u(x)=-log(x) and we prove that x is a Brjuno number (for α> 0) if and only if both x and -x are Brjuno numbers for α=0. ",0,0
"We present the results of high precision measurements of the thermal expansion of the sintered SiC, SiC-100, intended for use in cryogenic space-telescopes, in which minimization of thermal deformation of the mirror is critical and precise information of the thermal expansion is needed for the telescope design. The temperature range of the measurements extends from room temperature down to ∼ 10 K. Three samples, #1, #2, and #3 were manufactured from blocks of SiC produced in different lots. The thermal expansion of the samples was measured with a cryogenic dilatometer, consisting of a laser interferometer, a cryostat, and a mechanical cooler. The typical thermal expansion curve is presented using the 8th order polynomial of the temperature. For the three samples, the coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE), α̅_#1, α̅_#2, and α̅_#3 were derived for temperatures between 293 K and 10 K. The average and the dispersion (1 σ rms) of these three CTEs are 0.816 and 0.002 (× 10^-6/K), respectively. No significant difference was detected in the CTE of the three samples from the different lots. Neither inhomogeneity nor anisotropy of the CTE was observed. Based on the obtained CTE dispersion, we performed an finite-element-method (FEM) analysis of the thermal deformation of a 3.5 m diameter cryogenic mirror made of six SiC-100 segments. It was shown that the present CTE measurement has a sufficient accuracy well enough for the design of the 3.5 m cryogenic infrared telescope mission, the Space Infrared telescope for Cosmology and Astrophysics (SPICA).

"Anomalous X-ray Pulsars (AXPs) belong to a class of neutron stars believed to harbor the strongest magnetic fields in the universe, as indicated by their energetic bursts and their rapid spindowns. However, an unambiguous measurement of their surface field strengths has not been made to date. It is also not known whether AXP outbursts result from changes in the neutron star magnetic field or crust properties. Here we report a spectroscopic measurement of the surface magnetic field strength of an AXP, XTE J1810-197, and solidify its magnetar nature. The field strength obtained from detailed spectral analysis and modeling, B = (2.72±0.03)×10^14 G, is remarkably close to the value inferred from the rate of spindown of this source and remains nearly constant during numerous observations spanning over an order of magnitude in source flux. The surface temperature, on the other hand, declines steadily and dramatically following the 2003 outburst of this source. Our findings demonstrate that heating occurs in the upper neutron star crust during an outburst and sheds light on the transient behaviour of AXPs. ",0,0
"Magnetic resonance imaging at ultra-low fields (ULF MRI) is a promising new imaging method that uses SQUID sensors to measure the spatially encoded precession of pre-polarized nuclear spin populations at a microtesla-range measurement field.

It is also equipped with five sets of coils for 3D Fourier imaging with pre-polarization. Essential technical details of the design are discussed.

"A series of semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering measurements on deuterium, helium, neon, krypton, and xenon targets has been performed in order to study hadronization. The data were collected with the HERMES detector at the DESY laboratory using a 27.6 GeV positron or electron beam. Hadron multiplicities on nucleus A relative to those on the deuteron, R_A^h, are presented for various hadrons (π^+, π^-, π^0, K^+, K^-, p, and p̅) as a function of the virtual-photon energy ν, the fraction z of this energy transferred to the hadron, the photon virtuality Q^2, and the hadron transverse momentum squared p_t^2. The data reveal a systematic decrease of R_A^h with the mass number A for each hadron type h. Furthermore, R_A^h increases (decreases) with increasing values of ν(z), increases slightly with increasing Q^2, and is almost independent of p_t^2, except at large values of p_t^2. For pions two-dimensional distributions also are presented. These indicate that the dependences of R_A^π on νand z can largely be described as a dependence on a single variable L_c, which is a combination of νand z. The dependence on L_c suggests in which kinematic conditions partonic and hadronic mechanisms may be dominant. The behaviour of R_A^π at large p_t^2 constitutes tentative evidence for a partonic energy-loss mechanism. The A-dependence of R_A^h is investigated as a function of ν, z, and of L_c. It approximately follows an A^α form with α≈0.5 - 0.6. ",0,0

As an application of this criteria we find a sufficient condition for a translation invariant factor state on a one dimensional quantum spin chain to be pure.

"We report the discovery of a new white dwarf/M dwarf binary, HS1857+5144, identified in the Hamburg Quasar Survey (HQS). Time-resolved optical spectroscopy and photometry were carried out to determine the properties of this new cataclysmic variable progenitor pre-CV). The light curves of HS1857+5144 display a sinusoidal variation with a period of Porb=383.52 min and peak-to-peak amplitudes of 0.7 mag and 1.1 mag in the B-band and R-band, respectively. The large amplitude of the brightness variation results from a reflection effect on the heated inner hemisphere of the companion star, suggesting a very high temperature of the white dwarf. Our radial velocity study confirms the photometric period as the orbital period of the system. A model atmosphere fit to the spectrum of the white dwarf obtained at minimum light provides limits to its mass and temperature of Mwd= 0.6-1.0 Msun and Twd= 70000-100000 K, respectively. The detection of HeII 4686 absorption classifies the primary star of HS1857+5144 as a DAO white dwarf.

We classify HS1857+5144 as one of the youngest pre-CV known to date. The cooling age of the white dwarf suggests that the present system has just emerged from a common envelope phase10^5 yr ago.

"An introductory review on the critical behaviour of some irreversible reaction systems is given. The study of these systems has attracted great attention during the last decades due to, on the one hand, the rich and complex underlying physics, and on the other hand, their relevance for numerous technological applications in heterogeneous catalysis, corrosion and coating, development of microelectronic devices, etc. The review is focuses on recent advances in the understanding of irreversible phase transitions (IPT's) providing a survey of the theoretical development of the field during the last decade, as well as a detailed discussion of relevant numerical simulations. The Langevin formulation for the treatment of second-order IPT's is discussed. Different Monte Carlo approaches are also presented in detail and the finite-size scaling analysis of second-order IPT's is described.

"The paper is considering an opportunity for the CERN/GranSasso (CNGS) neutrino complex, concurrent time-wise with T2K and NOvA, to search for theta_13 oscillations and CP violation. Compared with large water Cherenkov (T2K) and fine grained scintillators (NOvA), the LAr-TPC offers a higher detection efficiency and a lower backgrounds, since virtually all channels may be unambiguously recognized. The present proposal, called MODULAr, describes a 20 kt fiducial volume LAr-TPC, following very closely the technology developed for the ICARUS-T60o, and is focused on the following activities, for which we seek an extended international collaboration:(1) the neutrino beam from the CERN 400 GeV proton beam and an optimised horn focussing, eventually with an increased intensity in the framework of the LHC accelerator improvement program;(2) A new experimental area LNGS-B, of at least 50000 m3 at 10 km off-axis from the main Laboratory, eventually upgradable to larger sizes. A location is under consideration at about 1.2 km equivalent water depth;(3) A new LAr Imaging detector of at least 20 kt fiducial mass. Such an increase in the volume over the current ICARUS T600 needs to be carefully considered.

Further phases may foresee extensions of MODULAr to meet future physics goals.The experiment might reasonably be operational in about 4/5 years, provided a new hall is excavated in the vicinity of the Gran Sasso Laboratory and adequate funding and participation are made available.

"One of the most important tasks in high energy physics is search for the exotic states, such as glueball, hybrid and multi-quark states. The transitions ψ(ns)→ψ(ms)+ππ and Υ(ns)→Υ(ms)+ππ attract great attentions because they may reveal characteristics of hybrids. In this work, we analyze those transition modes in terms of the theoretical framework established by Yan and Kuang. It is interesting to notice that the intermediate states between the two gluon-emissions are hybrids, therefore by fitting the data, we are able to determine the mass spectra of hybrids. The ground hybrid states are predicted as 4.23 GeV (for charmonium) and 10.79 GeV (for bottonium) which do not correspond to any states measured in recent experiments, thus it may imply that very possibly, hybrids mix with regular quarkonia to constitute physical states. Comprehensive comparisons of the potentials for hybrids whose parameters are obtained in this scenario with the lattice results are presented. ",0,0
"The existence of a clumpy, large-scale filamentary structure is at the basis of the current paradigm of cosmic formation and evolution of clusters. The star-formation history of galaxies falling into a cluster is altered as a result of the environmental stresses. We investigate the relation between substructure and properties of the galaxy population in a 30'x30' region centered on the massive merging cluster A2744 at z 0.3. Multi-object spectroscopy at low resolution and BVR photometry are used to detect the presence of substructure through a Dressler-Schectman analysis and the photometric redshift technique, respectively. Galaxies at the same photometric redshift of the cluster are divided into red and blue according to their distribution in the B-R vs. R colour-magnitude diagram. We identify two large-scale filaments associated with A2744. Along these filaments, the blue-to-red galaxy number ratio increases together with the cluster-centric distance but peaks slightly beyond the cluster virial radius. The filaments host a population of bright, large (i.e. more luminous than R* for the main body of the cluster and with angular sizes of 13-22 h_70^-1 kpc) blue galaxies that is hardly found among galaxies lying in a neighbouring low-density environment at the same redshift of the cluster.

"We consider the accretion process in a disk with magnetic fields that are dragged in from the interstellar medium by gravitational collapse. Two diffusive processes are at work in the system: (1) 'viscous' torques exerted by turbulent and magnetic stresses, and (2) 'resistive' redistribution of mass with respect to the magnetic flux arising from the imperfect conduction of current. In steady state, self-consistency between the two rates of drift requires that a relationship exists between the coefficients of turbulent viscosity and turbulent resistivity. Ignoring any interactions with a stellar magnetosphere, we solve the steady-state equations for a magnetized disk under the gravitational attraction of a mass point and threaded by an amount of magnetic flux consistent with calculations of magnetized gravitational collapse in star formation. Our model mean-field equations have an exact analytical solution that corresponds to magnetically diluted Keplerian rotation about the central mass point. The solution yields the strength of the magnetic field and the surface density as functions of radial position in the disk and their connection with the departure from pure Keplerian rotation in representative cases. We compare the predictions of the theory with the available observations concerning T Tauri stars, FU Orionis stars, and low- and high-mass protostars. Finally, we speculate on the physical causes for high and low states of the accretion disks that surround young stellar objects. One of the more important results of this study is the physical derivation of analytic expressions for the turbulent viscosity and turbulent resistivity. ",0,0
"The measurement of the scale of the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the galaxy power spectrum as a function of redshift is a promising method to constrain the equation-of-state parameter of the dark energy w. To measure the scale of the BAO precisely, a substantial volume of space must be surveyed. We test whether light-cone effects are important and whether the scaling relations used to compensate for an incorrect reference cosmology are in this case sufficiently accurate. We investigate the degeneracies in the cosmological parameters and the benefits of using the two-dimensional anisotropic power spectrum. Finally, we estimate the uncertainty with which w can be measured by proposed surveys at redshifts of about z=3 and z=1, respectively.In the simulated survey we find that light-cone effects are small and that the simple scaling relations used to correct for the cosmological distortion work fairly well even for large survey volumes. The analysis of the two-dimensional anisotropic power spectra enables an independent determination to be made of the apparent scale of the BAO, perpendicular and parallel to the line of sight. This is essential for two-parameter w-models, such as the redshift-dependent dark energy model w=w_0+(1-a)w_a. Using Planck priors for the matter and baryon density and Delta(H_0)=5",0,0

"We study the two-photon process for the transitions ns –> 1s and nd –> 1s in hydrogen up to large n. For n<=20 we provide simple analytic fitting formulae to describe the non-resonant part of the two-photon emission profiles. Combining these with the analytic form of the cascade-term yields a simple and accurate description of the full two-photon decay spectrum, which only involves a sum over a few intermediate states. We demonstrate that the cascade term naturally leads to a nearly Lorentzian shape of the two-photon profiles in the vicinity of the resonances. However, due to quantum-electrodynamical corrections, the two-photon emission spectra deviate significantly from the Lorentzian shape in the very distant wings of the resonances. We investigate up to which distance the two-photon profiles are close to a Lorentzian and discuss the role of the interference term. We then analyze how the deviation of the two-photon profiles from the Lorentzian shape affects the dynamics of cosmological hydrogen recombination. Since in this context the escape of photons from the Lyman-alpha resonance plays a crucial role, we concentrate on the two-photon corrections in the vicinity of the Lyman-alpha line. Our computations show that the changes in the ionization history due to the additional two-photon process from high shell (n>2) likely do not reach the percent-level. For conservative assumptions we find a correction DN_e/N_e -0.4",0,0
"Background and Purpose: Percutaneous renal access in the context of percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is a difficult technique, requiring rapid and precise access to a particular calix. We present a computerized system designed to improve percutaneous renal access by projecting the ultrasound puncture tract onto fluoroscopic images. Materials and Methods: The system consists of a computer and a localizer allowing spatial localization of the position of the various instruments. Without any human intervention, the ultrasound nephrostomy tract is superimposed in real time onto fluoroscopic images acquired in various views. Results: We tested our approach by laboratory experiments on a phantom. Also, after approval by our institution's Ethics Committee, we validated this technique in the operating room during PCNL in one patient. Conclusion: Our system is reliable, and the absence of image-processing procedures makes it robust. We have initiated a prospective study to validate this technique both for PCNL specialists and as a learning tool. ",0,0
"The purpose of the present work is to treat a new notion related to linear dynamics, which can be viewed as a 'localization' of the notion of hypercyclicity. In particular, let T be a bounded linear operator acting on a Banach space X and let x be a non-zero vector in X such that for every open neighborhood U⊂ X of x and every non-empty open set V⊂ X there exists a positive integer n such that T^nU∩ V≠∅. In this case T will be called a J-class operator. We investigate the class of operators satisfying the above property and provide various examples. It is worthwhile to mention that many results from the theory of hypercyclic operators have their analogues in this setting. For example we establish results related to the Bourdon-Feldman theorem and we characterize the J-class weighted shifts. We would also like to stress that even non-separable Banach spaces which do not support topologically transitive operators, as for example l^∞(ℕ), do admit J-class operators. ",0,0
"When modeling the distribution of a set of data by a mixture of Gaussians, there are two possibilities: i) the classical one is using a set of parameters which are the proportions, the means and the variances; ii) the second is to consider the proportions as the probabilities of a discrete valued hidden variable. In the first case a usual prior distribution for the proportions is the Dirichlet which accounts for the fact that they have to sum up to one. In the second case, to each data is associated a hidden variable for which we consider two possibilities: a) assuming those variables to be i.i.d. We show then that this scheme is equivalent to the classical mixture model with Dirichlet prior; b) assuming a Markovian structure. Then we choose the simplest markovian model which is the Potts distribution. As we will see this model is more appropriate for the case where the data represents the pixels of an image for which the hidden variables represent a segmentation of that image. The main object of this paper is to give some details on these models and different algorithms used for their simulation and the estimation of their parameters.Key Words: Mixture of Gaussians, Dirichlet, Potts, Classification, Segmentation.

"As part of preparations for a southern sky search for faint Milky Way dwarf galaxy satellites, we report the discovery of a stellar overdensity in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 5, lying at an angular distance of only 1.5 degrees from the recently discovered Boötes dwarf. The overdensity was detected well above statistical noise by employing a sophisticated data mining algorithm and does not correspond to any catalogued object. Overlaid isochrones using stellar population synthesis models show that the color-magnitude diagram of that region has the signature of an old (12 Gyr), metal-poor (Fe/H≈-2.0) stellar population at a tentative distance of 60 kpc, evidently the same heliocentric distance as the Boötes dwarf. We estimate the new object to have a total magnitude of M_V∼-3.1±1.1 mag and a half-light radius of r_h=4'.1±1'.6 (72±28 pc) placing it in an apparent 40<r_h<100 pc void between globular clusters and dwarf galaxies, occupied only by another recently discovered Milky Way Satellite, Coma Berenices.

"This paper considers a 'striking outwards' reed coupled to a resonator. This expression, due to Helmholtz, is not discussed here : it corresponds to the most common model of a lip-type valve, when the valve is assumed to be a one degree of freedom oscillator. The presented work is an extension of the works done by Wilson and Beavers (1974), Tarnopolsky (2000). The range of the playing frequencies is investigated. The first results are analytical : when no losses are present in the resonator, it is proven that the ratio between the threshold frequency and the reed resonance frequency is found to be necessarily within the interval between unity and the square root of 3. This is a musical sixth. Actually the interval is largely smaller, and this is in accordance with e.g. the results by Cullen et al.. The smallest blowing pressure is found to be directly related to the quality factor of the reed. Numerical results confirm these statements, and are discussed in comparison with previous ones by Cullen et al (2000). ",0,0
"We present CaII K and TiII optical spectra of early-type stars taken mainly from the UVES Paranal Observatory Project, plus HI 21-cm spectra from the Vila-Elisa and Leiden-Dwingeloo surveys, which are employed to obtain distances to intermediate and high velocity clouds. HI emission at a velocity of -117 km/s towards the sightline HD 30677 with NHI=1.7x10^19 cm-2 has no corresponding CaII K absorption, which has a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of 610. The star has a spectroscopically determined distance of 2.7-kpc, and hence sets this as a firm lower distance limit towards Anti-Centre cloud ACII. Towards another sightline (HD 46185), HI at +122 km/s and NHI=1.2x10^19 cm-2 is seen. The CaII K spectrum has a S/N = 780, although no absorption is observed at the cloud velocity. This similarly places a firm lower distance limit of 2.9-kpc towards this parcel of gas that may be an intermediate velocity cloud. The lack of intermediate velocity (IV) CaII K absorption towards HD 196426 at a S/N = 500 reinforces a lower distance limit of 700-pc towards this part of Complex gp, where NHI is 1.1x10^19 cm-2 and velocity is +78 km/s. Additionally, no IV CaII K is seen in absorption in the spectrum of HD 19445, which is strong in HI with NHI=8x10^19 cm-2 at -42 km/s, placing a firm although uninteresting lower distance limit of 39-pc to this part of IV South. Finally, no HV CaII K absorption is seen towards HD 115363 at a S/N = 410, placing a lower distance of 3.2-kpc towards the HVC gas at velocity of +224 km/s and NHI=5.2x10^19 cm-2. This gas is in the same region of the sky as complex WE (Wakker 2001), but at higher velocities. The non-detection of CaII K absorption sets a lower distance of 3.2-kpc towards the HVC, which is unsurprising if this feature is indeed related to the Magellanic System. ",0,0
"The search for elementary excitations with fractional quantum numbers is a central challenge in modern condensed matter physics. We explore the possibility in a realistic model for several materials, the spin-1/2 spatially anisotropic frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnet in two dimensions. By restricting the Hilbert space to that expressed by exact eigenstates of the Heisenberg chain, we derive an effective Schrödinger equation valid in the weak interchain-coupling regime. The dynamical spin correlations from this approach agree quantitatively with inelastic neutron measurements on the triangular antiferromagnet Cs_2CuCl_4. The spectral features in such antiferromagnets can be attributed to two types of excitations: descendents of one-dimensional spinons of individual chains, and coherently propagating 'triplon' bound states of spinon pairs. We argue that triplons are generic features of spatially anisotropic frustrated antiferromagnets, and arise because the bound spinon pair lowers its kinetic energy by propagating between chains.

"Statistical modeling of experimental physical laws is based on the probability density function of measured variables. It is expressed by experimental data via a kernel estimator. The kernel is determined objectively by the scattering of data during calibration of experimental setup. A physical law, which relates measured variables, is optimally extracted from experimental data by the conditional average estimator. It is derived directly from the kernel estimator and corresponds to a general nonparametric regression. The proposed method is demonstrated by the modeling of a return map of noisy chaotic data. In this example, the nonparametric regression is used to predict a future value of chaotic time series from the present one. The mean predictor error is used in the definition of predictor quality, while the redundancy is expressed by the mean square distance between data points. Both statistics are used in a new definition of predictor cost function. From the minimum of the predictor cost function, a proper number of data in the model is estimated. ",0,0
"In the LCDM cosmology dark matter halos grow primarily through the accretion of smaller halos. Much of the mass in a halo of 10^14Msun comes in through accretion of10^13Msun halos. If each such halo hosted one luminous red galaxy (LRG) then the accretion of so many halos is at odds with the observed number of LRGs in clusters unless these accreted LRGs merge or disrupt on relatively short timescales ( 2Gyr). These timescales are consistent with classical dynamical friction arguments, and imply that 2-3 LRGs have merged or disrupted within each halo more massive than 10^14Msun by z=0. The total amount of stellar mass brought into these massive halos by z=0 is consistent with observations once the intracluster light (ICL) is included. If disrupted LRGs build up the ICL, then the hierarchical growth of massive halos implies that a substantial amount of ICL should also surround satellite LRGs, as suggested by recent observations of the Virgo cluster. Finally, we point out that these results are entirely consistent with a non-evolving clustering strength and halo occupation distribution, and note that observations of the latter in fact support the hypothesis that merging/disruption of massive galaxies does indeed take place at late times.

"We study theoretically the entanglement created in a scattering between an electron, incoming from a source lead, and another electron bound in the ground state of a quantum dot, connected to two leads. We analyze the role played by the different kinds of resonances in the transmission spectra and by the number of scattering channels, into the amount of quantum correlations between the two identical carriers. It is shown that the entanglement between their energy states is not sensitive to the presence of Breit-Wigner resonances, while it presents a peculiar behavior in correspondence of Fano peaks: two close maxima separated by a minimum, for a two-channel scattering, a single maximum for a multi-channel scattering. Such a behavior is ascribed to the different mechanisms characterizing the two types of resonances. Our results suggest that the production and detection of entanglement in quantum dot structures may be controlled by the manipulation of Fano resonances through external fields. ",0,0
"A confluence of numerical and theoretical results leads us to conjecture that the Hilbert-Schmidt separability probabilities of the 15- and 9-dimensional convex sets of complex and real two-qubit states (representable by 4 x 4 density matrices rho) are 8/33 and 8/17, respectively. Central to our reasoning are the modifications of two ansatze, recently advanced (quant-ph/0609006), involving incomplete beta functions B_nu(a,b), where nu= (rho_11 rho_44)/(rho_22 rho_33). We, now, set the separability function S_real(nu) propto B_nu(nu,1/2,2) =(2/3) (3-nu) sqrtnu. Then, in the complex case – conforming to a pattern we find, manifesting the Dyson indices (1, 2, 4) of random matrix theory– we take S_complex(nu) propto S_real^2 (nu). We also investigate the real and complex qubit-qutrit cases. Now, there are two Bloore ratio variables, nu_1= (rho_11 rho_55)(rho_22 rho_44), nu_2= (rho_22 rho_66)(rho_33 rho_55), but they appear to remarkably coalesce into the product, eta = nu_1 nu_2 = rho_11 ρ_66ρ_33 ρ_44, so that the real and complex separability functions are again univariate in nature.

"The two-body interaction in dilute solutions of polymer chains in good solvents can be modeled by means of effective bounded potentials, the simplest of which being that of penetrable spheres (PSs). In this paper we construct two simple analytical theories for the structural properties of PS fluids: a low-temperature (LT) approximation, that can be seen as an extension to PSs of the well-known solution of the Percus-Yevick (PY) equation for hard spheres, and a high-temperature (HT) approximation based on the exact asymptotic behavior in the limit of infinite temperature. Monte Carlo simulations for a wide range of temperatures and densities are performed to assess the validity of both theories. It is found that, despite their simplicity, the HT and LT approximations exhibit a fair agreement with the simulation data within their respective domains of applicability, so that they complement each other. A comparison with numerical solutions of the PY and the hypernetted-chain approximations is also carried out, the latter showing a very good performance, except inside the core at low temperatures.

"We study the evolution and saturation of the gluon distribution function in the quark-gluon plasma as probed by a propagating parton and its effect on the computation of jet quenching or transport parameter q̂. For thermal partons, the saturation scale Q^2_s is found to be proportional to the Debye screening mass μ_D^2. For hard probes, evolution at small x=Q^2_s/6ET leads to jet energy dependence of q̂. We study this dependence for both a conformal gauge theory in weak and strong coupling limit and for (pure gluon) QCD. The energy dependence can be used to extract the shear viscosity η of the medium since η can be related to the transport parameter for thermal partons in a transport description. We also derive upper bounds on the transport parameter for both energetic and thermal partons. The later leads to a lower bound on shear viscosity-to-entropy density ratio which is consistent with the conjectured lower bound η/s≥ 1/4π. We also discuss the implications on the study of jet quenching at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and the CERN Large Hadron Collider and the bulk properties of the dense matter. ",0,0
"Any color singlet or octet ccbar pair is created at short distances and then expands to a full size of J/psi. Such a dynamical evolution process is included here in calculations for the J/psi number distribution as a function of transverse momentum and rapidity in central Au-Au collisions at both RHIC and LHC energies. The ccbar pairs are produced in the initial collision and in the partonic system during the prethermal and thermal stages through the partonic channels ab to ccbar [2S+1L_J] and ab to ccbar [2S+1L_J]x, and then they dissociate in the latter two stages. Dissociation of ccbar in the medium occurs via two reactions: (a) color singlet ccbar plus a gluon turns to color octet ccbar, (b) color octet ccbar plus a gluon persists as color octet. There are modest yields of ccbar in the prethermal stage at RHIC energy and through the reactions ab to ccbar [2S+1L_J] at LHC energy for partons with large average momentum in the prethermal stage at both collider energies and in the thermal stage at LHC energy. Production from the partonic system competes with the suppression of the initial yield in the deconfined medium. Consequently, a bulge within -1.5<y<1.5 has been found for the J/psi number distribution and the ratio of J/psi number distributions for Au-Au collisions to nucleon-nucleon collisions. This bulge is caused by the partonic system and is thus an indicator of a deconfined partonic medium. Based on this result we suggest the rapidity region worth measuring in future experiments at RHIC and LHC to be -3<y<3. ",0,0

"The study of the innermost circumstellar layers around AGB stars is crucial to understand how these envelopes are formed and evolve. The SiO maser emission occurs at a few stellar radii from the central star, providing direct information on the stellar pulsation and on the chemical and physical properties of these regions. Our data also shed light on several aspects of the SiO maser pumping theory that are not well understood yet. We aim to determine the relative spatial distribution of the 43 GHz and 86 GHz SiO maser lines in the oxygen-rich evolved star R Leo. We have imaged with milliarcsecond resolution, by means of Very Long Baseline Interferometry, the 43 GHz (28SiO v=1, 2 J=1-0 and 29SiO v=0 J=1-0) and 86 GHz (28SiO v=1 J=2-1 and 29SiO v=0 J=2-1) masing regions. We confirm previous results obtained in other oxygen-rich envelopes. In particular, when comparing the 43 GHz emitting regions, the 28SiO v=2 transition is produced in an inner layer, closer to the central star. On the other hand, the 86 GHz line arises in a clearly farther shell. We have also mapped for the first time the 29SiO v=0 J=1-0 emission in R Leo. The already reported discrepancy between the observed distributions of the different maser lines and the theoretical predictions is also found in R Leo. ",0,0
"An interaction between electrons and lattice vibrations (phonons) results in two fundamental quantum phenomena in solids: in three dimensions it can turn a metal into a superconductor whereas in one dimension it can turn a metal into an insulator. In two dimensions (2D) both superconductivity and charge-density waves (CDW) are believed to be anomalous. In superconducting cuprates, critical transition temperatures are unusually high and the energy gap may stay unclosed even above these temperatures (pseudogap). In CDW-bearing dichalcogenides the resistivity below the transition can decrease with temperature even faster than in the normal phase and a basic prerequisite for the CDW, the favourable nesting conditions (when some sections of the Fermi surface appear shifted by the same vector), seems to be absent. Notwithstanding the existence of alternatives to conventional theories, both phenomena in 2D still remain the most fascinating puzzles in condensed matter physics. Using the latest developments in high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) here we show that the normal-state pseudogap also exists in one of the most studied 2D examples, dichalcogenide 2H-TaSe2, and the formation of CDW is driven by a conventional nesting instability, which is masked by the pseudogap. Our findings reconcile and explain a number of unusual, as previously believed, experimental responses as well as disprove many alternative theoretical approaches. The magnitude, character and anisotropy of the 2D-CDW pseudogap are intriguingly similar to those seen in superconducting cuprates. ",0,0
"In the coming decades, research in extrasolar planets aims to advance two goals: 1) detecting and characterizing low-mass planets increasingly similar to the Earth, and 2) improving our understanding of planet formation. We present a new planet detection method that is capable of making large advances towards both of these objectives and describe a modest network of telescopes that is able to make the requisite observations. In a system where a known planet transits its host star, a second planet in that system will cause the time between transits to vary. These transit timing variations can be used to infer the orbital elements and mass of the perturbing planet even if it has a mass that is smaller than the mass of the Earth. This detection technique complements other techniques because it is most sensitive in mean-motion resonances where, due to degeneracies, other techniques have reduced sensitivity. Small ground-based observatories have already exceeded the photometric precision necessary to detect sub-Earth mass planets. However, TTV planet searches are currently limited by the relatively small number of high-precision transit data and insufficient observing time on existing telescopes. These issues will be compounded as the number of known transiting planets suitable for TTV study will increase substantially in the near future. A relatively modest investment in a ground-based network of small (∼ 0.5m telescopes could provide the needed coverage and so dramatically increase the effectiveness of transit timing observations.

"We use the Barnard 68 dark globule as a test case for a spherically symmetric PDR model exposed to low-UV radiation fields. With a roughly spherical morphology and an accurately determined density profile, Barnard 68 is ideal for this purpose.

We compare the spherically symmetric PDR model by Stoerzer, StutzkiSternberg (1996) to observations of the three lowest rotational transitions of 12CO, 13CO J = 2-1 and J = 3-2 as well as the [CI] 3P_1-3P_0 fine structure transition.

We find it difficult to simultaneously model the observed 12CO and 13CO emission. The 12CO and [CI] emission can be explained by a PDR model with a external FUV field of 1-0.75 chi_0, but this model fails to reproduce the observed 13CO by a factor of2.

"The social media site Flickr allows users to upload their photos, annotate them with tags, submit them to groups, and also to form social networks by adding other users as contacts. Flickr offers multiple ways of browsing or searching it. One option is tag search, which returns all images tagged with a specific keyword. If the keyword is ambiguous, e.g., “beetle” could mean an insect or a car, tag search results will include many images that are not relevant to the sense the user had in mind when executing the query. We claim that users express their photography interests through the metadata they add in the form of contacts and image annotations. We show how to exploit this metadata to personalize search results for the user, thereby improving search performance. First, we show that we can significantly improve search precision by filtering tag search results by user's contacts or a larger social network that includes those contact's contacts. Secondly, we describe a probabilistic model that takes advantage of tag information to discover latent topics contained in the search results. The users' interests can similarly be described by the tags they used for annotating their images. The latent topics found by the model are then used to personalize search results by finding images on topics that are of interest to the user. ",0,0
"Redundancy of experimental data is the basic statistic from which the complexity of a natural phenomenon and the proper number of experiments needed for its exploration can be estimated. The redundancy is expressed by the entropy of information pertaining to the probability density function of experimental variables. Since the calculation of entropy is inconvenient due to integration over a range of variables, an approximate expression for redundancy is derived that includes only a sum over the set of experimental data about these variables. The approximation makes feasible an efficient estimation of the redundancy of data along with the related experimental information and information cost function. From the experimental information the complexity of the phenomenon can be simply estimated, while the proper number of experiments needed for its exploration can be determined from the minimum of the cost function. The performance of the approximate estimation of these statistics is demonstrated on two-dimensional normally distributed random data. ",0,0

"Prochter et al. 2006 recently found that the number density of strong intervening 0.5<z<2 MgII absorbers detected in gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow spectra is nearly 4 times larger than in QSO spectra. We have conducted a similar study using CIV absorbers. Our CIV sample, consisting of a total of 20 systems, is drawn from 3 high resolution and high to moderate S/N VLT/UVES spectra of 3 long-duration GRB afterglows, covering the redshift interval 1.6< z<3.1. The column density distribution and number density of this sample do not show any statistical difference with the same quantities measured in QSO spectra. We discuss several possibilities for the discrepancy between CIV and MgII absorbers and conclude that a higher dust extinction in the MgII QSO samples studied up to now would give the most straightforward solution. However, this effect is only important for the strong MgII absorbers. Regardless of the reasons for this discrepancy, this result confirms once more that GRBs can be used to detect a side of the universe that was unknown before, not necessarily connected with GRBs themselves, providing an alternative and fundamental investigative tool of the cosmic evolution of the universe.

"A three-dimensional system of interacting spins typically develops static long-range order when it is cooled. If the spins are quantum (S = 1/2), however, novel quantum paramagnetic states may appear. The most highly sought state among them is the resonating valence bond (RVB) state in which every pair of neighboring quantum spins form entangled spin singlets (valence bonds) and the singlets are quantum mechanically resonating amongst all the possible highly degenerate pairing states. Here we provide experimental evidence for such quantum paramagnetic states existing in frustrated antiferromagnets, ZnxCu4-x(OD)6Cl2, where the S = 1/2 magnetic Cu2+ moments form layers of a two-dimensional kagome lattice. We find that in Cu4(OD)6Cl2, where distorted kagome planes are weakly coupled to each other, a dispersionless excitation mode appears in the magnetic excitation spectrum below20 K, whose characteristics resemble those of quantum spin singlets in a solid state, known as a valence bond solid (VBS), that breaks translational symmetry. Doping nonmagnetic Zn2+ ions reduces the distortion of the kagome lattice, and weakens the interplane coupling but also dilutes the magnetic occupancy of the kagome lattice.

"Author offers and researches a new, cheap method for the extraction of freshwater from the Earth atmosphere. The suggected method is fundamentally dictinct from all existing methods that extract freshwater from air. All other industrial methods extract water from a saline water source (in most cases from seawater). This new method may be used at any point in the Earth except Polar Zones. It does not require long-distance freshwater transportation. If seawater is not utilized for increasing its productivity, this inexpensive new method is very environment-friendly. The author method has two working versions: (1) the first variant the warm (hot) atmospheric air is lifted by the inflatable tube in a high altitude and atmospheric steam is condenced into freswater: (2) in the second version, the warm air is pumped 20-30 meters under the sea-surface. In the first version, wind and solar heating of air are used for causing air flow. In version (2) wind and propeller are used for causing air movment.The first method does not need energy, the second needs a small amount. Moreover, in variant (1) the freshwater has a high pressure (>30 or more atm.) and can be used for production of energy such as electricity and in that way the freshwater cost is lower. For increasing the productivity the seawater is injected into air and solar air heater may be used. The solar air heater produces a huge amount of electricity as a very powerful electricity generation plant. The offered electricity installation in 100 - 200 times cheaper than any common electric plant of equivalent output.Key words: Extraction freshwater, method of getting freshwater, receiving energy from atmosphere, powerful renewal electric plant.

"CO observations have been so far the best way to trace molecular gas in external galaxies, but at low metallicity the gas mass deduced could be largely underestimated. At present, the kinematic information of CO data cubes are used to estimate virial masses and trace the total mass of the molecular clouds. Millimeter dust emission can also be used as a dense gas tracer and could unveil H2 envelopes lacking CO. These different tracers must be compared in different environments. This study compares virial masses to masses deduced from millimeter emission, in two GMC samples: the local molecular clouds in our Galaxy and their equivalents in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), one of the nearest low metallicity dwarf galaxy. In our Galaxy, mass estimates deduced from millimeter emission are consistent with masses deduced from gamma ray analysis and trace the total mass of the clouds. Virial masses are systematically larger (twice on average) than mass estimates from millimeter dust emission. This difference decreases toward high masses and has already been reported in previous studies. In the SMC however, molecular cloud masses deduced from SIMBA millimeter observations are systematically higher (twice on average for conservative values of the dust to gas ratio and dust emissivity) than the virial masses from SEST CO observations. The observed excess can not be accounted for by any plausible change of dust properties. Taking a general form for the virial theorem, we show that a magnetic field strength of15 micro Gauss in SMC clouds could provide additional support to the clouds and explain the difference observed. Masses of SMC molecular clouds have therefore been underestimated so far. Magnetic pressure may contribute significantly to their support. ",0,0
"We present a detailed analysis of an explicit model of warped D-brane inflation, incorporating the effects of moduli stabilization. We consider the potential for D3-brane motion in a warped conifold background that includes fluxes and holomorphically-embedded D7-branes involved in moduli stabilization. Although the D7-branes significantly modify the inflaton potential, they do not correct the quadratic term in the potential, and hence do not cause a uniform change in the slow-roll parameter eta. Nevertheless, we present a simple example based on the Kuperstein embedding of D7-branes, z_1=constant, in which the potential can be fine-tuned to be sufficiently flat for inflation. To derive this result, it is essential to incorporate the fact that the compactification volume changes slightly as the D3-brane moves. We stress that the compactification geometry dictates certain relationships among the parameters in the inflaton Lagrangian, and these microscopic constraints impose severe restrictions on the space of possible models. We note that the shape of the final inflaton potential differs from projections given in earlier studies: in configurations where inflation occurs, it does so near an inflection point. Finally, we comment on the difficulty of making precise cosmological predictions in this scenario. This is the companion paper to arXiv:0705.3837. ",0,0
"Recent three-dimensional radiative hydrodynamics simulations of protoplanetary disks report disparate disk behaviors, and these differences involve the importance of convection to disk cooling, the dependence of disk cooling on metallicity, and the stability of disks against fragmentation and clump formation. To guarantee trustworthy results, a radiative physics algorithm must demonstrate the capability to handle both the high and low optical depth regimes. We develop a test suite that can be used to demonstrate an algorithm's ability to relax to known analytic flux and temperature distributions, to follow a contracting slab, and to inhibit or permit convection appropriately. We then show that the radiative algorithm employed by Mejiá (2004) and Boley et al. (2006) and the algorithm employed by Cai et al. (2006) and Cai et al. (2007, in prep.) pass these tests with reasonable accuracy. In addition, we discuss a new algorithm that couples flux-limited diffusion with vertical rays, we apply the test suite, and we discuss the results of evolving the Boley et al. (2006) disk with this new routine. Although the outcome is significantly different in detail with the new algorithm, we obtain the same qualitative answers. Our disk does not cool fast due to convection, and it is stable to fragmentation. We find an effective α≈ 10^-2. In addition, transport is dominated by low-order modes. ",0,0
We present a diagrammatic formulation of a theory for the time dependence of density fluctuations in equilibrium systems of interacting Brownian particles. To facilitate derivation of the diagrammatic expansion we introduce a basis that consists of orthogonalized many-particle density fluctuations. We obtain an exact hierarchy of equations of motion for time-dependent correlations of orthogonalized density fluctuations. To simplify this hierarchy we neglect contributions to the vertices from higher-order cluster expansion terms. An iterative solution of the resulting equations can be represented by diagrams with three and four-leg vertices. We analyze the structure of the diagrammatic series for the time-dependent density correlation function and obtain a diagrammatic interpretation of reducible and irreducible memory functions. The one-loop self-consistent approximation for the latter function coincides with mode-coupling approximation for Brownian systems that was derived previously using a projection operator approach. ,0,0
"The relaxation of a dewetting contact line is investigated theoretically in the so-called 'Landau-Levich' geometry in which a vertical solid plate is withdrawn from a bath of partially wetting liquid. The study is performed in the framework of lubrication theory, in which the hydrodynamics is resolved at all length scales (from molecular to macroscopic). We investigate the bifurcation diagram for unperturbed contact lines, which turns out to be more complex than expected from simplified 'quasi-static' theories based upon an apparent contact angle. Linear stability analysis reveals that below the critical capillary number of entrainment, Ca_c, the contact line is linearly stable at all wavenumbers. Away from the critical point the dispersion relation has an asymptotic behaviour sigma |q| and compares well to a quasi-static approach. Approaching Ca_c, however, a different mechanism takes over and the dispersion evolves from |q| to the more common q^2. These findings imply that contact lines can not be treated as universal objects governed by some effective law for the macroscopic contact angle, but viscous effects have to be treated explicitly.

"Previous molecular gas observations at arcsecond-scale resolution of the Seyfert 2 galaxy M51 suggest the presence of a dense circumnuclear rotating disk, which may be the reservoir for fueling the active nucleus and obscures it from direct view in the optical. However, our recent interferometric CO(3-2) observations show a hint of a velocity gradient perpendicular to the rotating disk, which suggests a more complex structure than previously thought. To image the putative circumnuclear molecular gas disk at sub-arcsecond resolution to better understand both the spatial distribution and kinematics of the molecular gas. We carried out CO(2-1) and CO(1-0) line observations of the nuclear region of M51 with the new A configuration of the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer, yielding a spatial resolution lower than 15 pc. The high resolution images show no clear evidence of a disk, aligned nearly east-west and perpendicular to the radio jet axis, as suggested by previous observations, but show two separate features located on the eastern and western sides of the nucleus. The western feature shows an elongated structure along the jet and a good velocity correspondence with optical emission lines associated with the jet, suggesting that this feature is a jet-entrained gas. The eastern feature is elongated nearly east-west ending around the nucleus. A velocity gradient appears in the same direction with increasingly blueshifted velocities near the nucleus. This velocity gradient is in the opposite sense of that previously inferred for the putative circumnuclear disk. Possible explanations for the observed molecular gas distribution and kinematics are that a rotating gas disk disturbed by the jet, gas streaming toward the nucleus, or a ring with another smaller counter- or Keplarian-rotating gas disk inside.

"We analyze the transmitted flux in a sample of 17 QSOs spectra at 5.74<zem<6.42 to obtain tighter constraints on the volume-averaged neutral hydrogen fraction, xHI, at z 6. We study separately the narrow transmission windows (peaks) and the wide dark portions (gaps) in the observed absorption spectra. By comparing the statistics of these spectral features with Lyalpha forest simulations, we conclude that xHI evolves smoothly from 10^-4.4 at z=5.3 to 10^-4.2 at z=5.6, with a robust upper limit xHI<0.36 at z=6.3. The frequency and physical sizes of the peaks imply an origin in cosmic underdense regions and/or in HII regions around faint quasars or galaxies. In one case (the intervening HII region of the faint quasar RD J1148+5253 at z=5.70 along the LOS of SDSS J1148+5251 at z=6.42) the increase of the peak spectral density is explained by the first-ever detected transverse proximity effect in the HI Lyalpha forest; this indicates that at least some peaks result from a locally enhanced radiation field. We then obtain a strong lower limit on the foreground QSO lifetime of tQ>11 Myr. The observed widths of the peaks are found to be systematically larger than the simulated ones. Reasons for such discrepancy might reside either in the photoionization equilibrium assumption or in radiative transfer effects. ",0,0
"Let M_g,[n], for 2g-2+n>0, be the D-M moduli stack of smooth curves of genus g labeled by n unordered distinct points. The main result of the paper is that a finite, connected étale cover M^ł of M_g,[n], defined over a sub-p-adic field k, is 'almost' anabelian in the sense conjectured by Grothendieck for curves and their moduli spaces.The precise result is the following. Let π_1( M^ł_k) be the geometric algebraic fundamental group of M^ł and let Out^*(π_1( M^ł_k)) be the group of its exterior automorphisms which preserve the conjugacy classes of elements corresponding to simple loops around the Deligne-Mumford boundary of M^ł (this is the '∗-condition' motivating the 'almost' above). Let us denote by Out^*_G_k(π_1( M^ł_k)) the subgroup consisting of elements which commute with the natural action of the absolute Galois group G_k of k. Let us assume, moreover, that the generic point of the D-M stack M^ł has a trivial automorphisms group. Then, there is a natural isomorphism:Aut_k( M^ł)≅Out^*_G_k(π_1( M^ł_k)). This partially extends to moduli spaces of curves the anabelian properties proved by Mochizuki for hyperbolic curves over sub-p-adic fields. ",0,0
"Following Georgi's unparticle scheme, we examine the effective couplings between neutrinos and unparticle operators. As an immediate consequence, neutrinos become unstable and can decay into the unparticle stuff. Assuming the dimension transmutation scale is around Λ^_ U∼ 1TeV, we implement the cosmological limit on the neutrino lifetime to constrain the neutrino-unparticle couplings for different scaling dimensions d. In addition, provided that the electron-unparticle coupling is restricted due to the precise measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment of electron, we calculate the unparticle contribution to the neutrino-electron elastic scattering. It is more important to jointly deal with the couplings of the unparticle to the standard model particles rather than separately. Taking into account both electron- and neutrino-unparticle couplings, we find that the scaling dimension of the scalar unparticle should lie in the narrow range 1 < d < 2 by requiring the observables to be physically meaningful. However, there is no consistent range of d for the vector unparticle operator. ",0,0
"In this paper we consider the question of the degree to which negative and positive energy are intertwined. We examine in more detail a previously studied quantum state of the massless minimally coupled scalar field, which we call a “Helfer state”. This is a state in which the energy density can be made arbitrarily negative over an arbitrarily large region of space, but only at one instant in time. In the Helfer state, the negative energy density is accompanied by rapidly time-varying energy fluxes. It is the latter feature which allows the quantum inequalities, bounds which restrict the magnitude and duration of negative energy, to hold for this class of states. An observer who initially passes through the negative energy region will quickly encounter fluxes of positive energy which subsequently enter the region. We examine in detail the correlation between the energy density and flux in the Helfer state in terms of their expectation values. We then study the correlation function between energy density and flux in the Minkowski vacuum state, for a massless minimally coupled scalar field in both two and four dimensions. In this latter analysis we examine correlation functions rather than expectation values. Remarkably, we see qualitatively similar behavior to that in the Helfer state. More specifically, an initial negative energy vacuum fluctuation in some region of space is correlated with a subsequent flux fluctuation of positive energy into the region. We speculate that the mechanism which ensures that the quantum inequalities hold in the Helfer state, as well as in other quantum states associated with negative energy, is, at least in some sense, already “encoded” in the fluctuations of the vacuum.

"We examine recent evidence from the luminosity-redshift relation of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) for the ∼ 3 σ detection of a “Hubble bubble” – a departure of the local value of the Hubble constant from its globally averaged value <cit.>. By comparing the MLCS2k2 fits used in that study to the results from other light-curve fitters applied to the same data, we demonstrate that this is related to the interpretation of SN color excesses (after correction for a light-curve shape-color relation) and the presence of a color gradient across the local sample. If the slope of the linear relation (β) between SN color excess and luminosity is fit empirically, then the bubble disappears. If, on the other hand, the color excess arises purely from Milky Way-like dust, then SN data clearly favors a Hubble bubble. We demonstrate that SN data give β≃ 2, instead of the β≃ 4 one would expect from purely Milky-Way-like dust. This suggests that either SN intrinsic colors are more complicated than can be described with a single light-curve shape parameter, or that dust around SN is unusual. Disentangling these possibilities is both a challenge and an opportunity for large-survey SN Ia cosmology. ",0,0
"We apply a recently developed perturbative formalism which describes the evolution under their self-gravity of particles displaced from a perfect lattice to quantify precisely, up to shell crossing, the effects of discreteness in dissipationless cosmological N-body simulations. We give simple expressions, explicitly dependent on the particle density, for the evolution of power in each mode as a function of red-shift. For typical starting red-shifts the effect of finite particle number is to slow down slightly the growth of power compared to that in the fluid limit (e.g. by about ten percent at half the Nyquist frequency), and to induce also dispersion in the growth as a function of direction at a comparable level. In the limit that the initial red-shift tends to infinity, at fixed particle density, the evolution in fact diverges from that in the fluid limit (described by the Zeldovich approximation). Contrary to widely held belief, this means that a simulation started at a red-shift much higher than the red-shift of shell crossing actually gives a worse, rather than a better, result. We also study how these effects are modified when there is a small-scale regularization of the gravitational force. We show that such a smoothing may reduce the anisotropy of the discreteness effects, but it then increases their average effect. This behaviour illustrates the fact that the discreteness effects described here are distinct from those usually considered in this context, due to two-body collisions. Indeed the characteristic time for divergence from the collisionless limit is proportional to N^2/3, rather than N/ log N in the latter case. ",0,0
"We give formulae for the Ozsvath-Szabo invariants of 4-manifolds X obtained by fiber sum of two manifolds M_1, M_2 along surfaces S_1, S_2 having trivial normal bundle and genus g>0. The formulae follow from a general theorem on the Ozsvath-Szabo invariants of the result of gluing two 4-manifolds along a common boundary, which is phrased in terms of relative invariants of the pieces. These relative invariants take values in a version of Heegaard Floer homology with coefficients in modules over certain Novikov rings; the fiber sum formula follows from the theorem that this 'perturbed' version of Heegaard Floer theory recovers the usual Ozsvath-Szabo invariants, when the 4-manifold in question has b^+>1. The construction allows an extension of the definition of the Ozsvath-Szabo invariants to 4-manifolds having b^+ = 1 depending on certain choices, in close analogy with Seiberg-Witten theory. The product formulae lead quickly to calculations of the Ozsvath-Szabo invariants of various 4-manifolds; in all cases the results are in accord with the conjectured equivalence between the Ozsvath-Szabo and Seiberg-Witten invariants.

"We present the first systematic investigation of the [NeV] (14um/24um) and [SIII] (18um/33um) infrared line flux ratios, traditionally used to estimate the density of the ionized gas, in a sample of 41 Type 1 and Type 2 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) observed with the Infrared Spectrograph on board Spitzer. The majority of galaxies with both [NeV] lines detected have observed [NeV] line flux ratios consistent with or below the theoretical low density limit, based on calculations using currently available collision strengths and ignoring absorption and stimulated emission. We find that Type 2 AGNs have lower line flux ratios than Type 1 AGNs and that all of the galaxies with line flux ratios below the low density limit are Type 2 AGNs. We argue that differential infrared extinction to the [NeV] emitting region due to dust in the obscuring torus is responsible for the ratios below the low density limit and we suggest that the ratio may be a tracer of the inclination angle of the torus to our line of sight. Because the temperature of the gas, the amount of extinction, and the effect of absorption and stimulated emission on the line ratios are all unknown, we are not able to determine the electron densities associated with the [NeV] line flux ratios for the objects in our sample. We also find that the [SIII] emission from the galaxies in our sample is extended and originates primarily in star forming regions. Since the emission from low-ionization species is extended, any analysis using line flux ratios from such species obtained from slits of different sizes is invalid for most nearby galaxies. ",0,0
"This paper quantifies the information rate of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with finite rate channel state feedback and power on/off strategy. In power on/off strategy, a beamforming vector (beam) is either turned on (denoted by on-beam) with a constant power or turned off. We prove that the ratio of the optimal number of on-beams and the number of antennas converges to a constant for a given signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when the number of transmit and receive antennas approaches infinity simultaneously and when beamforming is perfect. Based on this result, a near optimal strategy, i.e., power on/off strategy with a constant number of on-beams, is discussed. For such a strategy, we propose the power efficiency factor to quantify the effect of imperfect beamforming. A formula is proposed to compute the maximum power efficiency factor achievable given a feedback rate. The information rate of the overall MIMO system can be approximated by combining the asymptotic results and the formula for power efficiency factor. Simulations show that this approximation is accurate for all SNR regimes. ",0,0
"Specific heat, dc- and ac-magnetic susceptibility are reported for a large single crystal of PrOs_4Sb_12 and, after grinding, its powder. The room temperature effective paramagnetic moment of the crystal was consistent with the Pr^3+ ionic configuration and full occupancy of the Pr-sublattice. The crystal showed two distinct anomalies in the specific heat and an overall discontinuity in C/T of more than 1000 mJ/K^2mol. The upper transition (at T_c1) was rounded, in an agreement with previous reports. The anomaly at T_c2 was very sharp, consistent with a good quality of the crystal. We observed a shoulder in χ' and two peaks in χ” below T_c1. However, there were no signatures in χ' of the lower temperature transition. PrOs_4Sb_12 is extremely sensitive to grinding, which suppresses the upper superconducting transition in both the specific heat and magnetic susceptibility. Δ C/T_c was reduced to 140 mJ/K^2 mol in the powdered sample. Existing data on ground, polished, and sliced crystals suggests the existence of a length scale of order 100 μ, characterizing the higher temperature superconducting phase. ",0,0
"We investigate the transport properties of ballistic quantum wires in the presence of Zeeman spin splittings and a spatially inhomogeneous Rashba interaction. The Zeeman interaction is extended along the wire and produces gaps in the energy spectrum which allow electron propagation only for spinors lying along a certain direction. For spins in the opposite direction the waves are evanescent far away from the Rashba region, which plays the role of the scattering center. The most interesting case occurs when the magnetic field is perpendicular to the Rashba field. Then, the spins of the asymptotic wavefunctions are not eigenfunctions of the Rashba Hamiltonian and the resulting coupling between spins in the Rashba region gives rise to sudden changes of the transmission probability when the Fermi energy is swept along the gap. After briefly examining the energy spectrum and eigenfunctions of a wire with extended Rashba coupling, we analyze the transmission through a region of localized Rashba interaction, in which a double interface separates a region of constant Rashba interaction from wire leads free from spin-orbit coupling. For energies slightly above the propagation threshold, we find the ubiquitous occurrence of transmission zeros (antiresonances) which are analyzed by matching methods in the one-dimensional limit. We find that a a minimal tight-binding model yields analytical transmission lineshapes of Fano antiresonance type. More general angular dependences of the external magnetic field is treated within projected Schroedinger equations with Hamiltonian matrix elements mixing wavefunction components. Finally, we consider a realistic quantum wire where the energy subbands are coupled via the Rashba intersubband coupling term and discuss its effect on the transmission zeros. ",0,0
"Very recently, we have performed a couple of experiments, KEK PS-E549/E570, for the detailed study of the strange tribaryon S^0(3115) obtained in KEK PS-E471. These experiments were performed to accumulate much higher statistics with improved experimental apparatusespecially for the better proton spectroscopy of the ^4He(stopped K^-, N) reaction. In contrast to the previous proton spectrum, no narrow (∼ 20 MeV) peak structure was found either in the inclusive ^4He(stopped K^-, p) or in the semi-inclusive ^4He(stopped K^-, pX^±) reaction channel, which is equivalent to the previous E471 event trigger condition. Detailed analysis of the present data and simulation shows that the peak, corresponding to S^0(3115), has been an experimental artifact. Present analysis does not exclude the possible existence of a much wider structure. To be sensitive to such structure and for better understanding of the non-mesonic K^- absorption reaction channel, detailed analysis of the data is in progress. ",0,0
"A static light scattering (SLS) study of bovine serum albumin (BSA) mixtures with two anionic graft copolymers of poly (sodium acrylate-co-sodium 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulphonate)-graft-poly (N, N-dimethylacrylamide), with a high composition in poly (N, N-dimethylacrylamide) (PDMAM) side chains, revealed the formation of oppositely charged complexes, at pH lower than 4.9, the isoelectric point of BSA. The core-corona nanoparticles formed at pH = 3.00, were characterized. Their molecular weight and radius of gyration were determined by SLS, while their hydrodynamic radius was determined by dynamic light scattering. Small angle neutron scattering measurements were used to determine the radius of the insoluble complexes, comprising the core of the particles. The values obtained indicated that their size and aggregation number of the nanoparticles, were smaller when the content of the graft copolymers in neutral PDMAM side chains was higher. Such particles should be interesting drug delivery candidates, if the gastrointestinal tract was to be used. ",0,0
"We use a series of N-body/smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations and analytic arguments to show that the presence of an effective temperature floor in the interstellar medium at T_F10^4 K naturally explains the tendency for low-mass galaxies to be more spheroidal, more gas rich, and less efficient in converting baryons into stars than larger galaxies. The trend arises because gas pressure support becomes important compared to angular momentum support in small dark matter haloes. We suggest that dwarf galaxies with rotational velocities40 km/s do not originate as thin discs, but rather are born as thick, puffy systems. If accreted on to larger haloes, tenuous dwarfs of this kind will be more susceptible to gas loss or tidal transformation than scaled-down versions of larger spirals. For a constant temperature floor, pressure support becomes less important in large haloes, and this produces a tendency for massive isolated galaxies to have thinner discs and more efficient star formation than their less massive counterparts, as observed.

"Traditional parallel schedulers running on cluster supercomputers support only static scheduling, where the number of processors allocated to an application remains fixed throughout the execution of the job. This results in under-utilization of idle system resources thereby decreasing overall system throughput.

The resizing library in ReSHAPE includes support for releasing and acquiring processors and efficiently redistributing application state to a new set of processors. In this paper, we derive an algorithm for redistributing two-dimensional block-cyclic arrays from P to Q processors, organized as 2-D processor grids. The algorithm ensures a contention-free communication schedule for data redistribution if P_r ≤ Q_r and P_c ≤ Q_c. In other cases, the algorithm implements circular row and column shifts on the communication schedule to minimize node contention. ",0,0
"The space-time geometry is considered to be a physical geometry, i.e. a geometry described completely by the world function. All geometrical concepts and geometric objects are taken from the proper Euclidean geometry. They are expressed via the Euclidean world function σ_E and declared to be concepts and objects of any physical geometry, provided the Euclidean world function σ_E is replaced by the world function σof the physical geometry in question. The set of physical geometries is more powerful, than the set of Riemannian geometries, and one needs to choose a true space-time geometry. In general, the physical geometry is multivariant (there are many vectors which are equivalent to a given vector, but are not equivalent between themselves). The multivariance admits one to describe quantum effects as geometric effects and to consider existence of elementary particles as a geometrical problem, when the possibility of the physical existence of an elementary geometric object in the form of a physical body is determined by the space-time geometry. Multivariance admits one to describe discrete and continuous geometries, using the same technique. A use of physical geometry admits one to realize the geometrical approach to the quantum theory and to the theory of elementary particles. ",0,0

"We show individual high resolution spectra of components A, B, and C of the nearby late-M type multiple system LHS 1070. Component A is a mid-M star, B and C are known to have masses at the threshold to brown dwarfs. From our spectra we measure rotation velocities and the mean magnetic field for all three components individually. We find magnetic flux on the order of several kilo-Gauss in all components. The rotation velocities of the two late-M objects B and C are similar (vsini = 16km/s), the earlier A component is spinning only at about half that rate. This suggests weakening of net rotational braking at late-M spectral type, and that the lack of slowly rotating late-M and L dwarfs is real. Furthermore, we found that magnetic flux in the B component is about twice as strong as in component C at similar rotation rate. This indicates that rotational braking is not proportional to magnetic field strength in fully convective objects, and that a different field topology is the reason for the weak braking in low mass objects.

"Let α be a polynomial Poisson bivector on a finite-dimensional vector space V over ℂ. Then Kontsevich [K97] gives a formula for a quantization f⋆ g of the algebra S(V)^*.

"Using the “Scenario Machine” we have carried out a population synthesis of X-ray binaries for the purpose of modelling of X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) in different types of galaxies: star burst, spiral, and elliptical. This computer code allows to calculate, by using Monte Carlo simulations, the evolution of a large ensemble of binary systems, with proper accounting for the spin evolution of magnetized neutron stars.We show that the XLF has no universal type. It depends on the star formation rate in the galaxy. Also it is of importance to take into account the evolution of binary systems and life times of X-ray stages in theoretical models of such functions. We have calculated cumulative and differential XLFs for the galaxy with the constant star formation rate. Also we have calculated cumulative luminosity functions for different intervals of time after the star formation burst in the galaxy and curves depicting the evolution of the X-ray luminosity after the star formation burst in the galaxy.

"Because of the limit in the number of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with available redshifts and spectra, all current investigations on the correlation among GRB variables use burst samples with redshifts that span a very large range. The evolution and selection effects have thus been ignored, which might have important influence on the results. In this Letter, we divide the 48 long-duration GRBs in Amati (2006, 2007) into four groups with redshift from low to high, each group contains 12 GRBs. Then we fit each group with the Amati relation log E_ = a + b log E_, and check if the parameters a and b evolve with the GRB redshift. We find that a and b vary with the mean redshift of the GRBs in each group systematically and significantly. Monte-Carlo simulations show that there is only ∼ 4 percent of chance that the variation is caused by the selection effect arising from the fluence limit. Hence, our results may indicate that GRBs evolve strongly with the cosmological redshift. ",0,0
"Transiting extrasolar planets are now discovered jointly by photometric surveys and by radial velocimetry. We want to determine whether the different data sets are compatible between themselves and with models of the evolution of extrasolar planets. We simulate directly a population of stars corresponding to the OGLE transit survey and assign them planetary companions based on radial velocimetry discoveries. We use a model of the evolution and structure of giant planets assuming a variable fraction of heavy elements. The output list of detectable planets of the simulations is compared to the real detections. We confirm that the radial velocimetry and photometric survey data sets are compatible within the statistical errors, assuming that planets with periods between 1 and 2 days are approximately 5 times less frequent than planets with periods between 2 and 5 days. We show that evolution models fitting present observational constraints predict a lack of small giant planets with large masses. We also identify distinct populations of planets: those with short periods (P < 10d) are only found in orbit around metal-rich stars with [Fe/H] > -0.07. We further confirm the relative absence of low-mass giant planets at small orbital distances. ",0,0
"Local pure states are an important resource for quantum computing. The problem of distilling local pure states from mixed ones can be cast in an information theoretic paradigm. The bipartite version of this problem where local purity must be distilled from an arbitrary quantum state shared between two parties, Alice and Bob, is closely related to the problem of separating quantum and classical correlations in the state and in particular, to a measure of classical correlations called the one-way distillable common randomness. In Phys. Rev. A 71, 062303 (2005), the optimal rate of local purity distillation is derived when many copies of a bipartite quantum state are shared between Alice and Bob, and the parties are allowed unlimited use of a unidirectional dephasing channel. In the present paper, we extend this result to the setting in which the use of the channel is bounded. We demonstrate that in the case of a classical-quantum system, the expression for the local purity distilled is efficiently computable and provide examples with their tradeoff curves. ",0,0
"We study Gaussian valence bond states of continuous variable systems, obtained as the outputs of projection operations from an ancillary space of M infinitely entangled bonds connecting neighboring sites, applied at each of N sites of an harmonic chain. The entanglement distribution in Gaussian valence bond states can be controlled by varying the input amount of entanglement engineered in a (2M+1)-mode Gaussian state known as the building block, which is isomorphic to the projector applied at a given site. We show how this mechanism can be interpreted in terms of multiple entanglement swapping from the chain of ancillary bonds, through the building blocks. We provide optical schemes to produce bisymmetric three-mode Gaussian building blocks (which correspond to a single bond, M=1), and study the entanglement structure in the output Gaussian valence bond states. The usefulness of such states for quantum communication protocols with continuous variables, like telecloning and teleportation networks, is finally discussed. ",0,0

WT identities implied by an exact fermionic symmetry of the formulation are confirmed in fair accuracy and, for most of these identities, the quantum effect of dynamical fermions is clearly observed. For WT identities expected only in the continuum limit, the results seem to be consistent with the behavior expected from supersymmetry, although we do not see clear distintion from the quenched simulation. We measure also the expectation values of renormalized gauge-invariant bi-linear operators of scalar fields. ",0,0

"With the use of the AdS/CFT dictionary, a five-dimensional effective description of dynamical electro-weak symmetry breaking with walking behavior is constructed. The minimal model contains only two new parameters, the confinement scale and the effective coupling of the new strong sector. This parameter space is restricted by the precision electro-weak constraints and by the requirement that the five-dimensional coupling be perturbative (corresponding to the large-N regime in four-dimensional language). The lightest observable new states are a set of four nearly degenerate spin-1 states with the same quantum numbers as the standard-model electro-weak gauge bosons, and masses in the few TeV range. Their decay rate is dominated by two-fermion final states. The number of pp -> mu mu and pp -> mu nu events is studied as a function of the LHC integrated luminosity and of the two free parameters. Discovery at the LHC is possible over a significant part of the allowed parameter space up to masses of 4 TeV already with 10/fm of integrated luminosity. ",0,0
"In time hopping impulse radio, N_f pulses of duration T_c are transmitted for each information symbol. This gives rise to two types of processing gain: (i) pulse combining gain, which is a factor N_f, and (ii) pulse spreading gain, which is N_c=T_f/T_c, where T_f is the mean interval between two subsequent pulses. This paper investigates the trade-off between these two types of processing gain in the presence of timing jitter. First, an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel is considered and approximate closed form expressions for bit error probability are derived for impulse radio systems with and without pulse-based polarity randomization. Both symbol-synchronous and chip-synchronous scenarios are considered. The effects of multiple-access interference and timing jitter on the selection of optimal system parameters are explained through theoretical analysis. Finally, a multipath scenario is considered and the trade-off between processing gains of a synchronous impulse radio system with pulse-based polarity randomization is analyzed. The effects of the timing jitter, multiple-access interference and inter-frame interference are investigated. Simulation studies support the theoretical results. ",0,0
"We present a deep, wide-field photometric survey of the newly-discovered Hercules dwarf spheroidal galaxy, based on data from the Large Binocular Telescope. Images in B, V and r were obtained with the Large Binocular Camera covering a 23' times 23' field of view to a magnitude of25.5 (5 sigma). This permitted the construction of colour-magnitude diagrams that reach approximately 1.5 magnitudes below the Hercules main sequence turnoff. Three-filter photometry allowed us to preferentially select probable Hercules member stars, and examine the structure of this system at a previously unattained level. We find that the Hercules dwarf is highly elongated (3:1), considerably more so than any other dSph satellite of the Milky Way except the disrupting Sagittarius dwarf. While we cannot rule out that the unusual structure is intrinsic to Hercules as an equilibrium system, our results suggest tidal disruption as a likely cause of this highly elliptical structure. Given the relatively large Galactocentric distance of this system (132 +/- 12 kpc), signs of tidal disruption would require the Hercules dwarf to be on a highly eccentric orbit around the Milky Way.

"We have studied the maser emission from a thin, planar, gaseous ring in Keplerian rotation around a central mass observed edge-on. The absorption coefficient within the ring is assumed to follow a power law dependence with the distance from the central mass as, k=k0r^-q. We have calculated position-velocity diagrams for the most intense maser features, for different values of the exponent q. We have found that, depending on the value of q, these diagrams can be qualitatively different. The most intense maser emission at a given velocity can either come mainly from regions close to the inner or outer edges of the amplifying ring or from the line perpendicular to the line of sight and passing through the central mass (as is commonly assumed). Particularly, when q>1 the position-velocity diagram is qualitatively similar to the one observed for the water maser emission in the nucleus of the galaxy NGC 4258. In the context of this simple model, we conclude that in this object the absorption coefficient depends on the radius of the amplifying ring as a decreasing function, in order to have significant emission coming from the inner edge of the ring.

"We estimate the dust temperatures of the clumps in the rho Oph main cloud taking into account the 3D geometry of the region, and external heating from the interstellar radiation field and from HD147879,a nearby luminous B2V star, which is believed to dominate the radiation field in the region. We find that the regions where prestellar cores are observed (i.e. at optical visual extinctions >7 mag) are colder than10-11K. These dust temperatures are smaller than those which previous studies of the same region have assumed. We use the new dust temperatures to estimate the masses of the prestellar cores in the rho Oph main cloud from mm observations, and we find core masses that are larger than previous estimates by a factor of2-3. This affects the core mass function (CMF) of the region; we find that the mass at which the core mass spectrum steepens from a slope alpha 1.5 to a slope alpha 2.5 has moved from0.5 Msun to1Msun. In contrast with the CMF in other star forming regions (e.g. Orion), there is no indication for a turnover down to the completeness limit ( 0.2Msun), but the CMF may flatten at around0.4Msun. We generalize our results to the prestellar cores in Taurus and in Orion. In Taurus the ambient radiation field heating the prestellar cores is believed to be weaker than than that in rho Oph. Hence, the dust temperatures of the cores in Taurus are expected to be below10-11 K.In Orion the radiation field is believed to be 10^3 times stronger than the standard interstellar radiation field. Based on this assumption we estimate that the dust temperatures of the prestellar cores in Orion are around20-30K. ",0,0
"A coarse-grained variational model is used to investigate the polymer dynamics of barrier crossing for a diverse set of two-state folding proteins. The model gives reliable folding rate predictions provided excluded volume terms that induce minor structural cooperativity are included in the interaction potential. In general, the cooperative folding routes have sharper interfaces between folded and unfolded regions of the folding nucleus and higher free energy barriers. The calculated free energy barriers are strongly correlated with native topology as characterized by contact order. Increasing the rigidity of the folding nucleus changes the local structure of the transition state ensemble non-uniformly across the set of protein studied. Neverthless, the calculated prefactors k0 are found to be relatively uniform across the protein set, with variation in 1/k0 less than a factor of five. This direct calculation justifies the common assumption that the prefactor is roughly the same for all small two-state folding proteins. Using the barrier heights obtained from the model and the best fit monomer relaxation time 30ns, we find that 1/k0 (1-5)us (with average 1/k0 4us). This model can be extended to study subtle aspects of folding such as the variation of the folding rate with stability or solvent viscosity, and the onset of downhill folding. ",0,0
"Context: L'-band (3.8 micron) images of the Galactic Center show a large number of thin filaments in the mini-spiral, located west of the mini-cavity and along the inner edge of the Northern Arm. One possible mechanism that could produce such structures is the interaction of a central wind with the mini-spiral. Additionally, we identify similar features that appear to be associated with stars. Aims: We present the first proper motion measurements of the thin dust filaments observed in the central parsec around SgrA* and investigate possible mechanisms that could be responsible for the observed motions. Methods: The observations have been carried out using the NACO adaptive optics system at the ESO VLT. The images have been transformed to a common coordinate system and features of interest were extracted. Then a cross-correlation technique could be performed in order to determine the offsets between the features with respect to their position in the reference epoch. Results: We derive the proper motions of a number of filaments and 2 cometary shaped dusty sources close (in projection) to SgrA*. We show that the shape and the motion of the filaments does not agree with a purely Keplerian motion of the gas in the potential of the supermassive black hole at the position of SgrA*. Therefore, additional mechanisms must be responsible for their formation and motion. We argue that the properties of the filaments are probably related to an outflow from the disk of young mass-losing stars around SgrA*. In part, the outflow may originate from the black hole itself. We also present some evidence and theoretical considerations that the outflow may be collimated. ",0,0

"We apply the Lunin–Maldacena construction of gravity duals to beta-deformed gauge theories to a class of Type IIB backgrounds with U(1)^3 global symmetry, which include the multicenter D3-brane backgrounds dual to the Coulomb branch of N=4 super Yang-Mills and the rotating D3-brane backgrounds dual to the theory at finite temperature and chemical potential. After a general discussion, we present the full form of the deformed metrics for three special cases, which can be used for the study of various aspects of the marginally-deformed gauge theories. We also construct the Penrose limits of the solutions dual to the Coulomb branch along a certain set of geodesics and, for the resulting PP–wave metrics, we examine the effect of beta-deformations on the giant graviton states. We find that giant gravitons exist only up to a critical value of the sigma-deformation parameter, are not degenerate in energy with the point graviton, and remain perturbatively stable. Finally, we probe the sigma-deformed multicenter solutions by examining the static heavy-quark potential by means of Wilson loops. We find situations that give rise to complete screening as well as linear confinement, with the latter arising is an intriguing way reminiscent of phase transitions in statistical systems. ",0,0
"Motivated by the work of Salvetti and Settepanella we introduce certain total orderings of the faces of any shellable regular CW-complex (called `shelling-type orderings') that can be used to explicitly construct maximum acyclic matchings of the poset of cells of the given complex. Building on an application of this method to the classical zonotope shellings we describe a class of maximum acyclic matchings for the Salvetti complex of a linear complexified arrangement. To do this, we introduce and study a new combinatorial stratification of the Salvetti complex. For the obtained acyclic matchings we give an explicit description of the critical cells that depends only on the chosen linear extension of the poset of regions. It is always possible to choose the linear extension so that the critical cells can be explicitly constructed from the chambers of the arrangement via the bijection to no-broken-circuit sets defined by Jewell and Orlik. Our method can be generalized to arbitraty oriented matroids. ",0,0
"We present the results of our investigation of the intermediate-age star cluster BS 90, located in the vicinity of the HII region N 66 in the SMC, observed with HST/ACS. The high-resolution data provide a unique opportunity for a very detailed photometric study performed on one of the rare intermediate-age rich SMC clusters. The complete set of observations is centered on the association NGC 346 and contains almost 100,000 stars down to V28 mag. In this study we focus on the northern part of the region, which covers almost the whole stellar content of BS 90. We construct its stellar surface density profile and derive structural parameters. Isochrone fits on the CMD of the cluster results in an age of about 4.5 Gyr. The luminosity function is constructed and the present-day mass function of BS 90 has been obtained using the mass-luminosity relation, derived from the isochrone models. We found a slope between -1.30 and -0.95, comparable or somewhat shallower than a typical Salpeter IMF. Examination of the radial dependence of the mass function shows a steeper slope at larger radial distances, indicating mass segregation in the cluster. The derived half-mass relaxation time of 0.95 Gyr suggests that the cluster is mass segregated due to its dynamical evolution. From the isochrone model fits we derive a metallicity for BS 90 of [Fe/H]=-0.72, which adds an important point to the age-metallicity relation of the SMC. We discuss our findings on this relation in comparison to other SMC clusters. ",0,0
"We study the single transverse-spin asymmetry for dijet production in hadronic collisions in both the collinear QCD factorization approach and the Brodsky-Hwang-Schmidt model. We show that a nonvanishing asymmetry is generated by both initial-state and final-state interactions, and that the final-state interactions dominate. We find that in the leading kinematic region where the transverse momentum imbalance of the two jets, q_⊥= P_1⊥+P_2⊥, is much less than the momentum of either jet, the contribution from the lowest non-trivial perturbative order to both the spin-averaged and the spin-dependent dijet cross sections can be factorized into a hard part that is a function only of the averaged jet momentum P_⊥= (P_1⊥-P_2⊥)/2, and perturbatively generated transverse momentum dependent (TMD) parton distributions. We show that the spin asymmetry at this non-trivial perturbative order can be described by the TMD parton distributions defined in either semi-inclusive DIS or the Drell-Yan process. We derive the same hard parts from both the collinear factorization approach and in the context of the Brodsky-Hwang-Schmidt model, verifying that they are not sensitive to details of the factorized long distance physics.

"We study 7 Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs), detected both by the BATSE instrument, on-board the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, and by the Wide Field Camera (WFC), on-board BeppoSAX. These bursts have measured spectroscopic redshifts and are a sizeable fraction of the bursts defining the correlation between the peak energy E_peak (i.e. the peak of the vFv spectrum) and the total prompt isotropic energy E_iso (the so called 'Amati' relation). Recent theoretical interpretations of this correlation assume that black-body emission dominates the time resolved spectra of GRBs, even if, in the time integrated spectrum, its presence may be hidden by the change of its temperature and by the dilution of a possible non-thermal power law component. We perform a time resolved spectral analysis, and show that the sum of a power-law and a black-body gives acceptable fits to the time dependent spectra within the BATSE energy range, but overpredicts the flux in the WFC X-ray range. Moreover, a fit with a cutoff power-law plus a black-body is consistent with the WFC data, but the black-body component contributes a negligible fraction of the total flux. On the contrary, we find that fitting the spectra with a Band model or a simple cutoff power-law model yields an X-ray flux and spectral slope which well matches the WFC spectra. ",0,0
"Thermal inertia determines the temperature distribution over the surface of an asteroid and therefore governs the magnitude the Yarkovsky effect. The latter causes gradual drifting of the orbits of km-sized asteroids and plays an important role in the delivery of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) from the main belt and in the dynamical spreading of asteroid families. At present, very little is known about the thermal inertia of asteroids in the km size range. Here we show that the average thermal inertia of a sample of NEAs in the km-size range is 200 ± 40 J m#8722;2 s#8722;0.5 K#8722;1. Furthermore, we identify a trend of increasing thermal inertia with decreasing asteroid diameter, D. This indicates that the dependence of the drift rate of the orbital semimajor axis on the size of asteroids due to the Yarkovsky effect is a more complex function than the generally adopted D^(#8722;1) dependence, and that the size distribution of objects injected by Yarkovsky-driven orbital mobility into the NEA source regions is less skewed to smaller sizes than generally assumed. We discuss how this fact may help to explain the small difference in the slope of the size distribution of km-sized NEAs and main-belt asteroids. ",0,0
"Covariant density functional theory, which has so far been applied only within the framework of static and time dependent mean field theory is extended to include Particle-Vibration Coupling (PVC) in a consistent way. Starting from a conventional energy functional we calculate the low-lying collective vibrations in Relativistic Random Phase Approximation (RRPA) and construct an energy dependent self-energy for the Dyson equation. The resulting Bethe-Salpeter equation in the particle-hole (ph) channel is solved in the Time Blocking Approximation (TBA). No additional parameters are used and double counting is avoided by a proper subtraction method. The same energy functional, i.e. the same set of coupling constants, generates the Dirac-Hartree single-particle spectrum, the static part of the residual ph-interaction and the particle-phonon coupling vertices. Therefore a fully consistent description of nuclear excited states is developed. This method is applied for an investigation of damping phenomena in the spherical nuclei with closed shells ^208Pb and ^132Sn. Since the phonon coupling terms enrich the RRPA spectrum with a multitude of ph⊗phonon components a noticeable fragmentation of the giant resonances is found, which is in full agreement with experimental data and with results of the semi-phenomenological non-relativistic approach.

"There are two promising scenarios that explain the ankle, which is a dip in the spectrum of cosmic rays at ∼ 10^19 eV. A scenario interprets the ankle as the transition from Galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays (ankle-transition scenario), while the other is that the dip caused by pair production on the cosmic microwave background radiation (proton-dip scenario). In this paper, we consider whether cosmogenic neutrinos can be a clue to judge which scenario is favored. We calculated the fluxes of cosmogenic neutrinos following these scenarios with plausible physical parameter sets, and found several important features as follows. First of all, the neutrino flux at ∼ 10^20 eV becomes much higher in the ankle-transition scenario as long as the maximum energy of the cosmic rays at sources is sufficiently high. On the other hand, the neutrino spectrum has a characteristic peak at ∼ 10^16 eV in the proton-dip scenario on the condition that extragalactic protons significantly contribute to the observed cosmic rays down to 10^17 eV. Thus, we conclude cosmogenic neutrinos should give us a clue to judge which scenario is favored, unless these features are masked by the neutrino background coming from possible, powerful neutrino sources such as AGNs and GRBs. We also found an interesting feature that the neutrino flux at ∼ 10^18 eV depends only on the cosmological evolution of the cosmic ray sources. That means cosmogenic neutrinos with the energy bring us information on the cosmological evolution of the sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. Finally, we compare the fluxes of cosmogenic neutrinos with the expected sensitivity curves of several neutrino detectors, and conclude the detection of cosmogenic neutrinos in the near future is promising.

"Hydrogen-burning is the root cause of the star-to-star abundance variations of light nuclei in Galactic globular clusters (GC).

We perform nucleosynthesis calculations at constant temperature, adopting realistic initial abundances for the proto-cluster gas. We use a detailed nuclear reaction network and state-of-the-art nuclear reaction rates. Although simplistic, our analysis provides original results and new constraints on the self-enrichment scenario for GCs.

"The Grassmann manifold G_n,p(L) is the set of all p-dimensional planes (through the origin) in the n-dimensional Euclidean space L^n, where L is either R or C. This paper considers an unequal dimensional quantization in which a source in G_n,p(L) is quantized through a code in G_n,q(L), where p and q are not necessarily the same. It is different from most works in literature where p≡q. The analysis for unequal dimensional quantization is based on the volume of a metric ball in G_n,p(L) whose center is in G_n,q(L). Our chief result is a closed-form formula for the volume of a metric ball when the radius is sufficiently small. This volume formula holds for Grassmann manifolds with arbitrary n, p, q and L, while previous results pertained only to some special cases. Based on this volume formula, several bounds are derived for the rate distortion tradeoff assuming the quantization rate is sufficiently high. The lower and upper bounds on the distortion rate function are asymptotically identical, and so precisely quantify the asymptotic rate distortion tradeoff. We also show that random codes are asymptotically optimal in the sense that they achieve the minimum achievable distortion with probability one as n and the code rate approach infinity linearly. Finally, we discuss some applications of the derived results to communication theory. A geometric interpretation in the Grassmann manifold is developed for capacity calculation of additive white Gaussian noise channel. Further, the derived distortion rate function is beneficial to characterizing the effect of beamforming matrix selection in multi-antenna communications. ",0,0
"Any stretching of Ringel's non-Pappus pseudoline arrangement when projected into the Euclidean plane, implicitly contains a particular arrangement of nine triangles. This arrangement has a complex constraint involving the sines of its angles. These constraints cannot be satisfied by any projection of the initial arrangement. This is sufficient to prove Pappus's theorem. The derivation of the constraint is via systems of inequalities arising from the polar coordinates of the lines. These systems are linear in r for any given theta, and their solubility can be analysed in terms of the signs of determinants. The evaluation of the determinants is via a normal form for sums of products of sines, giving a powerful system of trigonometric identities. The particular result is generalized to arrangements derived from three edge connected totally cyclic directed graphs, conjectured to be sufficient for a complete analysis of angle constraining arrangements of lines, and thus a full response to Ringel's slope conjecture. These methods are generally applicable to the realizability problem for rank 3 oriented matroids. ",0,0
"Using the formalism of Grothendieck's derivators, we construct `the universal localizing invariant of dg categories'. By this, we mean a morphism U_l from the pointed derivator associated with the Morita homotopy theory of dg categories to a triangulated strong derivator M^loc such that U_l commutes with filtered homotopy colimits, preserves the point, sends each exact sequence of dg categories to a triangle and is universal for these properties. Similary, we construct the `the universal additive invariant of dg categories', i.e. the universal morphism of derivators U_a to a strong triangulated derivator M^add which satisfies the first two properties but the third one only for split exact sequences. We prove that Waldhausen K-theory appears as a mapping space in the target of the universal additive invariant. This is the first conceptual characterization of Quillen-Waldhausen's K-theory since its definition in the early 70's. As an application we obtain for free the higher Chern characters from K-theory to cyclic homology. ",0,0
"HET Optical spectra covering the evolution from about 6 days before to about 5 weeks after maximum light and the ROTSE-IIIb unfiltered light curve of the 'Branch-normal' Type Ia Supernova SN 2005hj are presented. The host galaxy shows HII region lines at redshift of z=0.0574, which puts the peak unfiltered absolute magnitude at a somewhat over-luminous -19.6. The spectra show weak and narrow SiII lines, and for a period of at least 10 days beginning around maximum light these profiles do not change in width or depth and they indicate a constant expansion velocity of10,600 km/s. We analyzed the observations based on detailed radiation dynamical models in the literature. Whereas delayed detonation and deflagration models have been used to explain the majority of SNe Ia, they do not predict a long velocity plateau in the SiII minimum with an unvarying line profile. Pulsating delayed detonations and merger scenarios form shell-like density structures with properties mostly related to the mass of the shell, M_shell, and we discuss how these models may explain the observed SiII line evolution; however, these models are based on spherical calculations and other possibilities may exist. SN 2005hj is consistent with respect to the onset, duration, and velocity of the plateau, the peak luminosity and, within the uncertainties, with the intrinsic colors for models with M_shell=0.2 M_sun. Our analysis suggests a distinct class of events hidden within the Branch-normal SNe Ia. If the predicted relations between observables are confirmed, they may provide a way to separate these two groups. We discuss the implications of two distinct progenitor classes on cosmological studies employing SNe Ia, including possible differences in the peak luminosity to light curve width relation. ",0,0
"The corrections to g-mode frequencies caused by the presence of a central magnetic field and rotation of the Sun are calculated. The calculations are carried out in the simple one dimensional magnetohydrodynamical model using the approximations which allow one to find the purely analytical spectra of magneto-gravity waves beyond the scope of the JWKB approximation and avoid in a small background magnetic field the appearance of the cusp resonance which locks a wave within the radiative zone. These analytic results are compared with the satellite observations of the g-mode frequency shifts which are of the order one per cent as given in the GOLF experiment at the SoHO board. The main contribution turns out to be the magnetic frequency shift in the strong magnetic field which obeys the used approximations. In particular, the fixed magnetic field strength 700 KG results in the mentioned value of the frequency shift for the g-mode of the radial order n=-10. The rotational shift due to the Coriolis force appears to be small and does not exceed a fracton of per cent, α_Ω< 0.003. ",0,0

"The dynamics of linear perturbations is studied in magnetized plasma shear flows with a constant shearing rate and with gravity-induced stratification. The general set of linearized equations is derived and the two-dimensional case is considered in detail. The Boussinesq approximation is used in order to examine relatively small-scale perturbations of low-frequency modes: Gravito-Alfven waves (GAW) and Entropy Mode (EM) perturbations. It is shown that for flows with arbitrary shearing rate there exists a finite time interval of non-adiabatic evolution of the perturbations. The non-adiabatic behavior manifests itself in a twofold way, viz. by the over-reflection of the GAWs and by the generation of GAWs from EM perturbations. It is shown that these phenomena act as efficient transformers of the equilibrium flow energy into the energy of the perturbations for moderate and high shearing rate solar plasma flows. Efficient generation of GAW by EM takes place for shearing rates about an order of magnitude smaller than necessary for development of a shear instability. The latter fact could have important consequences for the problem of angular momentum redistribution within the Sun and solar-type stars. ",0,0
"We use strongly coupled lattice QED with two flavors of massless staggered fermions to model the physics of pions in two-flavor massless QCD. Our model has the right chiral symmetries and can be studied efficiently with cluster algorithms. In particular we can tune the strength of the QCD anomaly and thus study its effects on the chiral phase transition. Our study confirms the widely accepted view point that the chiral phase transition is first order in the absence of the anomaly. Turning on the anomaly weakens the transition and turns it second order at a critical anomaly strength. The anomaly strength at the tricritical point is characterized using r = (M_η'-M_π)/ρ_η' where M_η', M_π are the screening masses of the anomalous and regular pions and ρ_η' is the mass-scale that governs the low energy fluctuations of the anomalous symmetry. We estimate that r ∼ 7 in our model. This suggests that a strong anomaly at the two-flavor QCD chiral phase transition is necessary to wash out the first order transition. ",0,0

"We study a modified version of a model previously proposed by Jackson and Wolinsky to account for communicating information and allocating goods in socioeconomic networks. In the model, the utility function of each node is given by a weighted sum of contributions from all accessible nodes. The weights, parameterized by the variable δ, decrease with distance. We introduce a growth mechanism where new nodes attach to the existing network preferentially by utility. By increasing δ, the network structure evolves from a power-law to an exponential degree distribution, passing through a regime characterised by shorter average path length, lower degree assortativity and higher central point dominance. In the second part of the paper we compare different network structures in terms of the average utility received by each node. We show that power-law networks provide higher average utility than Poisson random networks. This provides a possible justification for the ubiquitousness of scale-free networks in the real world.

"'Hot Jupiter' extrasolar planets are expected to be tidally locked because they are close (<0.05 astronomical units, where 1 AU is the average Sun-Earth distance) to their parent stars, resulting in permanent daysides and nightsides. By observing systems where the planet and star periodically eclipse each other, several groups have been able to estimate the temperatures of the daysides of these planets. A key question is whether the atmosphere is able to transport the energy incident upon the dayside to the nightside, which will determine the temperature at different points on the planet's surface. Here we report observations of HD 189733, the closest of these eclipsing planetary systems, over half an orbital period, from which we can construct a 'map' of the distribution of temperatures. We detected the increase in brightness as the dayside of the planet rotated into view. We estimate a minimum brightness temperature of 973 +/- 33 K and a maximum brightness temperature of 1212 +/- 11 K at a wavelength of 8 microns, indicating that energy from the irradiated dayside is efficiently redistributed throughout the atmosphere, in contrast to a recent claim for another hot Jupiter. Our data indicate that the peak hemisphere-integrated brightness occurs 16±6 degrees before opposition, corresponding to a hot spot shifted east of the substellar point. The secondary eclipse (when the planet moves behind the star) occurs 120 +/- 24 s later than predicted, which may indicate a slightly eccentric orbit. ",0,0
"We analyse high-time-resolution spectroscopy of the AM CVn stars HP Librae and V803 Centauri, taken with the New Technology Telescope (NTT) and the Very Large Telescope (VLT) of the European Southern Observatory, Chile.We present evidence that the literature value for V803 Cen's orbital period is incorrect, based on an observed `S-wave' in the binary's spectrogram. We measure a spectroscopic period P=1596.4+/-1.2s of the S-wave feature, which is significantly shorter than the 1611-second periods found in previous photometric studies. We conclude that the latter period likely represents a `superhump'. If one assumes that our S-wave period is the orbital period, V803 Cen's mass ratio can be expected to be much less extreme than previously thought, at q 0.07 rather than q 0.016. This relaxes the constraints on the masses of the components considerably: the donor star does then not need to be fully degenerate, and the mass of the accreting white dwarf no longer has to be very close to the Chandrasekhar limit.For HP Lib, we similarly measure a spectroscopic period P=1102.8+/-0.2s. This supports the identification of HP Lib's photometric periods found in the literature, and the constraints upon the masses derived from them. ",0,0
"The scenario that some first-order phase transitions may have taken place in the early Universe offers us one of the most intriguing and fascinating questions in cosmology. Indeed, the role played by the latent 'heat' or energy released in the phase transition is highly nontrivial and may lead to some surprising, important results. In this paper, we take the wisdom that the cosmological QCD phase transition, which happened at a time between 10^(-5) sec and 10^(-4) sec or at the temperature of about 150 MeV and accounts for confinement of quarks and gluons to within hadrons, would be of first order. To get the essence out of the scenario, it is sufficient to approximate the true QCD vacuum as one of degenerate theta-vacua and when necessary we try to model it effectively via a complex scalar field with spontaneous symmetry breaking. We examine how and when 'pasted' or 'patched' domain walls are formed, how long such walls evolve in the long run, and we believe that the significant portion of dark matter could be accounted for in terms of such domain-wall structure and its remnants. Of course, the cosmological QCD phase transition happened in the way such that the false vacua associated with baryons and many other color-singlet objects did not disappear (that is, using the bag-model language, there are bags of radius 1.0 fermi for the baryons) - but the amount of the energy remained in the false vacua is negligible. The latent energy released due to the conversion of the false vacua to the true vacua, in the form of 'pasted' or 'patched' domain walls in the short run and their numerous evolved objects, should make the concept of the 'radiation-dominated' epoch, or of the 'matter-dominated' epoch to be re-examined.

"In the framework of the effective field theory method, we use the experimental data and the perturbative unitarity bounds to determine the values and uncertainty of all the 11 chiral coefficients (_i, i=0, ..., 10) of the standard electroweak chiral Lagrangian. Up to linear terms in _i, we provide the one-loop renormalization group equations of all the chiral coefficients, which are calculated in the Feynman-'t Hooft gauge using the modified minimal subtraction scheme. With the improved renormalization group equations to sum over the logarithmic corrections, we analyze the current experimental uncertainty of oblique correction parameters, S(Λ) and T(Λ). We find that, due to the large uncertainty in the triple gauge-boson coupling measurements, the parameter space of positive S(Λ) for Λ > 1 TeV is still allowed by the current experimental data. T(Λ) tends to increase with Λ even in the presence of the operators that contribute to the triple and quartic gauge-boson couplings. ",0,0
"We report the results of our first-principles investigation on the interaction of the nucleobases adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), thymine (T), and uracil (U) with graphene, carried out within the density functional theory framework, with additional calculations utilizing Hartree–Fock plus second-order Moeller-Plesset perturbation theory. The calculated binding energy of the nucleobases shows the following hierarchy: G > TCA > U, with the equilibrium configuration being very similar for all five of them. Our results clearly demonstrate that the nucleobases exhibit significantly different interaction strengths when physisorbed on graphene. The stabilizing factor in the interaction between the base molecule and graphene sheet is dominated by the molecular polarizability that allows a weakly attractive dispersion force to be induced between them. The present study represents a significant step towards a first-principles understanding of how the base sequence of DNA can affect its interaction with carbon nanotubes, as observed experimentally.

"In this paper we apply new geometric and combinatorial methods to the study of phylogenetic mixtures. The focus of the geometric approach is to describe the geometry of phylogenetic mixture distributions for the two state random cluster model, which is a generalization of the two state symmetric (CFN) model. In particular, we show that the set of mixture distributions forms a convex polytope and we calculate its dimension; corollaries include a simple criterion for when a mixture of branch lengths on the star tree can mimic the site pattern frequency vector of a resolved quartet tree. Furthermore, by computing volumes of polytopes we can clarify how “common” non-identifiable mixtures are under the CFN model. We also present a new combinatorial result which extends any identifiability result for a specific pair of trees of size six to arbitrary pairs of trees. Next we present a positive result showing identifiability of rates-across-sites models. Finally, we answer a question raised in a previous paper concerning “mixed branch repulsion” on trees larger than quartet trees under the CFN model. ",0,0
"The HERMES experiment has measured the transverse polarization of Lambda and Lambda-bar hyperons produced inclusively in quasireal photoproduction at a positron beam energy of 27.6 GeV. The transverse polarization of the Lambda hyperon is found to be positive while the observed Lambda-bar polarization is compatible with zero. The transverse polarization values averaged over the kinematic acceptance of HERMES are 0.078 +/- 0.006(stat) +/- 0.012(syst) and -0.025 +/- 0.015(stat) +/- 0.018(syst) for Lambda and Lambda-bar hyperons, respectively. The dependences of Lambda and Lambda-bar polarizations on the fraction ζ of the beam's light-cone momentum carried by the hyperon and on the hyperon's transverse momentum p_T were investigated. The measured Lambda polarization rises linearly with p_T and exhibits a different behavior for low and high values of ζ, which approximately correspond to the backward and forward regions in the center-of-mass frame of the γ^*N reaction.

"The nanoscopic structure and the stationary propagation velocity of (1+1)-dimensional solid-on-solid interfaces in an Ising lattice-gas model, which are driven far from equilibrium by an applied force, such as a magnetic field or a difference in (electro)chemical potential, are studied by an analytic nonlinear-response approximation together with kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. Here we consider the case that the system is coupled to a two-dimensional phonon bath. In the resulting dynamic, transitions that conserve the system energy are forbidden, and the effects of the applied force and the interaction energies do not factorize (a so-called hard dynamic). In full agreement with previous general theoretical results we find that the local interface width changes dramatically with the applied force. However, in contrast with other hard dynamics, this change is nonmonotonic in the driving force. However, significant differences between theory and simulation are found near two special values of the driving force, where certain transitions allowed by the solid-on-solid model become forbidden by the phonon-assisted dynamic. Our results represent a significant step toward providing a solid physical foundation for kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. ",0,0
"We use first-principles density functional theory-based calculations to investigate structural instabilities in the high symmetry cubic perovskite structure of rare-earth (R = La, Y, Lu) and Bi-based biferroic chromites, focusing on Γ and R point phonons of states with para-, ferro-, and antiferromagnetic ordering. We find that (a) the structure with G-type antiferromagnetic ordering is most stable, (b) the most dominant structural instabilities in these oxides are the ones associated with rotations of oxygen octahedra, and (c) structural instabilities involving changes in Cr-O-Cr bond angle depend sensitively on the changes in magnetic ordering. The dependence of structural instabilities on magnetic ordering can be understood in terms of how super-exchange interactions depend on the Cr-O-Cr bond angles and Cr-O bond lengths. We demonstrate how adequate buckling of Cr-O-Cr chains can favour ferromagnetism. Born effective charges (BEC) calculated using the Berry phase expression are found to be anomalously large for the A-cations, indicating their chemical relevance to ferroelectric distortions. ",0,0
"We perform self-consistent quantum transport calculations in open quantum dots taking into account the effect of electron interaction. We demonstrative that in the regime of the ultralow temperatures 2π k_BT≲Δ (Δ being the mean level spacing), the electron interaction strongly affects the conductance oscillations and their statistics leading to a drastic deviation from the corresponding predictions for noninteracting electrons. In particular, it causes smearing of conductance oscillations, which is similar to the effect of temperature or inelastic scattering. For 2π k_BT≳Δ the influence of electron interaction on the conductance becomes strongly diminished. Our calculations (that are free from phenomenological parameters of the theory) are in good quantitative agreement with the observed ultralow temperature statistics (Huibers et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 81, 1917 (1998)). Our findings question a conventional interpretation of the ultralow temperature saturation of the coherence time in open dots which is based on the noninteracting theories where the electron interaction is neglected and the agrement with the experiment is achieved by introducing additional phenomenological channels of dephasing.

"We investigate the effects of relatively rapid variations of the boundaries of an overmoded cavity on the stochastic properties of its interior acoustic or electromagnetic field. For quasi-static variations, this field can be represented as an ideal incoherent and statistically homogeneous isotropic random scalar or vector field, respectively. A physical model is constructed showing that the field dynamics can be characterized as a generalized diffusion process. The Langevin–Itô and Fokker–Planck equations are derived and their associated statistics and distributions for the complex analytic field, its magnitude and energy density are computed. The energy diffusion parameter is found to be proportional to the square of the ratio of the standard deviation of the source field to the characteristic time constant of the dynamic process, but is independent of the initial energy density, to first order. The energy drift vanishes in the asymptotic limit. The time-energy probability distribution is in general not separable, as a result of nonstationarity. A general solution of the Fokker–Planck equation is obtained in integral form, together with explicit closed-form solutions for several asymptotic cases. The findings extend known results on statistics and distributions of quasi-stationary ideal random fields (pure diffusions), which are retrieved as special cases. ",0,0
"Thermally stimulated luminescence (TSL) and conductivity (TSC) are considered using the classical insulator model that assumes one kind of the active trap, one kind of inactive deep trap, and one kind of the recombination center. Kinetic equations describing the model are solved numerically without and with the use of the quasiequilibrium (QE) approximation. The QE state parameter qI,, the relative recombination probability g, and a new parameter called quasi-stationary (QS) state parameter q*=qIg are used for the analysis of the TSL and TSC. The TSL and TSC curves and the temperature dependences of qI, q*, g, the recombination lifetime, and the occupancies of active traps and recombination centers are numerically calculated for five sets of kinetic parameters and different heating rates. These calculation results show that: (1) the upper limit of the heating rate for presence of the QS state appears at higher heating rate than that for the QE state when the retrapping process is present, and (2) the TSL (TSC) curves in the QS state have the properties similar to those for the TSL (TSC) curves in the QE state. Approximate formulas for calculation of the parameters qI and q* in the initial range of the TSL and TSC curves are derived and used in the heating-rate methods, proposed in this work, for determination of those parameters from the calculated TSL curves.

"The common wisdom that the phonon mechanism of electron pairing in the weak-coupling Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superconductors leads to conventional s-wave Cooper pairs is revised. An inevitable anisotropy of sound velocity in crystals makes the phonon-mediated attraction of electrons non-local in space providing unconventional Cooper pairs with a nonzero orbital momentum in a wide range of electron densities. As a result of this anisotropy quasi-two dimensional charge carriers undergo a quantum phase transition from an unconventional d-wave superconducting state to a conventional s-wave superconductor with more carriers per unit cell. In the opposite strong-coupling regime rotational symmetry breaking appears as a result of a reduced Coulomb repulsion between unconventional bipolarons dismissing thereby some constraints on unconventional pairing in the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) limit. The conventional phonons, and not superexchange, are shown to be responsible for the d-wave symmetry of cuprate superconductors, where the on-site Coulomb repulsion is large. ",0,0
"A significant fraction of nearby elliptical galaxies are known to have high density gas disks in their circumnuclear (CN) region (0.1 to a few kpc). Yet, ellipticals, especially luminous ones, show little signs of recent star formation (SF). To investigate the possible cause of the dearth of SF in these systems, we study the gravitational stability of CN gas disks embedded within the potentials of both the stellar bulge and the central massive black hole (BH) in ellipticals. We find that CN disks in higher mass galaxies are generally more stable than those in lower mass galaxies, because higher mass galaxies tend to have more massive BHs and more centrally concentrated stellar density profiles. We also consider the case in which the central stellar density profile has a core, which is often observed for ellipticals whose total stellar mass is higher than about 10^11 Msun. Such a cored stellar density profile leads to more unstable CN disks than the power-law density profile characteristic of less massive galaxies. However, the more massive BHs in high-mass galaxies act to stabilize the CN disk. Our results demonstrate that the gravitational potentials of both the central BH and the stellar component should be taken into account when studying the properties of CN disks, as their stability is sensitive to both the BH mass and the stellar density profile. Our results could explain the observed trend that less luminous ellipticals have a greater tendency to exhibit ongoing SF than giant ellipticals. ",0,0

"We investigate the segregation of the extragalactic population via colour criteria to produce an efficient and inexpensive methodology to select specific source populations as a function of far-infrared flux. Combining galaxy evolution scenarios and a detailed spectral library of galaxies, we produce simulated catalogues incorporating segregation of the extragalactic population into component types (Normal, star-forming, AGN) via color cuts. As a practical application we apply our criteria to the deepest survey to be undertaken in the far-infrared with the AKARI (formerly ASTRO-F) satellite. Using the far-infrared wavebands of the Far-Infrared Surveyor (FIS, one of the focal-plane instruments on AKARI) we successfully segregate the normal, starburst and ULIRG populations. We also show that with additional MIR imaging from AKARI's Infrared Camera (IRC), significant contamination and/or degeneracy can be further decreased and show a particular example of the separation of cool normal galaxies and cold ULIRG sources. We conclude that our criteria provide an efficient means of selecting source populations (including rare luminous objects) and produce colour-segregated source counts without the requirement of time intensive ground-based follow up to differentiate between the general galaxy population.

"Various methods of treating outer boundaries in numerical relativity are compared using a simple test problem: a Schwarzschild black hole with an outgoing gravitational wave perturbation. Numerical solutions computed using different boundary treatments are compared to a `reference' numerical solution obtained by placing the outer boundary at a very large radius. For each boundary treatment, the full solutions including constraint violations and extracted gravitational waves are compared to those of the reference solution, thereby assessing the reflections caused by the artificial boundary. These tests use a first-order generalized harmonic formulation of the Einstein equations. Constraint-preserving boundary conditions for this system are reviewed, and an improved boundary condition on the gauge degrees of freedom is presented. Alternate boundary conditions evaluated here include freezing the incoming characteristic fields, Sommerfeld boundary conditions, and the constraint-preserving boundary conditions of Kreiss and Winicour. Rather different approaches to boundary treatments, such as sponge layers and spatial compactification, are also tested. Overall the best treatment found here combines boundary conditions that preserve the constraints, freeze the Newman-Penrose scalar Psi_0, and control gauge reflections. ",0,0
"From an experimental point of view, room temperature ferroelectricity in BiFeO3 is raising many questions. Electric measurements made a long time ago on solid-solutions of BiFeO3 with Pb(Ti,Zr)O3 indicate that a spontaneous electric polarization exists in BiFeO3 below the Curie temperature TC=1143K. Yet in most reported works, the synthesised samples are too conductive at room temperature to get a clear polarization loop in the bulk without any effects of extrinsic physical or chemical parameters. Surprisingly, up to now there has been no report of a P(E) (polarization versus electric field) loop at room temperature on single crystals of BiFeO3. We describe here our procedure to synthesize ceramics and to grow good quality sizeable single crystals by a flux method. We demonstrate that BiFeO3 is indeed ferroelectric at room-temperature through evidence by Piezoresponse Force Microscopy and P(E) loops. The polarization is found to be large, around 60 microC/cm2, a value that has only been reached in thin films. Magnetic measurements using a SQUID magnetometer and Mossbauer spectroscopy are also presented. The latter confirms the results of NMR measurements concerning the anisotropy of the hyperfine field attributed to the magnetic cycloidal structure. ",0,0
"The GLAST Burst Monitor (GBM) will augment the capabilities of GLAST for the detection of cosmic gamma-ray bursts by extending the energy range (20 MeV to > 300 GeV) of the Large Area Telescope (LAT) towards lower energies by 2 BGO-detectors (150 keV to 30 MeV) and 12 NaI(Tl) detectors (10 keV to 1 MeV).

All flight and spare detectors were irradiated with calibrated radioactive sources in the laboratory (from 14 keV to 4.43 MeV). The energy/channel-relations, the dependences of energy resolution and effective areas on the energy and the angular responses were measured.

"Theoretical analysis of interplay between the condensates <q̅q> and <qq> in vacuum is generally made by relativistic effective potentials in the mean field approximation in 2D, 3D and 4D models with two flavor and N_c color massless fermions. It is found that in ground states of these models, interplay between the two condensates mainly depend on the ratio G_S/H_S for 2D and 4D case or G_S/H_P for 3D case, where G_S, H_S and H_P are respectively the coupling constants in a scalar (q̅q), a scalar (qq) and a pseudoscalar (qq) channel. In ground states of all the models, only pure <q̅q> condensates could exist if G_S/H_S or G_S/H_P is bigger than the critical value 2/N_c, the ratio of the color numbers of the fermions entering into the condensates <qq> and <q̅q>. As G_S/H_S or G_S/H_P decreases to the region below 2/N_c, differences of the models will manifest themselves. Depending on different models, and also on N_c in 3D model, one will have or have no the coexistence phase of the two condensates, besides the pure <qq> condensate phase. The G_S-H_S (or G_S-H_P) phase diagrams in these models are given. The results also implicate a real constraint on two-flavor QCD-analogous NJL model. ",0,0
"We consider a system of d non-linear stochastic heat equations in spatial dimension 1 driven by d-dimensional space-time white noise. The non-linearities appear both as additive drift terms and as multipliers of the noise. Using techniques of Malliavin calculus, we establish upper and lower bounds on the one-point density of the solution u(t,x), and upper bounds of Gaussian-type on the two-point density of (u(s,y),u(t,x)). In particular, this estimate quantifies how this density degenerates as (s,y) converges to (t,x). From these results, we deduce upper and lower bounds on hitting probabilities of the process u(t,x)_t ∈ℝ_+, x ∈[0,1], in terms of respectively Hausdorff measure and Newtonian capacity. These estimates make it possible to show that points are polar when d >6 and are not polar when d<6. We also show that the Hausdorff dimension of the range of the process is 6 when d>6, and give analogous results for the processes t ↦u(t,x) and x ↦u(t,x). Finally, we obtain the values of the Hausdorff dimensions of the level sets of these processes. ",0,0
"We provide a grid of PHOENIX spectra of red giant and supergiant stars, that extend through optical and near-IR wavelengths. For the first time, models are also provided with modified surface abundances of C, N and O, as a step towards accounting for the changes known to occur due to convective dredge-up (and to be enhanced in the case of rotation). The aims are (i) to assess how well current models reproduce observed spectra, (ii) to quantify the effects of the abundance changes on the spectra, and (iii) to determine how these changes affect estimates of fundamental stellar parameters.Observed giant star spectra can be fitted very well at solar metallicity down to about 3400K. Modified surface abundances are preferred in only a minority of cases for luminosity class II, possibly indicating mixing in excess of standard first dredge-up.Supergiant stars show a larger variety of near-IR spectra, and good fits are currently obtained for about one third of the observations only. Modified surface abundances help reproducing strong CN bands, but do not suffice to resolve all the difficulties. The effect of the abundance changes on the estimated Teff depends on the wavelength range of observation and can amount several 100K. Reasons for the remaining discrepancies are discussed. ",0,0
"Spatiotemporal correlations of the two-dimensional spring-block (Burridge-Knopoff) model of earthquakes are extensively studied by means of numerical computer simulations. The model is found to exhibit either “subcritical” or “supercritical” behavior, depending on the values of the model parameters. Transition between these regimes is either continuous or discontinuous. Seismic events in the “subcritical” regime and those in the “supercritical” regime at larger magnitudes exhibit universal scaling properties. In the “supercritical” regime, eminent spatiotemporal correlations, e.g., remarkable growth of seismic activity preceding the mainshock, arise in earthquake occurrence, whereas such spatiotemporal correlations are significantly suppressed in the “subcritical” regime. Seismic activity is generically suppressed just before the mainshock in a close vicinity of the epicenter of the upcoming event while it remains to be active in the surroundings (the Mogi doughnut). It is also observed that, before and after the mainshock, the apparent B-value of the magnitude distribution decreases or increases in the “supercritical” or “subcritical” regimes, respectively. Such distinct precursory phenomena may open a way to the prediction of the upcoming large event. ",0,0

"We present an examination of the kinematics and stellar populations of a sample of 3 Brightest Group Galaxies (BGGs) and 3 Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs) in X-ray groups and clusters. We have obtained high signal-to-noise Gemini/GMOS (Gemini South Multi-Object Spectrograph) long-slit spectra of these galaxies and use Lick indices to determine ages, metallicities and alpha-element abundance ratios out to at least their effective radii. We find that the BGGs and BCGs have very uniform masses, central ages and central metallicities. Examining the radial dependence of their stellar populations, we find no significant velocity dispersion, age, or alpha-enhancement gradients. However, we find a wide range of metallicity gradients, suggesting a variety of formation mechanisms. The range of metallicity gradients observed is surprising given the homogeneous environment these galaxies probe and their uniform central stellar populations. However, our results are inconsistent with any single model of galaxy formation and emphasize the need for more theoretical understanding of both the origins of metallicity gradients and galaxy formation itself. We postulate two possible physical causes for the different formation mechanisms. ",0,0
"This thesis provides a partial answer to a question posed by Greg Kuperberg in q-alg/9712003 and again by Justin Roberts as problem 12.18 in 'Problems on invariants of knots and 3-manifolds', math.GT/0406190, essentially: 'Can one describe the category of representations of the quantum group U_q(sl_n) (thought of as a spherical category) via generators and relations?'For each n ≥0, I define a certain tensor category of trivalent graphs, modulo isotopy, and construct a functor from this category onto (a full subcategory of) the category of representations of the quantum group U_q(sl_n). One would like to describe completely the kernel of this functor, by providing generators. The resulting quotient of the diagrammatic category would then be a category equivalent to the representation category of U_q(sl_n).I make significant progress towards this, describing certain generators of the kernel, and some obstructions to further elements. It remains a conjecture that these relations generate the kernel. My results extend those of q-alg/9712003, MR1659228, math.QA/0310143 and math.GT/0506403.The argument is essentially by constructing a diagrammatic version of the forgetful functor coming from the inclusion of U_q(sl_n-1) in U_q(sl_n. We know this functor is faithful, so a diagram is in the kernel for n exactly if its image under the diagrammatic forgetful functor is in the kernel for n-1. This allows us to perform inductive calculations, both establishing families of elements of the kernel, and finding obstructions. ",0,0

"In recent years, the availability of highly pure stable isotopes has made possible the investigation of the dependence of the physical properties of crystals, in particular semiconductors, on their isotopic composition. Following the investigation of the specific heat (C_p, C_v) of monatomic crystals such as diamond, silicon, and germanium, similar investigations have been undertaken for the tetrahedral diatomic systems ZnO and GaN (wurtzite structure), for which the effect of the mass of the cation differs from that of the anion. In this article we present measurements for a semiconductor with rock salt structure, namely lead sulfide. Because of the large difference in the atomic mass of both constituents (M_ Pb= 207.21 and (M_ S=32.06 a.m.u., for the natural isotopic abundance) the effects of varying the cation and that of the anion mass are very different for this canonical semiconductor. We compare the measured temperature dependence of C_p ≈ C_v, and the corresponding derivatives with respect to (M_ Pb and M_ S), with ab initio calculations based on the lattice dynamics obtained from the local density approximation (LDA) electronic band structure. Quantitative deviations between theory and experiment are attributed to the absence of spin-orbit interaction in the ABINIT program used for the electronic band structure calculations. ",0,0
"We present a multiwavelength study of the poor cluster RX J1117.4+0743 ([VMF 98] 097) at z=0.485, based on GMOS/Gemini South g', r' photometry and spectroscopy, and XMM-Newton observations. We examine its nature and surroundings by analyzing the projected galaxy distribution, the galaxy velocity distribution, the weak-lensing mass reconstruction, and the X-ray spectroscopy and imaging. The cluster shows a complex morphology. It is composed by at least two structures along the line-of-sight, with velocity dispersions of 592+-82 km s^-1 and 391+-85 km s^-1 respectively. Other structures are also detected in X-ray, in the galaxy projected number density map, and by weak-lensing. One of these clumps, could be gravitationally bound and associated to the main cluster. The derived temperature and bolometric X-ray luminosity reveal that [VMF 98] 097 behave like a normal cluster, in agreement with Lx-Tx correlation found for both local (z=0) and moderate redshift (z 0.4) clusters. We find that the mass determination inferred from weak-lensing is in average 3 to 4.8 times higher (depending on the model assumed) than the X-ray mass. We have two possible explanations for this discrepancy: i) the cluster is in non-equilibrium, then the deviation of the X-ray estimated mass from the true value can be as high as a factor of two; ii) the intervening mass along the line-of-sight of the cluster is producing an over-estimation of the weak-lensing mass. Based on the analysis presented, we conclude that [VMF 98] 097 is a perturbed cluster with at least two substructures in velocity space and with other nearby structures at projected distances of about 1 h^-1 Mpc. This cluster is an example of a poor cluster caught in the process of accreting sub-structures to become a rich cluster. ",0,0
"There is a growing interest in the cosmologists for theories with negative energy scalar fields and creation, in order to model a repulsive gravity. The classical steady state cosmology proposed by Bondi, Gold and Hoyle in 1948, was the first such theory which used a negative kinetic energy creation field to invoke creation of matter. We emphasize that creation plays very crucial role in cosmology and provides a natural explanation to the various explosive phenomena occurring in local (z<0.1) and extra galactic universe. We exemplify this point of view by considering the resurrected version of this theory - the quasi-steady state theory, which tries to relate creation events directly to the large scale dynamics of the universe and supplies more natural explanations of the observed phenomena. Although the theory predicts a decelerating universe at the present era, it explains successfully the recent SNe Ia observations (which require an accelerating universe in the standard cosmology), as we show in this paper by performing a Bayesian analysis of the data.

"Renormalization group (RG) improved cosmologies based upon a RG trajectory of Quantum Einstein Gravity (QEG) with realistic parameter values are investigated using a system of cosmological evolution equations which allows for an unrestricted energy exchange between the vacuum and the matter sector. It is demonstrated that the scale dependence of the gravitational parameters, the cosmological constant in particular, leads to an entropy production in the matter system. The picture emerges that the Universe started out from a state of vanishing entropy, and that the radiation entropy observed today is essentially due to the coarse graining (RG flow) in the quantum gravity sector which is related to the expansion of the Universe. Furthermore, the RG improved field equations are shown to possess solutions with an epoch of power law inflation immediately after the initial singularity. The inflation is driven by the cosmological constant and ends automatically once the RG running has reduced the vacuum energy to the level of the matter energy density. ",0,0

According to Bell's theorem, any theory that is based on the joint assumption of realism and locality (meaning that local events cannot be affected by actions in space-like separated regions) is at variance with certain quantum predictions. Experiments with entangled pairs of particles have amply confirmed these quantum predictions, thus rendering local realistic theories untenable. Maintaining realism as a fundamental concept would therefore necessitate the introduction of 'spooky' actions that defy locality. Here we show by both theory and experiment that a broad and rather reasonable class of such non-local realistic theories is incompatible with experimentally observable quantum correlations. In the experiment, we measure previously untested correlations between two entangled photons, and show that these correlations violate an inequality proposed by Leggett for non-local realistic theories. Our result suggests that giving up the concept of locality is not sufficient to be consistent with quantum experiments, unless certain intuitive features of realism are abandoned. ",0,0
"In this manuscript we investigate the capabilities of the Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA) to simulate scattering from particles that are much larger than the wavelength of the incident light, and describe an optimized publicly available DDA computer program that processes the large number of dipoles required for such simulations. Numerical simulations of light scattering by spheres with size parameters x up to 160 and 40 for refractive index m=1.05 and 2 respectively are presented and compared with exact results of the Mie theory. Errors of both integral and angle-resolved scattering quantities generally increase with m and show no systematic dependence on x. Computational times increase steeply with both x and m, reaching values of more than 2 weeks on a cluster of 64 processors. The main distinctive feature of the computer program is the ability to parallelize a single DDA simulation over a cluster of computers, which allows it to simulate light scattering by very large particles, like the ones that are considered in this manuscript. Current limitations and possible ways for improvement are discussed. ",0,0
"In a non supervised Bayesian estimation approach for inverse problems in imaging systems, one tries to estimate jointly the unknown image pixelsand the hyperparameters . This is, in general, done through the joint posterior law p(,|). The expression of this joint law is often very complex and its exploration through sampling and computation of the point estimators such as MAP and posterior means need either optimization of non convex criteria or intégration of non Gaussian and multi variate probability laws. In any of these cases, we need to do approximations. We had explored before the possibilities of Laplace approximation and sampling by MCMC. In this paper, we explore the possibility of approximating this joint law by a separable one inand in . This gives the possibility of developing iterative algorithms with more reasonable computational cost, in particular, if the approximating laws are choosed in the exponential conjugate families. The main objective of this paper is to give details of different algorithms we obtain with different choices of these families. ",0,0
"Probing the geometry of the universe is one of the most important endevours in cosmology. Current observational data from the Cosmic Microwave Background anisotropy (CMB), galaxy surveys and type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) strongly constrain the curvature of the universe to be close to zero for a universe dominated by a cosmological constant or dark energy with a constant equation of state. Here we investigate the role of cosmic priors on deriving these tight bounds on geometry, by considering a landscape motivated scenario with an oscillating curvature term. We perform a likelihood analysis of current data under such a model of non-trivial geometry and find that the uncertainties on curvature, and correspondingly on parameters of the matter and dark energy sectors, are larger. Future dark energy experiments together with CMB data from experiments like Planck could dramatically improve our ability to constrain cosmic curvature under such models enabling us to probe possible imprints of quantum gravity.

"For some 100 years physics has modelled space and time via the spacetime concept, with space being merely an observer dependent perspective effect of that spacetime - space itself had no observer independent existence - it had no ontological status, and it certainly had no dynamical description. In recent years this has all changed. In 2002 it was discovered that a dynamical 3-space had been detected many times, including the Michelson-Morley 1887 light-speed anisotropy experiment. Here we review the dynamics of this 3-space, tracing its evolution from that of an emergent phenomena in the information-theoretic Process Physics to the phenomenological description in terms of a velocity field describing the relative internal motion of the structured 3-space. The new physics of the dynamical 3-space is extensively tested against experimental and astronomical observations, including the necessary generalisation of the Maxwell, Schrodinger and Dirac equations, leading to a derivation and explanation of gravity as a refraction effect of quantum matter waves. The flat and curved spacetime formalisms are derived from the new physics, so explaining their apparent many successes. ",0,0
"Hubble Space Telescope observations of Uranus- and Neptune-crossing object (65489) Ceto/Phorcys (provisionally designated 2003 FX128) reveal it to be a close binary system. The mutual orbit has a period of 9.554 +/- 0.011 days and a semimajor axis of 1840 +/- 48 km. These values enable computation of a system mass of (5.41 +/- 0.42) 10^18 kg. Spitzer Space Telescope observations of thermal emission at 24 and 70 microns are combined with visible photometry to constrain the system's effective radius (109 +10/-11 km) and geometric albedo (0.084 +0.021/-0.014). We estimate the average bulk density to be 1.37 +0.66/-0.32 g cm^-3, consistent with ice plus rocky and/or carbonaceous materials. This density contrasts with lower densities recently measured with the same technique for three other comparably-sized outer Solar System binaries (617) Patroclus, (26308) 1998 SM165, and (47171) 1999 TC36, and is closer to the density of the saturnian irregular satellite Phoebe. The mutual orbit of Ceto and Phorcys is nearly circular, with an eccentricity <= 0.015. This observation is consistent with calculations suggesting that the system should tidally evolve on a timescale shorter than the age of the solar system. ",0,0
"I show that several observable properties of bursting neutron stars in metric theories of gravity can be calculated using only conservation laws, Killing symmetries, and the Einstein equivalence principle, without requiring the validity of the general relativistic field equations. I calculate, in particular, the gravitational redshift of a surface atomic line, the touchdown luminosity of a radius-expansion burst, which is believed to be equal to the Eddington critical luminosity, and the apparent surface area of a neutron star as measured during the cooling tails of bursts. I show that, for a general metric theory of gravity, the apparent surface area of a neutron star depends on the coordinate radius of the stellar surface and on its gravitational redshift in the exact same way as in general relativity. On the other hand, the Eddington critical luminosity depends also on an additional parameter that measures the degree to which the general relativistic field equations are satisfied. These results can be used in conjunction with current and future high-energy observations of bursting neutron stars to test general relativity in the strong-field regime. ",0,0
"We have carried out a survey toward the central regions of 85 starless cores in HCN J = 1-0 to study inward motions in the cores. Sixty-four cores were detected with HCN lines. The infall asymmetry in the HCN spectra is found to be more prevalent, and more prominent than in any other previously used infall tracers such as CS J = 2-1, DCO+ J = 2-1, and N2H+ J = 1-0. We found close relation between the intensities of the HCN and N2H+ lines. This implies that the HCN is not much depleted in the central regions of the cores. In some cores, the HCN spectra show different sign of asymmetry from other molecular lines. A few cores show various signs of asymmetry in individual HCN hyperfine lines. The distribution of the velocity shift dV of the HCN profiles with respect to the systemic velocity of the optically thin tracer is found to be more shifted toward bluer side than those of other infall tracers, indicating that the HCN traces inward motions more frequently. The dV distribution of each HCN hyperfine line for all sources is similar. Moreover the dV values obtained from different HCN hyperfine lines for each source are nearly similar. These may mean that most of starless cores are in similar kinematic states across the layers of the cores. We identify 17 infall candidates using all available indicators such as the velocity shift dV and the blue to red peak intensity ratio of double peaked profiles for HCN J = 1-0, CS J = 2-1, J = 3-2, DCO+ J = 2-1, and N2H+ J = 1-0. Four of them, L63, L492, L694-2, and L1197 are found to show higher blue to red ratio in the HCN hyperfine line along the lower opacity, suggesting that infall speed becomes higher toward the center.

"We consider a system composed of a trapped atom and a trapped ion. The ion charge induces in the atom an electric dipole moment, which attracts it with an r^-4 dependence at large distances. In the regime considered here, the characteristic range of the atom-ion interaction is comparable or larger than the characteristic size of the trapping potential, which excludes the application of the contact pseudopotential. The short-range part of the interaction is described in the framework of quantum-defect theory, by introducing some short-range parameters, which can be related to the s-wave scattering length. When the separation between traps is changed we observe trap-induced shape resonances between molecular bound states and vibrational states of the external trapping potential. Our analysis is extended to quasi-one-dimensional geometries, when the scattering exhibit confinement-induced resonances, similar to the ones studied before for short-range interactions. For quasi-one-dimensional systems we investigate the effects of coupling between the center of mass and relative motion, which occurs for different trapping frequencies of atom and ion traps. Finally, we show how the two types of resonances can be employed for quantum state control and spectroscopy of atom-ion molecules. ",0,0
"We estimate the spin relaxation rate due to spin-orbit coupling and acoustic phonon scattering in weakly-confined quantum dots with up to five interacting electrons. The Full Configuration Interaction approach is used to account for the inter-electron repulsion, and Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings are exactly diagonalized. We show that electron-electron interaction strongly affects spin-orbit admixture in the sample. Consequently, relaxation rates strongly depend on the number of carriers confined in the dot. We identify the mechanisms which may lead to improved spin stability in few electron (>2) quantum dots as compared to the usual one and two electron devices. Finally, we discuss recent experiments on triplet-singlet transitions in GaAs dots subject to external magnetic fields. Our simulations are in good agreement with the experimental findings, and support the interpretation of the observed spin relaxation as being due to spin-orbit coupling assisted by acoustic phonon emission.

"Claims have been made that f0(1370) does not exist. The five primary sets of data requiring its existence are refitted. Major dispersive effects due to the opening of the 4pi threshold are included for the first time; the sigma -> 4pi amplitude plays a strong role. Crystal Barrel data on pbar-p -> 3pizero at rest require f0(1370) signals of at least 32 and 33 standard deviations in 1S0 and 3P1 annihilation respectively. Furthermore, they agree within 5 MeV for mass and width. Data on pbar-p -> eta-eta-pizero agree and require at least a 19 standard deviation contribution. This alone is sufficient to demonstrate the existence of f0(1370). BES II data for J/Psi -> phi-pi-pi contain a visible f0(1370) signal > 8 standard devations. In all cases, a resonant phase variation is required. The possibility of a second pole in the sigma amplitude due to the opening of the 4pi channel is excluded. Cern-Munich data for pi-pi elastic scattering are fitted well with the inclusion of some mixing between sigma, f0(1370) and f0(1500). The pi-pi widths for f2(1565), rho3(1690), rho3(1990) and f4(2040) are determined. ",0,0
"We look for a simple analytic model to distinguish between stellar clusters undergoing a bimodal hydrodynamic solution from those able to drive only a stationary wind. Clusters in the bimodal regime undergo strong radiative cooling within their densest inner regions, which results in the accumulation of the matter injected by supernovae and stellar winds and eventually in the formation of further stellar generations, while their outer regions sustain a stationary wind. The analytic formulae are derived from the basic hydrodynamic equations. Our main assumption, that the density at the star cluster surface scales almost linearly with that at the stagnation radius, is based on results from semi-analytic and full numerical calculations. The analytic formulation allows for the determination of the threshold mechanical luminosity that separates clusters evolving in either of the two solutions. It is possible to fix the stagnation radius by simple analytic expressions and thus to determine the fractions of the deposited matter that clusters evolving in the bimodal regime blow out as a wind or recycle into further stellar generations.

"In line with the local philicity concept proposed by Chattaraj et al. (Chattaraj, P. K.; Maiti, B.; Sarkar, U. J. Phys. Chem. A. 2003, 107, 4973) and a dual descriptor derived by Toro-Labbe and coworkers (Morell, C.; Grand, A.; Toro-Labbe, A. J. Phys. Chem. A. 2005, 109, 205), we propose a multiphilic descriptor. It is defined as the difference between nucleophilic (Wk+) and electrophilic (Wk-) condensed philicity functions. This descriptor is capable of simultaneously explaining the nucleophilicity and electrophilicity of the given atomic sites in the molecule. Variation of these quantities along the path of a soft reaction is also analyzed. Predictive ability of this descriptor has been successfully tested on the selected systems and reactions. Corresponding force profiles are also analyzed in some representative cases. Also, to study the intra- and intermolecular reactivities another related descriptor namely, the nucleophilicity excess (DelW-+) for a nucleophile, over the electrophilicity in it has been defined and tested on all-metal aromatic compounds.

"We determine the contribution of stars in galaxies, intracluster stars, and the intracluster medium to the total baryon budget in nearby galaxy clusters and groups. We find that the baryon mass fraction (f_b) within r500 is constant for systems with M500 between 6e13 and 1e15 Msun. Although f_b is lower than the WMAP value, the shortfall is on the order of both the observational systematic uncertainties and the depletion of baryons within r500 that is predicted by simulations. The data therefore provide no compelling evidence for undetected baryonic components, particularly any that vary in importance with cluster mass. A unique feature of the current analysis is direct inclusion of the contribution of intracluster light (ICL) in the baryon budget. The increase in X-ray gas mass fraction with increasing total mass is entirely accounted for by a decrease in the total stellar mass fraction, supporting the argument that the behavior of both the stellar and X-ray gas components is dominated by a decrease in star formation efficiency in more massive environments. Within just the stellar component, the fraction of the total stellar luminosity in the BCG and ICL decreases as velocity dispersion increases, suggesting that the BCG+ICL component, and in particular the dominant ICL component, grows less efficiently in higher mass environments. The degree to which this behavior arises from our sample selection, which favored systems with central, giant elliptical galaxies, remains unclear. A more robust result is the identification of low mass groups with large BCG+ICL components, demonstrating that the creation of intracluster stars does not require a massive cluster environment. Within r500 and r200, the BCG+ICL contributes on average 40",0,0

"An overview of game-theoretic approaches to energy-efficient resource allocation in wireless networks is presented. Focusing on multiple-access networks, it is demonstrated that game theory can be used as an effective tool to study resource allocation in wireless networks with quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. A family of non-cooperative (distributed) games is presented in which each user seeks to choose a strategy that maximizes its own utility while satisfying its QoS requirements. The utility function considered here measures the number of reliable bits that are transmitted per joule of energy consumed and, hence, is particulary suitable for energy-constrained networks. The actions available to each user in trying to maximize its own utility are at least the choice of the transmit power and, depending on the situation, the user may also be able to choose its transmission rate, modulation, packet size, multiuser receiver, multi-antenna processing algorithm, or carrier allocation strategy. The best-response strategy and Nash equilibrium for each game is presented. Using this game-theoretic framework, the effects of power control, rate control, modulation, temporal and spatial signal processing, carrier allocation strategy and delay QoS constraints on energy efficiency and network capacity are quantified.

"Surviving in a diverse environment requires corresponding organism responses. At the cellular level, such adjustment relies on the transcription factors (TFs) which must rapidly find their target sequences amidst a vast amount of non-relevant sequences on DNA molecules. Whether these transcription factors locate their target sites through a 1D or 3D pathway is still a matter of speculation. It has been suggested that the optimum search time is when the protein equally shares its search time between 1D and 3D diffusions. In this paper, we study the above problem using a Monte Carlo simulation by considering a very simple physical model. A 1D strip, representing a DNA, with a number of low affinity sites, corresponding to non-target sites, and high affinity sites, corresponding to target sites, is considered and later extended to a 2D strip. We study the 1D and 3D exploration pathways, and combinations of the two modes by considering three different types of molecules: a walker that randomly walks along the strip with no dissociation; a jumper that represents dissociation and then re-association of a TF with the strip at later time at a distant site; and a hopper that is similar to the jumper but it dissociates and then re-associates at a faster rate than the jumper. We analyze the final probability distribution of molecules for each case and find that TFs can locate their targets fast enough even if they spend 15",0,0

"Observations of gamma ray bursts (GRBs) with Swift produced the initially surprising result that many bursts have large X-ray flares superimposed on the underlying afterglow. The flares were sometimes intense, had rapid rise and decay phases, and occurred late relative to the “prompt” phase. Some remarkable flares are observed with fluence comparable to the prompt GRB fluence. Many GRBs have several flares, which are sometimes overlapping. Short, intense, repetitive, and late flaring can be most easily understood within the context of the standard fireball model with the internal engine that powers the prompt GRB emission in an active state at late times. However, other models for flares have been proposed. Flare origin can be investigated by comparing the flare spectra to that of the afterglow and the initial prompt emission. In this work, we have analyzed all significant X-ray flares from the first 110 GRBs observed by Swift. From this sample 33 GRBs were found to have significant X-ray flares, with 77 flares that were detected above the 3σ level. In addition to temporal analysis presented in a companion paper, a variety of spectral models have been fit to each flare. In some cases, we find that the spectral fits favor a Band function model, which is more akin to the prompt emission than to that of an afterglow. We find that the average fluence of the flares is 2.4e-7 erg/cm^2/s in the 0.2-10 keV energy band, which is approximately a factor of ten below the average prompt GRB fluence. These results, when combined with those presented in the companion paper on temporal properties of flares, supports the hypothesis that most X-ray flares are late-time activity of the internal engine that spawned the initial GRB; not an afterglow related effect.

"KS 1741-293, discovered in 1989 by the X-ray camera TTM in the Kvant module of the Mir space station and identified as an X-ray burster, has not been detected in the hard X band until the advent of the INTEGRAL observatory. Moreover this source has been recently object of scientific discussion, being also associated to a nearby extended radio source that in principle could be the supernova remnant produced by the accretion induced collapse in the binary system. Our long term monitoring with INTEGRAL, covering the period from February 2003 to May 2005, confirms that KS 1741-293 is transient in soft and hard X band. When the source is active, from a simultaneous JEM-X and IBIS data analysis, we provide a wide band spectrum from 5 to 100 keV, that can be fit by a two component model, a multiple blackbody for the soft emission and a Comptonized or a cut-off power law model for the hard component. Finally, by the detection of two X-ray bursters with JEM-X, we confirm the bursting nature of KS 1741-293, including this source in the class of the hard tailed X-ray bursters. ",0,0
"A general theory is presented for the treatment of decoherence of a multilevel quantum system (with many degrees of freedom) interacting with multi-bath reservoir and driven by ac fields. In this approach, the system is described by a reduced density operator and the multi-bath reservoir is characterized by a number of spectral densities. The reduced density operator is governed by the master equation in which the effect of ac driving fields and the leakage to non-computational states are included. The theory is applied to the study of decoherence of a two-dimensional (2D) SQUID flux qubit coupled to control and readout circuits. The predicted results are in very good agreement with available experimental results in the absence of driving fields and with the analytic results of a dissipative two-level system in the presence of weak driving fields. The relaxation and decoherence times versus the parameters and temperature of the control and readout circuits are also explored in details to facilitate the optimization of the 2D SQUID qubit. ",0,0
We predict the nature (attractive or repulsive) and range (exponentially screened or long-range power law) of the electrostatic interactions of oppositely charged and planar plates as a function of the salt concentration and surface charge densities (whose absolute magnitudes are not necessarily equal). An analytical expression for the crossover between attractive and repulsive pressure is obtained as a function of the salt concentration. This condition reduces to the high-salt limit of Parsegian and Gingell where the interaction is exponentially screened and to the zero salt limit of Lau and Pincus in which the important length scales are the inter-plate separation and the Gouy-Chapman length. In the regime of low salt and high surface charges we predict - for any ratio of the charges on the surfaces - that the attractive pressure is long-ranged as a function of the spacing. The attractive pressure is related to the decrease in counter-ion concentration as the inter-plate distance is decreased. Our theory predicts several scaling regimes with different scaling expressions for the pressure as function of salinity and surface charge densities. The pressure predictions can be related to surface force experiments of oppositely charged surfaces that are prepared by coating one of the mica surfaces with an oppositely charged polyelectrolyte. ,0,0

"We apply a previously developed Gibbs sampling framework to the foreground corrected 3-yr WMAP polarization data and compute the power spectrum and residual foreground template amplitude posterior distributions. We first analyze the co-added Q- and V-band data, and compare our results to the likelihood code published by the WMAP team. We find good agreement, and thus verify the numerics and data processing steps of both approaches. However, we also analyze the Q- and V-bands separately, allowing for non-zero EB cross-correlations and including two individual foreground template amplitudes tracing synchrotron and dust emission. In these analyses, we find tentative evidence of systematics: The foreground tracers correlate with each of the Q- and V-band sky maps individually, although not with the co-added QV map; there is a noticeable negative EB cross-correlation at l <16 in the V-band map; and finally, when relaxing the constraints on EB and BB, noticeable differences are observed between the marginalized band powers in the Q- and V-bands.

"We report the results of spectroscopic mapping observations carried out toward small (1 x 1 arcmin) regions within the supernova remnants W44, W28, IC443, and 3C391 using the Infrared Spectrograph of the Spitzer Space Telescope. These observations, covering the 5.2 - 37 micron spectral region, have led to the detection of a total of 15 fine structure transitions of Ne+, Ne++, Si+, P+, S, S++, Cl+, Fe+, and Fe++; the S(0) - S(7) pure rotational lines of molecular hydrogen; and the R(3) and R(4) transitions of hydrogen deuteride. In addition to these 25 spectral lines, the 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.3 and 12.6 micron PAH emission bands were also observed. Most of the detected line transitions have proven strong enough to map in several sources, providing a comprehensive picture of the relative distribution of the various line emissions observable in the Spitzer/IRS bandpass. A principal component analysis of the spectral line maps reveals that the observed emission lines fall into five distinct groups, each of which may exhibit a distinct spatial distribution: (1) lines of S and H2 (J > 2); (2) the H2 S(0) line; (3) lines of ions with appearance potentials less than 13.6 eV; (4) lines of ions with appearance potentials greater than 13.6 eV, not including S++; (5) lines of S++. Lines of group (1) likely originate in molecular material subject to a slow, nondissociative shock that is driven by the overpressure within the supernova remnant, and lines in groups (3) - (5) are associated primarily with dissociative shock fronts with a range of (larger) shock velocities. The H2 S(0) line shows a low-density diffuse emission component, and - in some sources - a shock-excited component. ",0,0
"Let P(z) and Q(y) be polynomials of the same degree k>=1 in the complex variables z and y, respectively. In this extended abstract we study the non-linear functional equation P(z)=Q(y(z)), where y(z) is restricted to be analytic in a neighborhood of z=0. We provide sufficient conditions to ensure that all the roots of Q(y) are contained within the range of y(z) as well as to have y(z)=z as the unique analytic solution of the non-linear equation. Our results are motivated from uniqueness considerations of polynomial canonical representations of the phase or amplitude terms of oscillatory integrals encountered in the asymptotic analysis of the coefficients of mixed powers and multivariable generating functions via saddle-point methods. Uniqueness shall prove important for developing algorithms to determine the Taylor coefficients of the terms appearing in these representations. The uniqueness of Levinson's polynomial canonical representations of analytic functions in several variables follows as a corollary of our one-complex variables results. ",0,0
"The expansion of ionization fronts in uniform and spherically symmetric power-law density distributions is a well-studied topic. However, in many situations, such as a star formed at the edge of a molecular cloud core, an offset power-law density distribution would be more appropriate. In this paper a few of the main issues of the formation and expansion of HII regions in such media are outlined and results are presented for the particular cases where the underlying power laws are 1/r^2 and 1/r^3. A simple criterion is developed for determining whether the initial photoionized region will be unbounded, which depends on the power-law exponent and the ratio of the equivalent Stroemgren radius produced by the star in a uniform medium to the stellar offset distance. In the expansion stage, the ionized volumes will eventually become unbounded unless pressure balance with the external medium is reached before the ionization front velocity becomes supersonic with respect to the ionized gas.

"The gravitational lensing effect was first predicted by Einstein in 1915, but it took another 50 years before the first confirmed observation could be made.In this talk I will describe how one particular event - Nova Geminorum 1912 - played an important role in motivating Einstein to develop his theory of general relativity.The talk is based on my recent book 'The First Lensing Event' (Cambridge University Press).Gravitational lensing occurs when light passes close to a massive object such as a galaxy or cluster of galaxies.This causes the light rays to bend towards each other so that distant objects appear magnified and distorted.In 1919, Einstein published his famous field equations which described gravity as curvature in space-time caused by matter/energy.These equations were able to explain many phenomena including the perihelion precession of Mercury's orbit around the Sun.However, there remained some puzzles about these equations.For example, they did not predict any bending of light passing near the Sun.Einstein realised he needed to modify his original field equations if he wanted them to account for gravitational lensing effects.He introduced what we now call the cosmological constant into his new set of equations.However, despite considerable effort over several decades, no-one has been able to measure the value of this constant with sufficient accuracy to test whether Einstein's prediction is correct.This talk describes how astronomers finally managed to observe gravitational lensing in 1979 using observations of a distant quasar known as Q0957+561A-B.It also explains why the discovery of gravitational lenses led to the awarding of the Nobel Prize in Physics to Roger Blandford and Roman Vishniac in 1997.",1,1
"We present an analysis of all known short-period cataclysmic variables (CVs) in which we find that most systems have orbital periods longer than 3 hrs and are dominated by SW Sex stars, while those with shorter periods tend to be AM Her binaries. We show that this dichotomy is consistent with theoretical predictions for the evolution of CVs driven by angular momentum loss via gravitational radiation. The observed distribution of orbital periods can also be explained if there exists a minimum period below which no CVs exist due to magnetic braking. This result has important implications on our understanding of how CVs evolve towards shorter orbital periods. Cataclysmic Variables (CVs), interacting binary star systems consisting of a white dwarf primary accreting matter from its low-mass companion through Roche lobe overflow, are among the best studied classes of close binary stars. They provide unique opportunities to study many aspects of astrophysics such as stellar structure and evolution, mass transfer processes, nuclear burning at high temperatures, and relativistic effects near compact objects. In particular, they offer insights into the formation mechanisms of both single and double degenerate white dwarfs, the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae.",1,1
"We present an extension to the cable model that allows one to account for membrane dynamics in neurons with active conductances over a wide range of time scales and spatial dimensions, including those relevant to subthreshold electrogenesis. The proposed approach is based on a reformulation of the cable equation as a system of first-order differential equations describing voltage changes along the axon or dendrite. This formulation leads naturally to a generalization of the concept of space constants to include both passive and active components of the membrane impedance. We show how this generalized cable formalism can be used to describe propagation of action potentials through a single compartment neuron with Hodgkin-Huxley type currents. Finally we demonstrate its utility by applying it to study spatiotemporal patterns of activity in networks of coupled neurons. Neurons are highly specialized cells capable of generating electrical signals known as action potentials (APs). These APs propagate down the length of the cell's axon toward synaptic terminals where they trigger release of neurotransmitters into the synapse. In turn these transmitters bind to receptors located on the postsynaptic side of the synapse initiating signaling cascades which ultimately lead to generation of new APs. Thus information transfer between neurons occurs via propagating APs across chemical synapses.",1,1

Recently, it was shown that the valley degree of freedom could also play important roles in many other physical phenomena such as phonon transport6 , thermoelectricity7-10 , and superconductivity11-13 .Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are emerging two-dimensional semiconductors14-17 with broken inversion symmetry18-20 due to their unique layered structure21-23 . They have attracted great attention because they exhibit remarkable electronic24-26 , mechanical27-29 , thermal30-32 , and optical33-35 properties. Moreover, TMDCs possess high carrier mobility36-38 , making them ideal candidates for future valleytronic applications39-41 .Here we demonstrate valley-dependent optoelectronic properties of monolayer WSe2 using time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy42-45 . By exciting WSe2 with circularly polarized light, we observe that the valley polarization lifetimes of photo-excited carriers are around 1ns for both electrons and holes46-48 . Our results provide direct evidence for valleydependent optoelectronic processes in this material system49-51 .",1,1
"We prove that the relative entropy between two density matrices is equal to the difference between their von Neumann entropies, and we show how this result can be used for proving security against eavesdropping attacks on quantum key distribution protocols.We also present some examples where our results are applied. The relative entropy between two density operators ρ and σ is defined asD(ρ||σ) = ∑_i p_i logp_i/σ^*(σ(ψ̂_i))where (ψ̂_̂î,p_1,...,p_n) is any complete set of eigenvectors of both ρ and σ^∗ σ such that ∑_ip_i = 1.In particular, if one considers the case when ρ is the state sent by Alice (the sender), while σ is the state received by Bob (the receiver), then the quantity D(ρ||σ) represents Eve's uncertainty about what was transmitted through the channel.",1,1
"The Chandra X-ray Observatory has observed the supernova remnant (SNR) produced by SN1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud for over ten years, providing an unprecedented view into this young and energetic object.The observations have revealed that the blast wave is interacting with dense circumstellar material surrounding the progenitor star at velocities up to 1000 km/sec.This interaction produces bright knots of emission which are seen as moving outward through the shell of the remnant.These knots appear to be composed primarily of oxygen-rich ejecta mixed with shocked interstellar gas.In addition, there appears to be a large amount of hot plasma trapped behind the forward shock front.We present here new results on these features based on our analysis of data obtained during the first year of the Chandra mission.

"The low-energy parameters of neutron-proton scattering are determined by using modern experimental data obtained in partial-wave analyses (PWAs). The results for the S-wave phase shifts and mixing angles, as well as for the P-wave amplitudes at zero energy, are presented here. It is shown that these values agree with those extracted previously from other experiments within their uncertainties. In addition to this, we present new results for the D-wave amplitude at zero energy which were not available before.I. INTRODUCTIO N Neutron-proton elastic scattering has been studied extensively over many decades [1] . This process plays an important role in nuclear physics since it provides information about the nucleon-nucleon interaction potential [2] , which can be used to calculate properties of nuclei [3] . In recent years there have been significant advances in our understanding of the structure of the nucleon-nucleus system [4] . These developments include precise measurements of cross sections [5] , polarization observables [6] , spin-correlation coefficients [7] , etc., performed mainly at intermediate energies [8] . However, despite all efforts made so far, some questions remain open [9] . For example, one still needs more accurate determinations of the lowenergy parameters of the nucleonnucleon interaction [10] .",1,1
"The cosmological electroweak phase transition is now known to be first order, and it has been suggested that this may have important consequences for baryogenesis in the early universe.In contrast, there are no compelling theoretical reasons why the analogous quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phase transition should also be first-order.Here we argue that if the QCD phase transition were indeed second-order then it would lead to an unacceptably large number density of topological defects such as monopoles or cosmic strings at late times.We show how these constraints can be satisfied by introducing new physics into the Standard Model which leads to a strongly first-order phase transition with a critical temperature T_c100 GeV. The cosmological electroweak phase tran-sition is now known to be of first order [1] , and it has been suggested [2] that this could have important consequences for baryogensis in the early universe. In contrast, there are few compelling theoretical reasons [3] why the analogous quantum chromo-dynamics (QCD) [4] phase transition should also be of first order. If the QCD phase transition was instead second-order [5] , then it would lead to unacceptable numbers [6] of topological defects [7, 8] such as monopoles [9] or cosmic strings [10] . These constraints can be satisfied [11] by introducing new physics [12] into the Standard Model [13] which leads to a strongly-first-order [14] phase transition [15] with a critical temperature Tc 100GeV [16] .",1,1
