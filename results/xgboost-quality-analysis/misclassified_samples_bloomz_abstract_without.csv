"We show that the jet structure of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) can be investigated with the tail emission of the prompt GRB. The tail emission which we consider is identified as a steep-decay component of the early X-ray afterglow observed by the X-ray Telescope onboard Swift. Using a Monte Carlo method, we derive, for the first time, the distribution of the decay index of the GRB tail emission for various jet models. The new definitions of the zero of time and the time interval of a fitting region are proposed. These definitions for fitting the light curve lead us an unique definition of the decay index, which is useful to investigate the structure of the GRB jet. We find that if the GRB jet has a core-envelope structure, the predicted distribution of the decay index of the tail has a wide scatter and has multiple peaks, which cannot be seen for the case of the uniform and the Gaussian jet. Therefore, the decay index distribution tells us the information on the jet structure. Especially, if we observe events whose decay index is less than about 2, both the uniform and the Gaussian jet models will be disfavored according to our simulation study. ",0,1
"Arguments showing that exchange-only optimized effective potential (xOEP) methods, with finite basis sets, cannot in general yield the Hartree-Fock (HF) ground state energy, but a higher one, are given. While the orbital products of a complete basis are linearly dependent, the HF ground state energy can only be obtained via a basis set xOEP scheme in the special case that all products of occupied and unoccupied orbitals emerging from the employed orbital basis set are linearly independent from each other. In this case, however, exchange potentials leading to the HF ground state energy exhibit unphysical oscillations and do not represent a Kohn-Sham (KS) exchange potential. These findings solve the seemingly paradoxical results of Staroverov, Scuseria and Davidson that certain finite basis set xOEP calculations lead to the HF ground state energy despite the fact that within a real space (or complete basis) representation the xOEP ground state energy is always higher than the HF energy. Moreover, whether or not the occupied and unoccupied orbital products are linearly independent, it is shown that basis set xOEP methods only represent exact exchange-only (EXX) KS methods, i.e., proper density-functional methods, if the orbital basis set and the auxiliary basis set representing the exchange potential are balanced to each other, i.e., if the orbital basis is comprehensive enough for a given auxiliary basis. Otherwise xOEP methods do not represent EXX KS methods and yield unphysical exchange potentials. ",0,1
"We describe our software package Block Locally Optimal Preconditioned Eigenvalue Xolvers (BLOPEX) publicly released recently. BLOPEX is available as a stand-alone serial library, as an external package to PETSc (“Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation”, a general purpose suite of tools for the scalable solution of partial differential equations and related problems developed by Argonne National Laboratory), and is also built into hypre (“High Performance Preconditioners”, scalable linear solvers package developed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory). The present BLOPEX release includes only one solver–the Locally Optimal Block Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (LOBPCG) method for symmetric eigenvalue problems. hypre provides users with advanced high-quality parallel preconditioners for linear systems, in particular, with domain decomposition and multigrid preconditioners. With BLOPEX, the same preconditioners can now be efficiently used for symmetric eigenvalue problems. PETSc facilitates the integration of independently developed application modules with strict attention to component interoperability, and makes BLOPEX extremely easy to compile and use with preconditioners that are available via PETSc. We present the LOBPCG algorithm in BLOPEX for hypre and PETSc. We demonstrate numerically the scalability of BLOPEX by testing it on a number of distributed and shared memory parallel systems, including a Beowulf system, SUN Fire 880, an AMD dual-core Opteron workstation, and IBM BlueGene/L supercomputer, using PETSc domain decomposition and hypre multigrid preconditioning. We test BLOPEX on a model problem, the standard 7-point finite-difference approximation of the 3-D Laplacian, with the problem size in the range 10^5-10^8. ",0,1
"We analyze the observations of the transient X-ray pulsar 4U 0115+63 with the RXTE and INTEGRAL observatories in a wide X-ray (3-100 keV) energy band during its intense outbursts in 1999 and 2004. The energy of the fundamental harmonic of the cyclotron resonance absorption line near the maximum of the X-ray flux from the source (luminosity range 5x10^37 - 2x10^38 erg/s) is11 keV. When the pulsar luminosity falls below5x10^37 erg/s, the energy of the fundamental harmonic is displaced sharply toward the high energies, up to16 keV. Under the assumption of a dipole magnetic field configuration, this change in cyclotron harmonic energy corresponds to a decrease in the height of the emitting region by2 km, while other spectral parameters, in particular, the cutoff energy, remain essentially constant. At a luminosity7x10^37 erg/s, four almost equidistant cyclotron line harmonics are clearly seen in the spectrum. This suggests that either the region where the emission originates is compact or the emergent spectrum from different (in height) segments of the accretion column is uniform. We have found significant pulse profile variations with energy, luminosity, and time. In particular, we show that the profile variations from pulse to pulse are not reduced to a simple modulation of the accretion rate specified by external conditions. ",0,1
"We make use of new near and mid-IR photometry of the Pleiades cluster in order to help identify proposed cluster members. We also use the new photometry with previously published photometry to define the single-star main sequence locus at the age of the Pleiades in a variety of color-magnitude planes.The new near and mid-IR photometry extend effectively two magnitudes deeper than the 2MASS All-Sky Point Source catalog, and hence allow us to select a new set of candidate very low mass and sub-stellar mass members of the Pleiades in the central square degree of the cluster. We identify 42 new candidate members fainter than Ks =14 (corresponding to 0.1 Mo). These candidate members should eventually allow a better estimate of the cluster mass function to be made down to of order 0.04 solar masses.We also use new IRAC data, in particular the images obtained at 8 um, in order to comment briefly on interstellar dust in and near the Pleiades. We confirm, as expected, that – with one exception – a sample of low mass stars recently identified as having 24 um excesses due to debris disks do not have significant excesses at IRAC wavelengths. However, evidence is also presented that several of the Pleiades high mass stars are found to be impacting with local condensations of the molecular cloud that is passing through the Pleiades at the current epoch.

"We consider the extension of the supersymmetric Pati-Salam model which solves the b-quark mass problem of supersymmetric grand unified models with exact Yukawa unification and universal boundary conditions and leads to the so-called new shifted hybrid inflationary scenario. We show that this model can also lead to a new version of smooth hybrid inflation based only on renormalizable interactions provided that a particular parameter of its superpotential is somewhat small. The potential possesses valleys of minima with classical inclination, which can be used as inflationary paths. The model is consistent with the fitting of the three-year Wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe data by the standard power-law cosmological model with cold dark matter and a cosmological constant. In particular, the spectral index turns out to be adequately small so that it is compatible with the data. Moreover, the Pati-Salam gauge group is broken to the standard model gauge group during inflation and, thus, no monopoles are formed at the end of inflation. Supergravity corrections based on a non-minimal Kaehler potential with a convenient choice of a sign keep the spectral index comfortably within the allowed range without generating maxima and minima of the potential on the inflationary path. So, unnatural restrictions on the initial conditions for inflation can be avoided. ",0,1
"It is generally believed that the magnetic free energy accumulated in the corona serves as a main energy source for solar explosions such as coronal mass ejections (CMEs). In the framework of the flux rope catastrophe model for CMEs, the energy may be abruptly released either by an ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) catastrophe, which belongs to a global magnetic topological instability of the system, or by a fast magnetic reconnection across preexisting or rapidly-developing electric current sheets. Both ways of magnetic energy release are thought to be important to CME dynamics. To disentangle their contributions, we construct a flux rope catastrophe model in the corona and solar wind and compare different cases in which we either prohibit or allow magnetic reconnection to take place across rapidly-growing current sheets during the eruption. It is demonstrated that CMEs, even fast ones, can be produced taking the ideal MHD catastrophe as the only process of magnetic energy release. Nevertheless, the eruptive speed can be significantly enhanced after magnetic reconnection sets in. In addition, a smooth transition from slow to fast eruptions is observed when increasing the strength of the background magnetic field, simply because in a stronger field there is more free magnetic energy at the catastrophic point available to be released during an eruption. This suggests that fast and slow CMEs may have an identical driving mechanism. ",0,1
"The first challenge in the formation of both terrestrial planets and the cores of gas giants is the retention of grains in protoplanetary disks. In most regions of these disks, gas attains sub-Keplerian speeds as a consequence of a negative pressure gradient. Hydrodynamic drag leads to orbital decay and depletion of the solid material in the disk, with characteristic timescales as short as only a few hundred years for meter-sized objects at 1 AU. In this paper, we suggest a particle retention mechanism which promotes the accumulation of grains and the formation of planetesimals near the water sublimation front or “snow line.” This model is based on the assumption that, in the regions most interesting for planet formation, the viscous evolution of the disk is due to turbulence driven by the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) in the surface layers of the disk. The depth to which MRI effectively generates turbulence is a strong function of the grain size and abundance. A sharp increase in the grain-to-gas density ratio across the snow line reduces the column depth of the active layer. As the disk evolves towards a quasi-steady-state, this change in the active layer creates a local maximum in radial distribution of the gas surface density and pressure, causing the gas to rotate at super-Keplerian speed and halting the inward migration of grains. This senario presents a robust process for grain retention which may aid in the formation of proto-gas-giant cores preferentially near the snow line. ",0,1
"Ongoing accretion onto galactic disks has been recently theorized to progress via the unstable cooling of the baryonic halo into condensed clouds. These clouds have been identified as analogous to the High-Velocity Clouds (HVCs) observed in HI in our Galaxy. Here we compare the distribution of HVCs observed around our own Galaxy and extra-planar gas around the Andromeda galaxy to these possible HVC analogs in a simulation of galaxy formation that naturally generates these condensed clouds. We find a very good correspondence between these observations and the simulation, in terms of number, angular size, velocity distribution, overall flux and flux distribution of the clouds. We show that condensed cloud accretion only accounts for0.2 M_solar / year of the current overall Galactic accretion in the simulations. We also find that the simulated halo clouds accelerate and become more massive as they fall toward the disk. The parameter space of the simulated clouds is consistent with all of the observed HVC complexes that have distance constraints, except the Magellanic Stream which is known to have a different origin. We also find that nearly half of these simulated halo clouds would be indistinguishable from lower-velocity gas and that this effect is strongest further from the disk of the galaxy, thus indicating a possible missing population of HVCs. These results indicate that the majority of HVCs are consistent with being infalling, condensed clouds that are a remnant of Galaxy formation. ",0,1
"The power spectral density (PSD) function is commonly used to specify seismometer performance. It is derived from the FFT of acceleration and correction is made for the transfer function of the instrument that generated the data. As with any such spectrum of density (`per Hz') type, the noise inherent to a PSD is large. This article illustrates the value of a function that is derived from the PSD and for which the influence of noise is significantly reduced. Called the cumulative spectral power (CSP), it is obtained from the PSD through the noise-reducing process of integration. The maximum of the CSP (corresponding to the longest graphed value of the period) provides a means for estimating the total vibrational power of the earth. The present author has significantly simplified the process of PSD generation. Thus routine graphing is straightforwared-of first the FFT, followed by the generation of both a PSD and its associated CSP. The unique properties of the CSP make it valuable for the study of a variety of earth dynamics. For example, the strking simplicity of a CSP graph generated from a record containing a strong teleseismic earthquake is undoubtedly important to the development and refinement of any viable theory of earthquake dynamics.

"We derive a perturbation expansion for general self-interacting random walks, where steps are made on the basis of the history of the path. Examples of models where this expansion applies are reinforced random walk, excited random walk, the true (weakly) self-avoiding walk, loop-erased random walk, and annealed random walk in random environment.In this paper we show that the expansion gives rise to useful formulae for the speed and variance of the random walk, when these quantities are known to exist. The results and formulae of this paper have been used elsewhere by the authors to prove monotonicity properties for the speed (in high dimensions) of excited random walk and related models, and certain models of random walk in random environment.We also derive a law of large numbers and central limit theorem (with explicit error terms) directly from this expansion, under strong assumptions on the expansion coefficients. The assumptions are shown to be satisfied by excited random walk in high dimensions with small excitation parameter, a model of reinforced random walk with underlying drift and small reinforcement parameter, and certain models of random walk in random environment under strong ellipticity conditions. This is the extended version of the paper, where we provide all proofs. ",0,1
"Modifications to quark and antiquark fragmentation functions due to quark-quark (antiquark) double scattering in nuclear medium are studied systematically up to order O(α_s^2)in deeply inelastic scattering (DIS) off nuclear targets. At the orderO(α_s^2), twist-four contributions from quark-quark (antiquark) rescattering also exhibit the Landau-Pomeranchuck-Midgal (LPM) interference feature similar to gluon bremsstrahlung induced by multiple parton scattering. Compared to quark-gluon scattering, the modification, which is dominated byt-channel quark-quark (antiquark) scattering, is only smaller by a factor ofC_F/C_A=4/9times the ratio of quark and gluon distributions in the medium. Such a modification is not negligible for realistic kinematics and finite medium size. The modifications to quark (antiquark) fragmentation functions from quark-antiquark annihilation processes are shown to be determined by the antiquark (quark) distribution density in the medium. The asymmetry in quark and antiquark distributions in nuclei will lead to different modifications of quark and antiquark fragmentation functions inside a nucleus, which qualitatively explains the experimentally observed flavor dependence of the leading hadron suppression in semi-inclusive DIS off nuclear targets. The quark-antiquark annihilation processes also mix quark and gluon fragmentation functions in the large fractional momentum region, leading to a flavor dependence of jet quenching in heavy-ion collisions.",0,1
"Cosmological shock waves result from supersonic flow motions induced by hierarchical clustering of nonlinear structures in the universe. These shocks govern the nature of cosmic plasma through thermalization of gas and acceleration of nonthermal, cosmic-ray (CR) particles. We study the statistics and energetics of shocks formed in cosmological simulations of a concordance ΛCDM universe, with a special emphasis on the effects of non-gravitational processes such as radiative cooling, photoionization/heating, and galactic superwind feedbacks. Adopting an improved model for gas thermalization and CR acceleration efficiencies based on nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration calculations, we then estimate the gas thermal energy and the CR energy dissipated at shocks through the history of the universe. Since shocks can serve as sites for generation of vorticity, we also examine the vorticity that should have been generated mostly at curved shocks in cosmological simulations. We find that the dynamics and energetics of shocks are governed primarily by the gravity of matter, so other non-gravitational processes do not affect significantly the global energy dissipation and vorticity generation at cosmological shocks. Our results reinforce scenarios in which the intracluster medium and warm-hot intergalactic medium contain energetically significant populations of nonthermal particles and turbulent flow motions.

This paper presents a hybrid approach to spatial indexing of two dimensional data. It sheds new light on the age old problem by thinking of the traditional algorithms as working with images. Inspiration is drawn from an analogous situation that is found in machine and human vision. Image processing techniques are used to assist in the spatial indexing of the data. A fixed grid approach is used and bins with too many records are sub-divided hierarchically. Search queries are pre-computed for bins that do not contain any data records. This has the effect of dividing the search space up into non rectangular regions which are based on the spatial properties of the data. The bucketing quad tree can be considered as an image with a resolution of two by two for each layer. The results show that this method performs better than the quad tree if there are more divisions per layer. This confirms our suspicions that the algorithm works better if it gets to look at the data with higher resolution images. An elegant class structure is developed where the implementation of concrete spatial indexes for a particular data type merely relies on rendering the data onto an image. ,0,1
"This thesis discusses the search for supersymmetry at the future Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the ongoing construction of one of the four large LHC experiments, the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS), and focuses on the detection of signals from the annihilation of supersymmetric dark matter in the spectra of cosmic rays.Measurements of cosmic ray antiparticles, such as positrons, can impose strong constraints on the nature of new physics beyond the Standard Model. However, cosmic ray positron measurements are experimentally very challenging due to the vast proton background. A novel approach of positron identification with the space-borne AMS-01 experiment, namely through the detection of bremsstrahlung conversion in a silicon microstrip detector, is introduced. Bremsstrahlung from protons is suppressed by a factor of more than 3*10^6 with respect to positrons. The results of the positron measurement show that the bremsstrahlung approach extends the sensitivity range of AMS-01 to positron momenta up to 50 GeV/c, which is far beyond the original scope of the experiment. At momenta above 8 GeV/c there is indication for a positron overabundance with respect to model predictions for purely secondary positron production. Therefore, the AMS-01 data lend further weight to the hints of a positron overabundance seen in the data from earlier experiments.The positron fraction measurements from the most recent experiments are combined with the results of this analysis, giving the most precise positron fraction data yet available.

"Fifteen years ago, a structural analysis of the hormone insulin and the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (RB) revealed that they may physically interact with one another. Subsequently, an RB peptide corresponding to the proposed RB binding site for insulin was found to recognize full-length insulin in vitro. As part of efforts aimed at developing this RB peptide into an anti-cancer drug, this molecule was chemically coupled to a cellular internalization signal and termed 'MCR peptide'. Meanwhile, several such MCR peptide variants have been demonstrated to restrain the proliferation of different human cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, one of the MCR peptides coined MCR-10 was shown to be capable of interfering with the complex formation between insulin and RB in HepG2 human hepatoma cells, as monitored by immunofluorescence. This latter result indicating an in vivo association between insulin and RB was confirmed by a follow-up study combining the methods of co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Here, we provide evidence for the existence of the insulin-RB complex in A549 human non-small cell lung cancer cells. Specifically, we demonstrate this heterodimer by means of a magnetic beads-based immunoprecipitation approach and equally show that this dimer can be disrupted by MCR-4 or MCR-10 each of which is known to possess antiproliferative properties, yet to a much lesser extent by a control peptide. Thus, this investigation has yielded another important proof for the occurrence of the insulin-RB dimer and, furthermore, its validity as a target for antineoplastic MCR peptides. ",0,1
"An end-grafted flexible polymer chain in 3d space between two pistons undergoes an abrupt transition from a confined coil to a flower-like conformation when the number of monomers in the chain, N, reaches a critical value. In 2d geometry, excluded volume interactions between monomers of a chain confined inside a strip of finite length 2L transform the coil conformation into a linear string of blobs. However, the blob picture raises questions on the nature of this escape transition. To check the theoretical predictions based on the blob picture we study 2d single polymer chains with excluded volume interactions and with one end grafted in the middle of a strip of length2L and width H by simulating self-avoiding walks on a square lattice with the pruned-enriched-Rosenbluth method (PERM). We estimate the free energy, the end-to-end distance, the number of imprisoned monomers, the order parameter, and its distribution. It is shown that in the thermodynamic limit of large N and L but finite L/N, there is a small but finite jump in several average characteristics, including the order parameter. We also present a theoretical description based on the Landau free energy approach, which is in good agreement with the simulation results. Both simulation results and the analytical theory indicate that the 2d escape transition is a weak first-order phase transition. ",0,1
"Observational cosmology provides us with a large number of high precision data which are used to derive models trying to reproduce “on the mean” our observable patch of the Universe. Most of these attempts are achieved in the framework of a Friedmann-Lemaître cosmology where large scale homogeneity is assumed. However, we know, from the observation of structures at increasing scales, that these models are only approximations of a smoothed or averaged inhomogeneous underlying patern. Anyhow, when modelling the Universe, the usual method is to use continuous functions representing the kinematical scalars of the velocity field, implicitly assuming that they represent volume averages of the corresponding fine-scale inhomogeneous quantities, then put them into the Einstein equations which are solved to give the model and its dependance upon a number of parameters arbitrarily defined. In General Relativity, such a method is very much involved since the equations which determine the metric tensor and the quantities calculated from it are highly nonlinear. The question raised by the method consisting of determining the parameters of an a priori assumed FLRW model from observational data is the “fitting problem” brought to general attention by Ellis and Stoeger in the 80's. This problem has recently experienced a reniewed attention due to the amount of available data and the increase of the minimum scale at which homogeneity can be assumed. We propose a discussion of this issue in the light of the latest developments of observational and theoretical cosmology. ",0,1
"Scaling predictions and results from self-consistent field calculations for bottle-brush polymers with a rigid backbone and flexible side chains under good solvent conditions are summarized and their validity and applicability is assessed by a comparison with Monte Carlo simulations of a simple lattice model. It is shown that under typical conditions, as they are also present in experiments, only a rather weak stretching of the side chains is realized, and then the scaling predictions based on the extension of the Daoud-Cotton blob picture are not applicable.Also two-component bottle brush polymers are considered, where two types (A,B) of side chains are grafted, assuming that monomers of different kind repel each other. In this case, variable solvent quality is allowed for, such that for poor solvent conditions rather dense cylinder-like structures result. Theories predict “Janus Cylinder”-type phase separation along the backbone in this case. The Monte Carlo simulations, using the pruned-enriched Rosenbluth method (PERM) then are restricted to rather short side chain length. Nevertheless, evidence is obtained that the phase separation between an A-rich part of the cylindrical molecule and a B-rich part can only occur locally. The correlation length of this microphase separation can be controlled by the solvent quality. This lack of a phase transition is interpreted by an analogy with models for ferromagnets in one space dimension. ",0,1
"New high-resolution observations reveal that small-scale magnetic flux concentrations have a delicate substructure on a spatial scale of 0.1”. Its basic structure can be interpreted in terms of a magnetic flux sheet or tube that vertically extends through the ambient weak-field or field-free atmosphere with which it is in mechanical equilibrium. A more refined interpretation comes from new three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations that are capable of reproducing the corrugated shape of magnetic flux concentrations and their signature in the visible continuum. Furthermore it is shown that the characteristic asymmetric shape of the contrast profile of facular granules is an effect of radiative transfer across the rarefied atmosphere of the magnetic flux concentration. I also discuss three-dimensional radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the integral layers from the top of the convection zone to the mid-chromosphere. They show a highly dynamic chromospheric magnetic field, marked by rapidly moving filaments of stronger than average magnetic field that form in the compression zone downstream and along propagating shock fronts. The simulations confirm the picture of flux concentrations that strongly expand through the photosphere into a more homogeneous, space filling chromospheric field. Future directions in the simulation of small-scale magnetic fields are indicated by a few examples of very recent work. ",0,1
"The mean curvature flow describes the parabolic deformation of embedded branes in Riemannian geometry driven by their extrinsic mean curvature vector, which is typically associated to surface tension forces. It is the gradient flow of the area functional, and, as such, it is naturally identified with the boundary renormalization group equation of Dirichlet sigma models away from conformality, to lowest order in perturbation theory. D-branes appear as fixed points of this flow having conformally invariant boundary conditions. Simple running solutions include the paper-clip and the hair-pin (or grim-reaper) models on the plane, as well as scaling solutions associated to rational (p, q) closed curves and the decay of two intersecting lines. Stability analysis is performed in several cases while searching for transitions among different brane configurations. The combination of Ricci with the mean curvature flow is examined in detail together with several explicit examples of deforming curves on curved backgrounds. Some general aspects of the mean curvature flow in higher dimensional ambient spaces are also discussed and obtain consistent truncations to lower dimensional systems. Selected physical applications are mentioned in the text, including tachyon condensation in open string theory and the resistive diffusion of force-free fields in magneto-hydrodynamics. ",0,1
"Based on the fact that the underpotential electrochemical deposition of Ag atoms on the Au(100) surface exhibits sharp first-order phase transitions at well-defined values of the (coexistence) chemical potential (μ_coex), we performed extensive simulations aimed at investigating the hysteretic dynamic behavior of the system close to coexistence upon the application of a periodic signal of the form μ(t) = μ_coex + μ_osin(2Π t/τ), where μ_o and τ are the amplitude and the period of the sweep, respectively. For relatively short periods and small enough amplitudes the system becomes trapped either at low or high Ag coverage states, as evidenced by recording hysteresis loops. This scenario is identified as dynamically ordered states (DOS), such that the relaxation time (τ_relax) of the corresponding metastable state obeys τ_relax > τ. On the other hand, by properly increasing μ_o or/and τ, one finds that the Ag coverage gently follows the external drive (here τ_relax < τ) and the system is said to enter into dynamically disordered states (DDS), where hysteresis loops show almost symmetric limiting cycles. This symmetry breaking between limiting cycles driven by an external signal is discussed in terms of the concept of (out-of-equilibrium) Dynamic Phase Transitions between DOS and DDS, similar to those encountered when a magnetic system is placed in the presence of a variable external magnetic field. However, a careful finite-size scaling study reveals that, at least at T = 300K, the Ag/Au(100) system does not exhibit true second-order phase transitions but rather a crossover behavior between states. A diagram showing the location of the ordered and disordered states in the μ versus τ plane is obtained and discussed. ",0,1
"The dynamics of information dissemination in social networks is of paramount importance in processes such as rumors or fads propagation, spread of product innovations or 'word-of-mouth' communications. Due to the difficulty in tracking a specific information when it is transmitted by people, most understanding of information spreading in social networks comes from models or indirect measurements. Here we present an integrated experimental and theoretical framework to understand and quantitatively predict how and when information spreads over social networks. Using data collected in Viral Marketing campaigns that reached over 31,000 individuals in eleven European markets, we show the large degree of variability of the participants' actions, despite them being confronted with the common task of receiving and forwarding the same piece of information. This have a profound effect on information diffusion: Firstly, most of the transmission takes place due to super-spreading events which would be considered extraordinary in population-average models. Secondly, due to the different way individuals schedule information transmission we observe a slowing down of the spreading of information in social networks that happens in logarithmic time. Quantitative description of the experiments is possible through an stochastic branching process which corroborates the importance of heterogeneity. Since high variability of both the intensity and frequency of human responses are found in many other activities, our findings are pertinent to many other human driven diffusion processes like rumors, fads, innovations or news which has important consequences for organizations management, communications, marketing or electronic social communities.

"Using Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer Seyfert 1 and 1.2 data spanning 9 years, we study correlations between X-ray spectral features. The sample consists of 350 time-resolved spectra from 12 Seyfert 1 and 1.2 galaxies. Each spectrum is fitted to a model with an intrinsic powerlaw X-ray spectrum produced close to the central black hole that is reprocessed and absorbed by material around the black hole. To test the robustness of our results, we performed Monte Carlo simulations of the spectral sample. We find a complex relationship between the iron line equivalent width (EW) and the underlying power law index (Gamma). The data reveal a correlation between Gamma and EW which turns over at Gamma <2, but finds a weak anti-correlation for steeper photon indices. We propose that this relationship is driven by dilution of a disk spectrum (which includes the narrow iron line) by a beamed jet component and, hence, could be used as a diagnostic of jet-dominance. In addition, our sample shows a strong correlation between the reflection fraction (R) and Gamma, but we find that it is likely the result of modeling degeneracies. We also see the X-ray Baldwin effect (an anti-correlation between the 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity and EW) for the sample as a whole, but not for the individual galaxies and galaxy types. ",0,1
"A charge injection technique is applied to the X-ray CCD camera, XIS (X-ray Imaging Spectrometer) onboard Suzaku. The charge transfer inefficiency (CTI) in each CCD column (vertical transfer channel) is measured by the injection of charge packets into a transfer channel and subsequent readout. This paper reports the performances of the charge injection capability based on the ground experiments using a radiation damaged device, and in-orbit measurements of the XIS. The ground experiments show that charges are stably injected with the dispersion of 91eV in FWHM in a specific column for the charges equivalent to the X-ray energy of 5.1keV. This dispersion width is significantly smaller than that of the X-ray events of 113eV (FWHM) at approximately the same energy. The amount of charge loss during transfer in a specific column, which is measured with the charge injection capability, is consistent with that measured with the calibration source. These results indicate that the charge injection technique can accurately measure column-dependent charge losses rather than the calibration sources. The column-to-column CTI correction to the calibration source spectra significantly reduces the line widths compared to those with a column-averaged CTI correction (from 193eV to 173eV in FWHM on an average at the time of one year after the launch). In addition, this method significantly reduces the low energy tail in the line profile of the calibration source spectrum. ",0,1
"We describe the results of an extremely deep, 0.28 deg^2 survey for z = 3.1 Ly-alpha emission-line galaxies in the Extended Chandra Deep Field South. By using a narrow-band 5000 Anstrom filter and complementary broadband photometry from the MUSYC survey, we identify a statistically complete sample of 162 galaxies with monochromatic fluxes brighter than 1.5 x 10^-17 ergs cm^-2 s^-1 and observers frame equivalent widths greater than 80 Angstroms. We show that the equivalent width distribution of these objects follows an exponential with a rest-frame scale length of w_0 = 76 +/- 10 Angstroms. In addition, we show that in the emission line, the luminosity function of Ly-alpha galaxies has a faint-end power-law slope of alpha = -1.49 +/- 0.4, a bright-end cutoff of log L^* = 42.64 +/- 0.2, and a space density above our detection thresholds of 1.46 +/- 0.12 x 10^-3 h70^3 galaxies Mpc^-3. Finally, by comparing the emission-line and continuum properties of the LAEs, we show that the star-formation rates derived from Ly-alpha are3 times lower than those inferred from the rest-frame UV continuum. We use this offset to deduce the existence of a small amount of internal extinction within the host galaxies. This extinction, coupled with the lack of extremely-high equivalent width emitters, argues that these galaxies are not primordial Pop III objects, though they are young and relatively chemically unevolved.

"We obtained H-band polarimetric data of IRAS 19312+1950 using the near-infrared camera (CIAO) on the 8 m Subaru telescope. In order to investigate the physical properties of the central star and the nebula, we performed dust radiative transfer modeling and compared the model results with the observed spectral energy distributions (SEDs), the radial profiles of the total intensity image, and the fraction of linear polarization map. The total intensity image shows a nearly spherical core with3' radius, an S-shaped arm extending10' in the northwest to southeast direction, and an extended lobe towards the southwest. The polarization map shows a centro-symmetric vector alignment in almost the entire nebula and low polarizations along the S-shaped arm. These results suggest that the nebula is accompanied by a central star, and the S-shaped arm has a physically ring-like structure. From our radiative transfer modeling, we estimated the stellar temperature, the bolometric luminosity, and the current mass-loss rate to be 2800 K, 7000 L_sun, and 5.3x10^-6 M_sun yr^-1, respectively. Taking into account previous observational results, such as the detection of SiO maser emissions and silicate absorption feature in the 10 μm spectrum, our dust radiative transfer analysis based on our NIR imaging polarimetry suggests that (1) the central star of IRAS 19312+1950 is likely to be an oxygen-rich, dust-enshrouded AGB star and (2) most of the circumstellar material originates from other sources (e.g. ambient dark clouds) rather than as a result of mass loss from the central star.

"We report new magnetic field measurements for 14 classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs). We combine these data with one previous field determination in order to compare our observed field strengths with the field strengths predicted by magnetospheric accretion models. We use literature data on the stellar mass, radius, rotation period, and disk accretion rate to predict the field strength that should be present on each of our stars according to these magnetospheric accretion models. We show that our measured field values do not correlate with the field strengths predicted by simple magnetospheric accretion theory. We also use our field strength measurements and literature X-ray luminosity data to test a recent relationship expressing X-ray luminosity as a function of surface magnetic flux derived from various solar feature and main sequence star measurements. We find that the T Tauri stars we have observed have weaker than expected X-ray emission by over an order of magnitude on average using this relationship. We suggest the cause for this is actually a result of the very strong fields on these stars which decreases the efficiency with which gas motions in the photosphere can tangle magnetic flux tubes in the corona.

"As a first step to analyze the electromagnetic meson production reactions in the nucleon resonance region, the parameters of the hadronic interactions of a dynamical coupled-channel model, developed in Physics Reports 439, 193 (2007), are determined by fitting the π N scattering data. The channels included in the calculations are π N, η N and ππ N which has πΔ, ρ N, and σ N resonant components. The non-resonant meson-baryon interactions of the model are derived from a set of Lagrangians by using a unitary transformation method. One or two bare excited nucleon states in each of S, P, D, and F partial waves are included to generate the resonant amplitudes in the fits. The parameters of the model are first determined by fitting as much as possible the empirical π N elastic scattering amplitudes of SAID up to 2 GeV. We then refine and confirm the resulting parameters by directly comparing the predicted differential cross section and target polarization asymmetry with the original data of the elastic π^± p →π^± p and charge-exchange π^- p →π^0 n processes. The predicted total cross sections of π N reactions and π N→η N reactions are also in good agreement with the data. Applications of the constructed model in analyzing the electromagnetic meson production data as well as the future developments are discussed. ",0,1
"We find three distinct phases; a tubular phase, a planar phase, and the spherical phase, in a triangulated fluid surface model. It is also found that these phases are separated by discontinuous transitions. The fluid surface model is investigated within the framework of the conventional curvature model by using the canonical Monte Carlo simulations with dynamical triangulations. The mechanical strength of the surface is given only by skeletons, and no two-dimensional bending energy is assumed in the Hamiltonian. The skeletons are composed of elastic linear-chains and rigid junctions and form a compartmentalized structure on the surface, and for this reason the vertices of triangles can diffuse freely only inside the compartments. As a consequence, an inhomogeneous structure is introduced in the model; the surface strength inside the compartments is different from the surface strength on the compartments. However, the rotational symmetry is not influenced by the elastic skeletons; there is no specific direction on the surface. In addition to the three phases mentioned above, a collapsed phase is expected to exist in the low bending rigidity regime that was not studied here. The inhomogeneous structure and the fluidity of vertices are considered to be the origin of such variety of phases. ",0,1
"It remains an open question how magnetic energy is rapidly released in the solar corona so as to create solar explosions such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Recent studies have confirmed that a system consisting of a flux rope embedded in a background field exhibits a catastrophic behavior, and the energy threshold at the catastrophic point may exceed the associated open field energy. The accumulated free energy in the corona is abruptly released when the catastrophe takes place, and it probably serves as the main means of energy release for CMEs at least in the initial phase. Such a release proceeds via an ideal MHD process in contrast with nonideal ones such as magnetic reconnection. The catastrophe results in a sudden formation of electric current sheets, which naturally provide proper sites for fast magnetic reconnection. The reconnection may be identified with a solar flare associated with the CME on one hand, and produces a further acceleration of the CME on the other. On this basis, several preliminary suggestions are made for future observational investigations, especially with the proposed KuaFu satellites, on the roles of the MHD catastrophe and magnetic reconnection in the magnetic energy release associated with CMEs and flares.

"The performance of telescope systems working at microwave or visible/IR wavelengths is typically described in terms of different parameters according to the wavelength range. Most commercial ray tracing packages have been specifically designed for use with visible/IR systems and thus, though very flexible and sophisticated, do not provide the appropriate parameters to fully describe microwave antennas, and thus to compare with specifications. In this work we demonstrate that the Strehl ratio is equal to the phase efficiency when the apodization factor is taken into account. The phase efficiency is the most critical contribution to the aperture efficiency of an antenna, and the most difficult parameter to optimize during the telescope design. The equivalence between the Strehl ratio and the phase efficiency gives the designer/user of the telescope the opportunity to use the faster commercial ray-tracing software to optimize the design. We also discuss the results of several tests performed to check the validity of this relationship that we carried out using a ray-tracing software, ZEMAX and a full Physical Optics software, GRASP9.3, applied to three different telescope designs that span a factor of ≃ 10 in terms of D/lambda. The maximum measured discrepancy between phase efficiency and Strehl ratio varies between≃0.4 and 1.9 up to an offset angle of >40 beams, depending on the optical configuration, but it is always less than 0.5 where the Strehl ratio is >0.95.

"We outline a dynamical dark energy scenario whose signatures may be simultaneously tested by astronomical observations and laboratory experiments. The dark energy is a field with slightly sub-gravitational couplings to matter, a logarithmic self-interaction potential with a scale tuned to ∼ 10^-3 eV, as is usual in quintessence models, and an effective mass m_ϕ influenced by the environmental energy density. Its forces may be suppressed just below the current bounds by the chameleon-like mimicry, whereby only outer layers of mass distributions, of thickness 1/m_ϕ, give off appreciable long range forces. After inflation and reheating, the field is relativistic, and attains a Planckian expectation value before Hubble friction freezes it. This can make gravity in space slightly stronger than on Earth. During the matter era, interactions with nonrelativistic matter dig a minimum close to the Planck scale. However, due to its sub-gravitational matter couplings the field will linger away from this minimum until the matter energy density dips below ∼ 10^-12 eV^4. Then it starts to roll to the minimum, driving a period of cosmic acceleration. Among the signatures of this scenario may be dark energy equation of state w-1, stronger gravity in dilute mediums, that may influence BBN and appear as an excess of dark matter, and sub-millimeter corrections to Newton's law, close to the present laboratory limits.

"The triplet and singlet low-energy parameters in the effective-range expansion for neutron–proton scattering are determined by using the latest experimental data on respective phase shifts from the SAID nucleon–nucleon database. The results differ markedly from the analogous parameters obtained on the basis of the phase shifts of the Nijmegen group and contradict the parameter values that are presently used as experimental ones. The values found with the aid of the phase shifts from the SAID nucleon–nucleon database for the total cross section for the scattering of zero-energy neutrons by protons, σ_0=20.426b, and the neutron–proton coherent scattering length, f=-3.755fm, agree perfectly with the experimental cross-section values obtained by Houk, σ_0=20.436± 0.023b, and experimental scattering-length values obtained by Houk and Wilson, f=-3.756± 0.009fm, but they contradict cross-section values of σ_0=20.491± 0.014b according to Dilg and coherent-scattering-length values of f=-3.7409± 0.0011fm according to Koester and Nistler.

"We report on HST/ACS photometry of the rich intermediate-age star cluster NGC 1846 in the Large Magellanic Cloud, which clearly reveals the presence of a double main sequence turn-off in this object. Despite this, the main sequence, sub-giant branch, and red giant branch are all narrow and well-defined, and the red clump is compact. We examine the spatial distribution of turn-off stars and demonstrate that all belong to NGC 1846 rather than to any field star population. In addition, the spatial distributions of the two sets of turn-off stars may exhibit different central concentrations and some asymmetries. By fitting isochrones, we show that the properties of the colour-magnitude diagram can be explained if there are two stellar populations of equivalent metal abundance in NGC 1846, differing in age by approximately 300 Myr. The absolute ages of the two populations are1.9 and2.2 Gyr, although there may be a systematic error of up to +/-0.4 Gyr in these values. The metal abundance inferred from isochrone fitting is [M/H]-0.40, consistent with spectroscopic measurements of [Fe/H]. We propose that the observed properties of NGC 1846 can be explained if this object originated via the tidal capture of two star clusters formed separately in a star cluster group in a single giant molecular cloud. This scenario accounts naturally for the age difference and uniform metallicity of the two member populations, as well as the differences in their spatial distributions. ",0,1
"H-index, proposed by Hirsch is a good indicator of the impact of a scientist's research. When evaluating departments, institutions or labs, the importance of h-index can be further enhanced when properly calibrated for size. Particularly acute is the issue of federally funded facilities whose number of actively publishing scientists frequently dwarfs that of academic departments. Recently Molinari and Molinari developed a methodology that shows the h-index has a universal growth rate for large numbers of papers, allowing for meaningful comparisons between institutions.An additional challenge when comparing large institutions is that fields have distinct internal cultures, with different typical rates of publication and citation; biology is more highly cited than physics, which is more highly cited than engineering. For this reason, this study has focused on the physical sciences, engineering, and technology, and has excluded bio-medical research. Comparisons between individual disciplines are reported here to provide contextual framework. Generally, it was found that the universal growth rate of Molinari and Molinari holds well across all the categories considered, testifying to the robustness of both their growth law and our results.The overall goal here is to set the highest standard of comparison for federal investment in science; comparisons are made with the nations preeminent private and public institutions. We find that many among the national facilities compare favorably in research impact with the nations leading universities. ",0,1
"Disclinations, first observed in mesomorphic phases, are relevant to a number of ill-ordered condensed matter media, with continuous symmetries or frustrated order. They also appear in polycrystals at the edges of grain boundaries. They are of limited interest in solid single crystals, where, owing to their large elastic stresses, they mostly appear in close pairs of opposite signs. The relaxation mechanisms associated with a disclination in its creation, motion, change of shape, involve an interplay with continuous or quantized dislocations and/or continuous disclinations. These are attached to the disclinations or are akin to Nye's dislocation densities, well suited here. The notion of 'extended Volterra process' takes these relaxation processes into account and covers different situations where this interplay takes place. These concepts are illustrated by applications in amorphous solids, mesomorphic phases and frustrated media in their curved habit space. The powerful topological theory of line defects only considers defects stable against relaxation processes compatible with the structure considered. It can be seen as a simplified case of the approach considered here, well suited for media of high plasticity or/and complex structures. Topological stability cannot guarantee energetic stability and sometimes cannot distinguish finer details of structure of defects. ",0,1
"Let S be a surface of finite type which is not a sphere with at most four punctures, a torus with at most two punctures, or a closed surface of genus two. Let ℳℱ be the space of equivalence classes of measured foliations of compact support on S and let 𝒰ℳℱ be the quotient space of ℳℱ obtained by identifying two equivalence classes whenever they can be represented by topologically equivalent foliations, that is, forgetting the transverse measure. The extended mapping class group Γ^* of S acts as by homeomorphisms of 𝒰ℳℱ. We show that the restriction of the action of the whole homeomorphism group of 𝒰ℳℱ on some dense subset of 𝒰ℳℱ coincides with the action of Γ^* on that subset. More precisely, let 𝒟 be the natural image in 𝒰ℳℱ of the set of homotopy classes of not necessarily connected essential disjoint and pairwise nonhomotopic simple closed curves on S. The set 𝒟 is dense in 𝒰ℳℱ, it is invariant by the action of Γ^* on 𝒰ℳℱ and the restriction of the action of Γ^* on 𝒟 is faithful. We prove that the restriction of the action on 𝒟 of the group Homeo(𝒰ℳℱ) coincides with the action of Γ^*(S) on that subspace. ",0,1
"In this paper we first construct a mathematical model for the Universe expansion that started up with the original Big Bang. Next, we discuss the problematic of the mechanical and physical laws invariance regarding the spatial frame exchanges. We then prove the (theoretical) existence of a variable metric g_t, depending on time and satisfying to a simplified Einstein equation, so that all free ordinary trajectories are geodesics. This is done by considering the classical Galileo-Newtonian space and time relation, by using generalized Newtonian principles and adding the approved physical new ones (as covariance principle, Mach principle, the Einstein equivalence principle ...) in order to establish a new cosmological model of the dynamical Universe as being (U(t))_t≥ 0=(B_e(O,t),g_t)_t≥ 0, where B_e(O,t) is the Euclidean ball of radius t in ℝ^3. The cosmological metric g_t is totally determined, at time t, by the mass energy distribution E_t(X) on B_e(O,t). We study also the black holes phenomenon and we prove that the total and global cosmological energy distribution E_t(X) satisfies to the wave equation whose solutions are characterized by pseudo-frequencies depending on time and related to the spectrum of the Dirichlet problem on the unit ball B_e(O,1) for the Laplace-Beltrami operator -Δ. Our model is consistent in the sense that all Newtonian and classical physical laws are valid as particular cases in classical situations. Then, we show that all basic results of Modern Physics are still valid without using the second postulate of special relativity nor the uncertainty principle. ",0,1
"We study the non-equilibrium relaxation of an elastic line described by the Edwards-Wilkinson equation. Although this model is the simplest representation of interface dynamics, we highlight that many (not though all) important aspects of the non-equilibrium relaxation of elastic manifolds are already present in such quadratic and clean systems. We analyze in detail the aging behaviour of several two-times averaged and fluctuating observables taking into account finite-size effects and the crossover to the stationary and equilibrium regimes. We start by investigating the structure factor and extracting from its decay a growing correlation length. We present the full two-times and size dependence of the interface roughness and we generalize the Family-Vicsek scaling form to non-equilibrium situations. We compute the incoherent cattering function and we compare it to the one measured in other glassy systems. We analyse the response functions, the violation of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem in the aging regime, and its crossover to the equilibrium relation in the stationary regime. Finally, we study the out-of-equilibrium fluctuations of the previously studied two-times functions and we characterize the scaling properties of their probability distribution functions. Our results allow us to obtain new insights into other glassy problems such as the aging behavior in colloidal glasses and vortex glasses. ",0,1
"We discuss Kondo behavior of a conduction electron system coupled with local optical phonon by analyzing the Anderson-Holstein model with the use of a numerical renormalization group (NRG) method. There appear three typical regions due to the balance between Coulomb interaction U_ ee and phonon-mediated attraction U_ ph. For U_ ee>U_ ph, we observe the standard Kondo effect concerning spin degree of freedom. Since the Coulomb interaction is effectively reduced as U_ ee-U_ ph, the Kondo temperature T_ K is increased when U_ ph is increased. On the other hand, for U_ ee<U_ ph, there occurs the Kondo effect concerning charge degree of freedom, since vacant and double occupied states play roles of pseudo-spins. Note that in this case, T_ K is decreased with the increase of U_ ph. Namely, T_ K should be maximized for U_ ee≈ U_ ph. Then, we analyze in detail the Kondo behavior at U_ ee=U_ ph, which is found to be explained by the polaron Anderson model with reduced hybridization of polaron and residual repulsive interaction among polarons. By comparing the NRG results of the polaron Anderson model with those of the original Anderson-Holstein model, we clarify the Kondo behavior in the competing region of U_ ee≈ U_ ph. ",0,1
"The high volume of packets and packet rates of traffic on some router links makes it exceedingly difficult for routers to examine every packet in order to keep detailed statistics about the traffic which is traversing the router. Sampling is commonly applied on routers in order to limit the load incurred by the collection of information that the router has to undertake when evaluating flow information for monitoring purposes. The sampling process in nearly all cases is a deterministic process of choosing 1 in every N packets on a per-interface basis, and then forming the flow statistics based on the collected sampled statistics. Even though this sampling may not be significant for some statistics, such as packet rate, others can be severely distorted. However, it is important to consider the sampling techniques and their relative accuracy when applied to different traffic patterns. The main disadvantage of sampling is the loss of accuracy in the collected trace when compared to the original traffic stream. To date there has not been a detailed analysis of the impact of sampling at a router in various traffic profiles and flow criteria. In this paper, we assess the performance of the sampling process as used in NetFlow in detail, and we discuss some techniques for the compensation of loss of monitoring detail. ",0,1
"We present an original method of digitizing and astrometrically reducing 'Carte du Ciel' plate material using an inexpensive flatbed scanner, to demonstrate that for this material there is an alternative to more specialized measuring machines that are very few in number and thus not readily available. The sample of plates chosen to develop this method are original 'Carte du Ciel' plates of the San Fernando zone, photographic material with a mean epoch 1903.6, and a limiting photographic magnitude14.5, covering the declination range of -10 < dec < -2. Digitization has been made using a commercial flatbed scanner, demonstrating the internal precision that can be attained with such a device. A variety of post-scan corrections are shown to be necessary. In particular, the large distortion introduced by the non-uniform action of the scanner is modelled using multiple scans of each plate. We also tackle the specific problems associated with the triple-exposure images on some plates and the grid lines present on all. The final measures are reduced to celestial coordinates using the Tycho-2 Catalogue. The internal precision obtained over a single plate, 3microns0.18' in each axis, is comparable to what is realized with similar plate material using slower, less affordable, and less widely available conventional measuring machines, such as a PDS microdensitometer. The accuracy attained over large multi-plate areas, employing an overlapping plate technique, is estimated at 0.2'. ",0,1
"We present the first results for effective-one-body (EOB) waveforms that are faithful to numerical relativity simulations over an entire inspiral, merger and ringdown phase of binary black hole systems with mass ratios q = m1/m2 as low as 1/10.We use EOB theory in conjunction with fits to numerical-relativity data to construct accurate templates for gravitational waves emitted by such systems. The resulting template bank is used to search for signals from these sources using LIGO's second observing run data. Our analysis shows that this new class of EOB waveforms can be used to detect binary black holes out to redshifts z5 at design sensitivity of Advanced LIGO/VIRGO detectors. This represents a significant improvement compared to previous searches based on post-Newtonian approximations or phenomenological models.The detection rate of binary black holes predicted by our analysis agrees well with current estimates obtained within the standard ΛCDM cosmology model.",1,0
"We propose to cool fermionic atoms in optical lattices by using the pairing mechanism between two different hyperfine states, which is analogous to Cooper pair formation in superconductors. We show that this method can be used for both bosonic and fermionic systems with attractive interactions. The proposed scheme has several advantages over other methods such as evaporative cooling or sympathetic cooling.It does not require any additional laser beams besides those needed for trapping and manipulating cold atoms. In addition it works even when there are no free particles present initially (e.g., at zero temperature). Finally we discuss how our proposal could be realized experimentally. Cooling fermions down to quantum degeneracy temperatures below 1 microkelvin remains one of the most challenging problems in atomic physics today [1] . This problem becomes particularly difficult if the initial number density of fermions is high because then elastic collisions cannot remove enough energy from the system [2] . In recent years, however, new experimental techniques have been developed [3, 4] , allowing us to trap and manipulate cold atoms on an unprecedented level [5] . These developments make it possible to study many-body phenomena [6] like superfluidity [7, 8] and Bose-Einstein condensation [9] in ultracold atomic gases. One important goal in these experiments is to reach quantum degenerate regimes where the gas consists of strongly interacting fermions [10] . However, reaching low temperatures requires efficient cooling schemes [11] . One promising approach towards achieving this goal is to use the pairing mechanism [12] . Pairs of fermions form bound states called Cooper pairs in conventional superconductors [13] . Analogously, pairs of fermions may also form bound states in ultracold atomic clouds [14] . If the interaction strength between fermions is sufficiently large, they will preferentially bind into pairs rather than remaining unpaired [15] . Therefore, cooling fermions via pairing should work well even",1,0
"We use hydrodynamic simulations to study how proto-clusters grow and evolve into galaxy clusters, focusing on their baryon content at high redshifts (z > 5). We find that most of these regions are highly ionized by z = 3 due to photo-heating by UV background radiation. The resulting low neutral hydrogen fraction leads to an under-density of absorbers along the line-of-sight towards such objects compared with lower redshift observations. This effect is more pronounced for higher mass halos which have larger gas fractions than less massive ones. Using this result we derive constraints on the abundance of high-redshift proto-clusters as a function of halo mass. These results can be used to test models of structure formation and reionization. In addition they provide useful input parameters for future studies of cluster scaling relations using weak lensing techniques.Keywords: Hydrogen ionization state, Galaxy Cluster, Reionization",1,0
"We present an analysis of the evolution of early-type galaxies (ETGs) in hydrodynamical cosmological simulations, focusing on their formation history as well as their internal structure at z = 0. We find that ETG progenitors are typically gas-rich systems with high star formation rates (SFRs), which evolve into red-sequence objects through dry mergers. In addition to this major merger channel for forming ETGs, we show that minor mergers can also contribute significantly to the growth of massive ETGs by bringing in fresh cold gas. Our results suggest that both processes play important roles in shaping the observed properties of local ETGs. This is consistent with recent observational studies showing that most massive ETGs have experienced multiple episodes of merging over cosmic time.Keywords: galaxy evolution, galaxy morphology, galaxy scaling relations, galaxy clusters, semi-analytic models, hydrodynamics, dark matter",1,0

"We present new exact solutions to the Einstein field equations for stationary axisymmetric spacetimes with two commuting Killing vectors, which are generated by applying nonholonomic frame transforms (NFT) to known vacuum solutions. The NFT is constructed using an ansatz for the metric coefficients that depends on one arbitrary function of the radial coordinate only. We show how this method can be used to generate families of black hole solutions with different horizon topologies. In particular we find new rotating black ring solutions with toroidal horizons. These solutions have been obtained previously as limits of static black rings but our approach allows us to obtain them directly without any additional assumptions or approximations. Finally, we discuss some open problems related to these results. PACS numbers: 04.20.-q, 11.10.-z, 98.80.CqI. INTRODUCTORY REMARkS The study of exact solutions to the Einstein equations has played a crucial role in understanding many aspects of general relativity. However, it is often difficult to construct such solutions because they require solving complicated nonlinear partial differential equations. This problem becomes even more challenging when considering physically interesting situations like those involving rotation and/or matter fields. Nevertheless, there exist several techniques that allow one to generate new classes of solutions starting from simpler ones. One of the most powerful methods involves transforming the original solution into another one via so-called nonholonomic frame transforms [1] . Such transformations preserve certain geometric properties of the spacetime while changing others; see [2] - [4] for reviews. For example, if the transformed solution satisfies the vacuum Einstein equations then so does the original one [5] . In this work we apply nonholonomic frame transforms to known vacuum solutions of the Einstein equations in order to generate new exact solutions describing stationary axisymmetric spacetimes: i.e., spacetimes admitting at least two independent Killing vector fields whose orbits are closed curves [6] . Stationary axisymmetric spacetimes play an important role in astrophysics since they describe the exterior gravitational field of spinning objects like stars, planets, and black holes [7, 8]",1,0

"We report the discovery of transient dust emission at mid-infrared wavelengths (5-20 microns) in two elliptical galaxies with active galactic nuclei (AGN). The observations were made using Spitzer Space Telescope's Infrared Array Camera and Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer instruments over a period of several years. We find that the infrared luminosity is consistent with heating by AGN radiation or supernovae remnants within the central kpc region. This suggests that recent feedback energy release has been occurring in these cores. These results are important because they provide new evidence on how supermassive black holes grow through accretion onto their host galaxy centers. They also demonstrate the power of combining multiwavelength data to study the physical processes associated with nuclear activity.Keywords: Active galactic nucleus, Galaxy evolution, Mid-infrared, Nuclear starbursts1. IntroductionSupermassive black holes reside in the center of most massive galaxies. Their growth is thought to be fueled by gas inflow driven by gravitational torques produced during mergers and/or interactions between galaxies (BarnesHernquist 1996; Hopkins et al. 2006) . However, it remains unclear what happens after this fuel supply runs out. One possibility is that the black hole continues growing via radiatively inefficient accretion flows (NarayanYi 1994) , which may produce powerful winds and jets that can drive large-scale outflows into the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM) (SilkRees 1998; Di Matteo et al. 2005 ). Another possibility is that the black holes become dormant as the ISM becomes too hot to cool efficiently (Bower et al. 2006; Croton et al. 2006 ) until another merger event triggers renewed activity. Understanding the mechanisms responsible for shutting off black-hole growth will help us understand why some galaxies have large black holes while others do not.2. Previous WorkSeveral studies have shown that there exists an anti-correlation between the mass of the central supermassive black hole and the stellar velocity dispersion of its host galaxy bulge (Ferrar",1,0
"We present new Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Survey (ACS) coronagraphic observations in visible light and near-infrared wavelengths that reveal an extended dusty disk surrounding the Herbig Ae star HD 100546, which is known to harbor a protoplanetary disk with spiral arms. The ACS coronagraph was used to block out direct stellar radiation at small angular separations from the central star while allowing us to detect scattered light from circumstellar material located farther away. We find evidence for two bright rings of emission separated by0.5′′ along the major axis of the disk. These features are most likely due to scattering off large grains or planetesimals orbiting close to their parent stars.In addition, we have detected several dark gaps within these bright rings as well as fainter structures extending outward into the outer regions of the disk. Our results suggest that this system may be undergoing planet formation through gravitational interactions between larger bodies such as planets and/or planetesimals.",1,0
"We report on high-resolution observations with Herschel PACS (Poglitsch et al., 2010) and SPIRE (Griffin et al., 2010 ) that reveal for the first time the presence of cold dust emission at temperatures as low as T = 20 K in two nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), Arp220 and Mrk 231. The observed fluxes are consistent with predictions based on models of starbursts heated by young stars. We find evidence for an additional component of cooler dust which is likely to be associated with the obscured AGN activity present in these objects. In addition we have detected the [CII] 158 µm line in both sources using PACS spectroscopy. This allows us to estimate the total mass of warm molecular hydrogen M(H2).

"We present an accurate analytical model for the description of optical precursors in ultrashort laser pulses propagating through dispersive media, which is based on the concept of nonlinear phase modulation by self-phase-modulation (SPM) and cross-phase-modulation (XPM). The proposed approach allows us to describe accurately both the temporal shape as well as the spectral content of these phenomena. We show that this new method can be used to predict the appearance of weak-field coherent optical transience (WFCOT), i.e., the generation of sub-femtosecond bursts of light with high peak power at specific wavelengths within the spectrum of the pulse. This prediction is confirmed experimentally using a Ti:Sapphire femtosecond oscillator operating at 800 nm central wavelength. Finally we demonstrate how our results are relevant for applications such as ultrafast spectroscopy or attosecond science.Optical precursors have been observed since the early days of ultrafast optics [1–3] . They appear when short intense laser pulses propagate through dispersive media like glass fibers [4] , air [5] , water [6] , crystals [7, 8] , etc.. These effects were first explained theoretically by assuming that the propagation of the pulse was governed by the slowly varying envelope approximation [9] . However it has recently become clear that this assumption does not hold true anymore if one wants to explain the details of the experimental observations [10–12] .In order to overcome this limitation several authors have developed more sophisticated models [13–19] . In particular, the so-called generalized nonlinear Schrödinger equation (GNLSE) [20, 21] has proven very useful because it takes into account all orders of dispersion [22] , self-steepening [23] , third-order dispersion [24] , Raman scattering [25] , stimulated Brillouin scattering [26] , self-frequency shift [27] , plasma defocusing [28] , gain saturation [29] , and other higher-order effects [30] .However, despite its successes, there still remain some discrepancies between theory and experiment [31] . For example, the GNLSE predicts that the intensity profile of the precursor should always exhibit a smooth bell-shaped structure [32]",1,0
"We present an exact quantum-mechanical treatment for the dynamics of open systems in which the system is coupled to many harmonic oscillators representing its surrounding environment.We show that, under certain conditions, this model can be reduced exactly into a master equation with Lindblad form. The resulting master equations are used to study the effects of environmental fluctuations on the evolution of the density matrix describing the state of the system. In particular we consider two different models of environments corresponding to Ohmic dissipation and spin-boson interaction respectively. For both cases it is shown how the effect of the environment leads to irreversible loss of information about the initial state of the system as well as to thermalization at late times. Finally, we discuss possible applications of our results to problems such as transport through mesoscopic conductors or dissipative tunneling between localized states in disordered solids. Decoherence and relaxation processes play a crucial role in understanding the physics of open quantum systems [1, 2] . These phenomena arise when the system interacts with some external degrees of freedom (environment) whose influence cannot be neglected [3] . In recent years there has been considerable interest in developing theoretical methods capable of treating these effects beyond the perturbative regime [4] . A number of approaches have been proposed ranging from phenomenological treatments based on stochastic Schrödinger equations [5] , to more microscopic descriptions using path integral techniques [6] or field-theoretical formulations [7, 8] . However, despite their successes, all these methods suffer from one common drawback: they do not provide any insight into the underlying physical mechanisms responsible for decoherence and relaxation; nor do they allow us to make quantitative predictions regarding the time scales involved [9] . Recently, several authors [10 -12] have suggested that the problem may be tackled within the framework of quantum mechanics itself. This idea was first put forward by Feynman [13] who showed that the statistical properties of macroscopic objects could be obtained by averaging over an ensemble of identical but microscopically distinct realizations of the same experiment. More recently, Leggett [14] introduced a method...",1,0
"We present an algorithm to construct the reduced basis space in the context of nonlinear problems with multiple solutions, which is based on the concept of quasi-equilibrium grid (QEG). The QEG method was originally developed by Simo and Armero as a numerical technique for solving rate-independent processes such as plasticity or damage mechanics. We show that this approach can be used to generate snapshots for constructing the reduced basis spaces associated with nonlinear problems with multiple solutions. In particular, we consider two examples arising from structural dynamics and fluid flow computations. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed method yields accurate approximations at significantly lower computational cost than existing approaches. Keywords: Reduced Basis Method; Quasi-Equilibrium Grids; Nonlinear Problems; Model Order Reduction; Geometric Construction; Snapshot Generation. 1 Introduction. The goal of this work is to develop efficient algorithms for generating snapshots for constructing the RB spaces associated with nonlinear problems having multiple solutions. This problem arises frequently when one solves engineering applications involving complex physical phenomena such as multiphysics coupling, material failure, contact/impact, etc.. For example, in structural dynamics, it may happen that different initial conditions lead to different equilibrium states [19, 20] . Similarly, in fluid flows, there are often many steady-state solutions corresponding to different boundary conditions [7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18] . In order to solve these types of problems efficiently using the reduced basis method (RBM), it is necessary to have a good set of snapshots representing all possible solution behaviors. However, since each snapshot corresponds to a specific solution behavior, it is not easy to obtain them directly through standard finite element analysis. Therefore, various techniques have been developed over the past decade to overcome this difficulty [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40",1,0
"We study the cosmological evolution in regular homogeneous T-models filled by a perfect fluid and a vacuum energy density term, which is responsible for an accelerated expansion at late times.We find that this model can be described as a mixture between dust matter (dark matter) and radiation-like components. The latter component behaves like a relativistic gas whose pressure decreases more slowly than its energy density does. This leads to a negative effective equation-of-state parameter w eff < 0 during most of the cosmic history. However, we show that there exists a time interval where w eff > -1, so that our model cannot explain the current acceleration of the universe without introducing additional ingredients such as quintessence or modified gravity theories. Nevertheless, it may provide useful insights into the nature of dark energy. In addition, we discuss how the presence of a non-vanishing vacuum energy density affects the growth rate of structure formation on sub-horizon scales.",1,0
"We study the possibility that black holes can be retained in binary systems by gravitational radiation reaction even if their initial velocities are very large, and we find that this is possible for certain ranges of parameters.We consider two types of binaries:those consisting of one black hole and another compact object (such as neutron star or white dwarf), and those consisting of two black holes.In both cases, we show how to calculate the final velocity after emission of gravitational waves using post-Newtonian approximations up to third order.For binaries containing at least one black hole, we also use numerical relativity simulations to check our results.Finally, we discuss some astrophysical implications of these findings. The discovery of gravitational waves has opened an exciting new window on the universe [1] . One of its most surprising features was the detection of merging black holes [2] , which were found to have masses ranging between about 4M☉ and 36M☉ [3] . This raises the question whether there exist other ways besides mergers through which black holes may form [4] . In particular, it would be interesting to know what happens when a black hole moves into a binary system composed of either another black hole or a nonblack-hole companion [5] . If the black hole's initial speed is too high, then it will escape the system before emitting enough energy via gravitational waves [6] . However, if the black hole starts out slowly but still faster than the orbital speed of the binary components, then it could potentially be captured [7, 8] .Here, we investigate this scenario further and determine under which conditions such capture is indeed possible.",1,0
"We report on near-infrared observations of an extremely red, faint source in the field of view of the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2). The source is located at RA = 03h45m55s and Dec = -05d20'00' (J2000), about 1 arcmin south-east of the open cluster NGC 6231. It was detected by WFPC2 as a point-like object with mF606W26 mag., mF814W25 mag. (Vega system) and mH20 mag.. We have obtained additional photometry for this object using the ESO NTT telescope equipped with SOFI camera. Our results show that it has very red colors (R-I > 5 mag.) and its spectrum exhibits strong absorption features characteristic of late-type stars. Its absolute magnitude M(K) = -4.3 ± 0.1 suggests that we are dealing with either a brown dwarf or a low-mass star.",1,0
"We present an analysis of gene duplication models in the context of evolving regulatory networks, and show that they are not sufficient to explain all observed features of these networks. We consider two types of duplications: whole-genome duplicates (WGDs) and local duplicates (LDs). WGDs occur when a complete genome is duplicated; LDs occur when only one or few genes are duplicated at once.In both cases we study how new duplicate copies evolve after their creation by comparing them with their parent copy using sequence similarity measures. For each type of duplication event, we find that there exists a large number of duplicates which do not resemble any other existing gene more than expected under random chance. This suggests that many duplicates may be created through mechanisms different from those considered here. Furthermore, we observe that duplicates tend to have higher expression levels compared to non-duplicates. Finally, we compare our results on duplicates with previous studies on network evolution, and discuss possible extensions of this work.",1,0
"We study spheroidal and torsional normal modes of quasi-static shear oscillations in the spherical shell model with incompressible liquid core, which is used to describe the dynamics of superfluid neutron stars. We show that there are two types of spheroidal modes: one type corresponds to the usual fluid-like mode, while another type describes the motion of the whole star as a rigid body. The latter type can be excited only by external perturbations. In addition we find three new families of torsional modes corresponding to different motions of the inner core. These results may have important implications for understanding the observed phenomena related to the glitch activity of pulsars.Keywords: Quasi-static shear oscillations; Spherical shell model; Superfluidity of neutrons; Pulsar glitches; Torsional waves; Rigid-body rotation; Neutron stars; Nuclear matter; Energy density functional theory",1,0
"We study the advantages and disadvantages of composite Higgs models in four dimensions (4D) versus five dimensions (5D). In 4D, we find that there are two types of composite Higgs models with different phenomenological consequences. The first type is based on an underlying global symmetry group SU(2)L ×SU(2)R ×U(1)B−L which leads to three Goldstone bosons after spontaneous breaking of this symmetry down to U(1)EM . This model has been studied extensively by many authors including ourselves [1–3] . The second type is based on an extended gauge symmetry group SU(3)C ×SU(2)L ×U(1)Y ×Z′ where Z′ is a new abelian gauge factor associated with extra spatial dimension [4–6] . We show that both these models can be embedded into 5D theories compactified on orbifolds [7–9] , but they have very different properties when considered as effective 4D theories.",1,0
"We study the problem of finding an explicit formula for the dimension of the space spanned by all vectors in a given finite set S whose Schatten p-norms are bounded above by some constant C, where 1<p<∞ is fixed and p>2.We show that this dimension can be expressed as a polynomial in C^1/p (and hence also in the cardinality of S) if we assume that S has no two elements which are orthogonal under any inner product on ℂ^n.This result generalizes earlier results obtained independently by M. Lustig and A. Shub and by J. Bourgain and G. Bouschler. It should be noted that our proof does not use the fact that the underlying field is complex; it works over arbitrary fields of characteristic zero. The main ingredient of our argument is a new combinatorial identity involving binomial coefficients.",1,0
"In this article we study the structure of smooth foliations on closed manifolds, which are given by submersions whose fibers have only Morse singularities (i.e., they look like graphs over their tangent spaces). We prove that such foliations can be approximated in the C 1 -topology by regular ones and give an explicit bound for the approximation error. This result is used to show that any leafwise Riemannian metric on these foliations has bounded geometry. The main tool here is the theory of harmonic maps into Hilbert spaces developed by Eells-Elworthy-Malliavin. In particular, we use the fact that every harmonic map into a Hilbert space is weakly conformal. As another application of our results, we obtain some estimates for the volume growth rate along leaves of such foliations. Finally, using the above mentioned bounds for the approximation error, we also get lower bounds for the number of critical points of generic functions on closed manifolds.",1,0
"We present the results on charmless three-body decays of B mesons using data collected by the Belle experiment at KEKB in 2003-2007, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 711 fb-1. We measure branching fractions for the decay modes B+ -> J/psi K*(892)0 and B- -> J/psi K*0(1430), where J/psi is reconstructed in its decay into muon pairs.The measured values areB+ -> J/psi: (4.6 +/- 0.7 +/- 1.1) x 10^-6; B->J/psi: (3.2 +/- 0.5 +/- 0.9) x 10^-6 , where the first errors are statistical and systematic respectively, and the second error is due to uncertainty in the number of BB events. These measurements are consistent with previous measurements but have improved precision. In addition we report new upper limits on the branching fraction for the decay mode B+ -> J/psi/phi .",1,0
"We present constraints on models of neutrino mass, mixing angles, and interactions using data from the Planck satellite experiment. We use measurements of the cosmic microwave background temperature anisotropy power spectrum to constrain cosmological parameters including the sum of the masses of all three active neutrinos ( m ), the effective number of relativistic species at recombination (), and the primordial helium abundance (). The results are consistent with previous analyses but have improved precision due to the inclusion of polarization information in addition to temperature fluctuations.In particular we find that the total neutrino mass is constrained by Planck to be less than 0.23 eV at 95",1,0
"We study the impact of cosmic rays (CRs) on population iii star formation in minihalos, using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with CR physics implemented self-consistently. We find that CR pressure suppresses fragmentation and increases the Jeans mass by factors of 2-5 at redshifts z = 10-20. This effect is more pronounced for higher values of the CR diffusion coefficient Dcr. The suppression of fragmentation leads to an increase in the number density of massive stars formed per halo as well as their total luminosity. For our fiducial value of Dcr = 3 × 1026 cm2 s−1 we obtain a factor of 4-10 enhancement over the case without CR feedback. Our results are consistent with recent observations of high-z galaxies. In addition, we show that CR feedback can explain the observed correlation between galaxy stellar masses and black hole masses. Finally, we discuss possible observational signatures of this mechanism.",1,0
"Erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs) are widely used in the field of telecommunication and sensing applications due to their high gain, low noise figure, wide bandwidths and compatibility with silica fibers. However, EDFAs have some disadvantages such as high cost and limited lifetime because they require expensive rare-earth elements like erbium ions. In this study, we report on the preparation of new glass-ceramic materials based on sodium chloride and potassium chloride phosphates containing different concentrations of Er3+ ions by melt-quenching method. The structural characterization was performed using X-ray powder diffraction analysis (XRPD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Optical absorption spectra were recorded at room temperature between 300 nm and 1600 nm. Photoluminescence emission measurements were carried out under 980-nm excitation wavelength. It is found that the prepared samples show good transparency over a broad range of wavelengths up to 1600 nm.",1,0

"We have used the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to study the lensing effect on background quasars by foreground galaxies associated with Mg II absorption systems at 0.4 <z abs < 2.0 in order to determine their masses and sizes. We find that most of these galaxy halos are well described by singular isothermal spheres with velocity dispersions ranging between 100 - 300 km/sec. The mean mass density within one effective radius for our sample is ρ_e = 1.5 × 10^20 M_⊙/Mpc^3 which corresponds to an average halo circular velocity of 220 km/sec. This value agrees very well with previous studies based on gravitational lensing measurements as well as dynamical estimates using virial theorem arguments. Using this result we can estimate the total number of dark matter particles enclosed within one effective radius of each absorber system. For all but two cases, the estimated particle numbers agree reasonably well with those expected if the absorbing gas traces the underlying dark matter distribution.",1,0
"We report on the non-saturating magnetoresistance (NSMR) effect observed for thin films with an inhomogeneous distribution of charge carriers, which is caused by their trapping at defects or impurities. We show that this NSMR can be explained within the framework of the semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory if one takes into account the spatial dependence of the scattering time. The latter was calculated using Monte Carlo simulations based on the solution of the kinetic equation for electrons interacting with phonons and static disorder potential fluctuations. Our results are compared to experimental data obtained for InAs/GaSb superlattices grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Non-saturating magnetoresistivity has been recently discovered in various materials including semiconductors [1] , metals [2] , carbon nanotubes [3] . This phenomenon manifests itself as a linear increase of resistivity ρ(H) ∝ H when magnetic field H increases up to several Tesla. It is believed that it originates from the presence of spatially localized states near the Fermi level [4] . In this work we study the non-saturating magnetotransport properties of semiconductor heterostructures consisting of alternating layers of GaSb/InAs. These structures were grown by molecular beam epi-taxy [5] . They have a high density of structural imperfections such as dislocations [6] and stacking faults [7] . As a result, they exhibit strong electron localization [8] leading to pronounced quantum confinement effects [9] . Figure 1 shows typical temperature dependences of resistance R xx measured along the growth direction z for different values of applied magnetic fields. One can see that all curves demonstrate metallic behavior down to low temperatures T < 2 K. At higher temperatures there appears a weak insulating-like behavior due to thermally activated hopping between localized states [10] . For small magnetic fields [ Fig.1(a) ] the resistance decreases monotonically upon cooling indicating the dominance of elastic scattering processes [11] . However, for larger fields [Figs. 1(c),1(d)] the resistance exhibits non-monotonic behavior with a minimum around 10-20 K followed by",1,0
"We study vacuum energy in quantum field theory with boundary conditions that break conformal invariance, such as Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. We show how to renormalize this quantity using zeta function regularization techniques. In particular we find that for any number of dimensions there is an infinite set of counterterms which must be included when computing the vacuum energy density at zero temperature. This result has implications for Casimir effect calculations where one considers two parallel plates separated by some distance. The presence of these additional terms can lead to significant changes in the results obtained previously. Finally we consider the case of fermions coupled to scalar fields and compute the vacuum expectation value of the stress-energy tensor. For certain values of the coupling constant it turns out that the vacuum state becomes unstable due to spontaneous symmetry breaking. Vacuum energy plays an important role in many areas of physics including cosmology [1] , black hole thermodynamics [2] , and condensed matter systems [3] . It also appears in various contexts within string theory [4] . In recent years much progress has been made towards understanding the nature of vacuum fluctuations in quantum field theories (QFTs) [5] - [8] . However most work done so far has focused primarily on QFTs defined on flat space-time manifolds without boundaries [9] - [11] . Recently however there have been several attempts to understand vacuum fluctuations in QFTs defined on curved backgrounds [12] - [14] . Another interesting problem involves studying vacuum fluctuations in QFT's defined on spaces with boundaries [15] - [17] . Such problems are relevant for example in the context of Casimir effects [18] - [20] .",1,0
"The origin of the magnetoelectric effect (ME) is investigated by first-principles calculations for bulk and surface structures of BiFeO_3, which has been recently discovered to be ferroelectric with antiferromagnetic ordering at room temperature.The calculated results show that the ME coupling constant is strongly dependent on the oxygen octahedral tilt angle θ_oct; it increases rapidly as θ_oct decreases below 11^∘∼ 13^∘. This result suggests that the large ME response observed experimentally can be attributed mainly to the rotation of oxygen octahedra around the c-axis. In addition, we find that the contribution from the Fe magnetic moment plays an important role in enhancing the ME effect when θ_oct becomes small enough. Finally, we discuss possible origins of the discrepancy between our theoretical prediction and experimental observation. We also present some suggestions for further experiments.",1,0
"We study the thermal instability and fragmentation of an initially uniform, isothermal cloud embedded in a hot plasma flow with constant velocity shear using two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. The initial temperature difference between the cloud and its surroundings leads to the development of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities at the cloud boundary which grow into mushroom-like structures that are unstable against Kelvin-Helmholtz modes as well. We find that these two types of instabilities can lead to the formation of filaments and clumps within the cloud on different timescales depending on the strength of the magnetic field. In addition we show that heat conduction has only minor effects on the cloud's morphology but significantly influences the cloud's internal structure by smoothing out density fluctuations. Finally, we discuss how our results may be used to explain observations of cometary globules and other dense molecular clouds.

"We report on the measurement of electric fields produced by surface contaminants using neutral atoms as probes. The technique is based on measuring the Stark shift in atomic resonance lines due to an applied electric field, and has been used previously for studying electric fields near surfaces such as those found at liquid helium temperatures or in high vacuum environments.We have extended this method to measure electric fields over a wide range of temperatures (4 K - 300 K) and pressures (10-6 Torr - atmospheric pressure). In addition we demonstrate that it can be used to study electric fields generated by charged particles trapped close to surfaces. This work opens up new possibilities for probing electric fields in many different systems including biological samples where conventional techniques are limited. Measurement of electric fields produced by charged particle traps using neutral atoms: A novel probe of local electrostatic potentials. Measuring electric fields produced by surface contaminant... Neutral atoms provide a unique tool for investigating electric fields because they respond directly to the vector potential associated with electromagnetic fields. Here we use this property to measure electric fields produced by surface contamination. Our approach relies on observing the Stark splitting of atomic energy levels when exposed to external electric fields. Previous experiments have demonstrated this effect in low temperature and ultra-high vacuum conditions1-5 but here we show how these measurements may also be performed under more typical laboratory conditions.",1,0
"We present results for the chemical composition and temperature structure of two different models of dense molecular clouds, which are based on detailed microphysical calculations including gas-grain interactions. The first model is an isolated spherical core that collapses under its own gravity; it has been evolved up to densities of 10^8 cm^-3. In this case we find that grain-surface reactions play only a minor role because they occur mainly at low temperatures where the density is too small to allow efficient freeze-out onto grains. However, these processes can be important if the collapse proceeds faster than predicted by standard theory (e.g., due to magnetic fields). We also study the evolution of a protostellar envelope surrounding a newly formed star. Here we find that the formation of complex organic molecules such as methanol or formaldehyde requires high densities and relatively warm temperatures. This suggests that these species may not be abundant enough to explain their observed abundances in dark clouds unless additional sources of heating exist.",1,0
"We present the first results on transition region (TR) lines obtained by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS), aboard the Solar-B satellite, in active regions and quiet Sun areas. The EIS data are compared to those taken simultaneously by the EUV Imaging Telescope (EIT). We find that TR line intensities show significant enhancements over their photospheric values at temperatures between 10 5 K and 2 Â 10 6 K. In addition, we observe strong spatial variations in the intensity ratios among different TR lines. These observations suggest that there is an abundance variation across the solar surface for some elements such as Fe xii, Fe xiii, Si vii, and Mg ix.

"We present an analysis of early X-ray afterglow data for eight gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in which we find evidence that they are associated with relativistic jets viewed off-axis, and show how this can be used to probe jet structure. We use our model to predict the late-time behaviour of these GRB afterglows and compare it with observations made by Swift/XRT. The results suggest that the majority of GRB jets have a structured energy distribution, with most of the kinetic energy contained within a narrow cone along the jet axis. This is consistent with theoretical expectations based on models where GRBs result from the collapse of massive stars into black holes or neutron stars.IntroductionGamma-ray bursts (GRBs; see Piran 2004 , Gehrels et al. 2009 ) are brief flashes of high-energy radiation lasting typically 10 s but ranging up to several hundred seconds. They were first detected over 50 years ago (Klebesadel et al. 1973; Strong et al. 1974) , but despite extensive observational efforts there remain many open questions about them. In particular, what powers the emission? What causes the observed diversity between different bursts? The standard fireball model (see e.g., ReesMeszaros 1992; Sari 1997; Piran 1999; Wijers 2001; KumarZhang 2015) provides one explanation for the prompt phase of GRB emission. It involves the dissipation of kinetic energy stored in a relativistically expanding shell of plasma produced during some catastrophic event such as the merger of two compact objects or the collapse of a massive star. However, this model cannot explain all aspects of GRB phenomenology. For example, it does not account for the wide range of durations seen across the population of GRBs (e.g., Nakar 2007), nor do current models provide any satisfactory explanation for why only a small fraction of collapsing stars produce observable GRBs (e. g., BrommLoeb 2006) . Furthermore, the lack of detection of optical counterparts to short-duration GRBs has led to suggestions that at least some",1,0
"We prove that the Kirillov-Reshitikhin conjecture holds for any semisimple Lie algebra over an arbitrary field, and in particular we show that the number of irreducible representations of the quantum group is equal to the dimension of its Cartan subalgebra.We also give some applications of this result to the representation theory of finite groups. The Kirillov-Reshetkhin Conjecture states that if 𝔤 is a simple complex Lie algebra with root system R = Φ(𝔤) then there exists a bijection between the set of isomorphism classes of irreducible representations of the quantized enveloping algebra U_q(𝔤^0) (where q is not a root of unity), and the set of dominant weights λ∈ P^+(R) such that |λ| ≤ q - 1.The proof uses results on the classification of indecomposable tilting modules due to Donkin, Erdmann, Mathieu and Schmidt; these are combined with techniques developed by Lusztig and Kashiwara to obtain our main theorem.",1,0
"The cut-off covering spectrum is the set of all functions in L^2(ℝ) whose Fourier transforms are supported on [-1,1] and have absolute value at most 1 everywhere.It was introduced by David Hilbert as an example of a non-trivial closed subspace of L^2 that does not contain any nonconstant entire analytic function.In this talk we will discuss some recent results about the structure of the cut-off covering spectrum. The first part of our discussion concerns the problem of determining whether or not a given bounded linear operator on L^2 has finite rank.We show how to use the theory of Toeplitz operators with matrix symbols developed by Sarason and others to give a complete solution to this problem for certain classes of operators including those arising from multiplication by polynomials.For other classes of operators such as those coming from multiplication by trigonometric polynomials it turns out that there exist examples which do not fall into one of these categories but still have finite rank.The second part of our discussion concerns a theorem due to Joram Lindenstrauss concerning the existence of extremal points in the unit ball of the space of continuous functions on the circle with absolutely convergent Fourier series.This theorem can be viewed as a generalization of the classical result of Carleson stating that every point in the unit ball of H^1_0(T) (the Hardy space of order 1)is an extreme point of the unit ball of H^1_o(T) where T = [0,2π].By using techniques similar to those used in the proof of the original theorem of Carleson we prove a version of Lindenstrauss' theorem for the space of continuous functions...",1,0
"We study the gravitational self-force acting on a wave packet in curved spacetime, and show that it causes its distortion.We consider two types of wavepackets: one is constructed by superposing plane waves with different frequencies; another is made up of spherical waves emitted at various angles around an isolated source point. In both cases we find that the force acts as if there were additional sources located behind the packet's center-of-mass worldline. The effect can be understood intuitively using the concept of 'gravitational memory'. Our results are relevant for understanding how gravitational waves propagate through space-time. They also provide new insights into the problem of gravitational radiation reaction. Introduction - A fundamental question about gravitational waves (GWs) concerns how they evolve over time when propagating through curved space-time [1] . This issue has been studied extensively within the framework of linearized gravity theory [2] , where GWs are treated as small perturbations of flat Minkowski background geometry [3] . In this work we focus on the effects due to gravitational self-coupling [4] . These arise because each part of a GW carries energy density which exerts pressure back onto itself via Newtonian gravity [5] . As such, the total force acting upon any given portion of a GW depends not only on the local curvature but also on the entire history of the wave [6] . It turns out that these forces cause significant distortions of the wave packets [7, 8] . For example, the shape of a plane-wave packet changes during propagation so that its peak moves away from the direction of motion [9] . Similar behavior was found for spherical wave packets [10] .",1,0
"We have recently shown that the one-range addition theorems derived in our previous work are valid not only for the Coulomb interaction potential but also its derivatives, such as the nuclear attraction potential or the exchange potential.In this comment we show how these results can be used to derive new addition theorems for the nuclear attraction potential and the exchange potential. These new addition theorems are useful when calculating matrix elements between atomic orbitals with different angular momenta. We illustrate their application using examples involving hydrogenic wave functions. Finally, we discuss some possible extensions of these results.

They provide simple expressions for evaluating matrix elements of various potentials between two arbitrary wavefunctions. For example, they allow us to calculate matrix elements of the Coulomb interaction potential between any pair of atomic orbital basis sets without having to perform complicated numerical integrations [6]. Recently, we showed that the same approach could be applied to other types of potentials [7-9].",1,0
"We consider the problem of finding an approximate solution to the following boundary value problem:-Δu = finΩ,u = 0on∂Ω.Here Ω is a bounded domain in R^n with smooth boundary ∂Ω.We assume that f belongs to L^2(Ω) and satisfies some additional conditions which are specified below. The main goal of this work is to develop efficient numerical methods for solving (1). In particular we will focus on spectral methods based on the use of spherical harmonics expansions. These methods have been successfully applied to various types of partial differential equations arising in mathematical physics. However their application to the problem under consideration has not yet been studied systematically. Here we present several new results concerning the convergence analysis of these methods as well as their implementation details. Our approach allows us to obtain optimal order error estimates without any regularity assumptions about the exact solution or its derivatives.",1,0
"We study the scattering properties of surface plasmons (SPs) by a single subwavelength groove in an optically thick metal film, which is excited by a normally incident plane wave with circular polarization. The SP field distribution and its decay length are calculated using the Green's function method for different values of the groove depth hg and width wg. It is found that when the groove depth increases to a certain value, the SP field decays exponentially along both directions away from the groove center instead of being confined within the groove region as before. This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that the SP mode becomes leaky once it scatters into radiation modes through the groove aperture. We also find that there exists another critical groove depth beyond which no SP field can exist inside or outside the groove due to total internal reflection between the groove walls. These results provide useful information on how to design efficient plasmonic devices based on grooves.",1,0
"The National Science Foundation (NSF) has recently formed an 'Exoplanet Task Force' with the goal of identifying key science goals for future space missions in exoplanet research, including radio astrometry.In this white paper we present our vision on how such a mission could be designed to meet these goals. We argue that a dedicated radio telescope is needed to detect and characterize extrasolar planets using their radio emission. The proposed instrument would have unprecedented sensitivity at decimeter wavelengths, allowing it to detect planetary mass companions around nearby stars as well as directly measure the masses of known giant planet systems. This will enable us to answer fundamental questions about the formation and evolution of planetary systems. Keywords: Radio astronomy, Extrasolar planet detection, Planetary system characterization, Space mission concept development. 1 IntroductionThe discovery of more than 1000 extra-solar planets over the past decade has revolutionized our understanding of planetary systems beyond our own solar system. However, many important questions remain unanswered regarding the origin and evolution of these systems. For example, what are the physical characteristics of most of these newly discovered planets? How do they form? What happens when two or more planets interact gravitationally? Are there other Earth-like worlds orbiting Sun-like stars within reachable distances?Answering these questions requires detailed observations of individual planets, which can only be achieved by direct imaging techniques. Unfortunately, current ground-based observatories cannot achieve high enough angular resolution to resolve the majority of close-in planets due to atmospheric turbulence effects.To overcome this limitation, NASA's Kepler satellite was launched in 2009 to search for transiting planets around bright stars. Although Kepler has been extremely successful, its primary focus is on detecting large planets in short orbits. It does not provide any information on the orbital inclination angle of detected planets, nor does it allow for precise measurements of planet radii and masses. Furthermore, because of its relatively small field-of-view, Kepler misses out on discoveries made outside of its target fields.",1,0
"The book is divided into three parts, each part containing several chapters. The first part deals with cosmological models and their predictions for large-scale structures observed today. In this section we will discuss how galaxies form and evolve within these models. We will also introduce some basic concepts such as dark matter halos, galaxy biasing etc., which are important to understand the formation of large scale structure. The second part discusses observational techniques used to study the distribution of galaxies on different scales. Here we will describe various surveys that have been carried out over past few decades using ground-based telescopes or space based missions like Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Finally, third part describes statistical methods commonly used to analyze data obtained by observing the universe. This includes topics ranging from correlation functions to power spectrum analysis. The main goal of this course is to provide an introduction to modern astrophysics. It covers many aspects of theoretical physics and observational astronomy including general relativity, quantum mechanics, nuclear physics, particle physics, stellar evolution, black holes, supernovae, quasars, gamma-ray bursts, pulsar, gravitational waves, cosmic microwave background radiation, big bang nucleosynthesis, inflationary cosmology, dark energy, dark matter, baryonic acoustic oscillations, primordial fluctuations, galaxy clusters, supermassive black holes, active galactic nuclei, starburst galaxies, infrared galaxies, radio galaxies, interacting galaxies, merging galaxies, elliptical galaxies, lenticular galaxies, spiral galaxies, irregular galaxies, dwarf galaxies, blue compact dwarfs, Lyman-break galaxies, high-z quasars, distant red galaxies, high-redshift galaxies, intergalactic medium, interstellar medium, Milky Way Galaxy, Local Group of Galaxies, Virgo Cluster of Galaxies, Coma Cluster of Galaxies, Perseus Cluster of Galaxies, Abell Clusters of Galaxies, Large Scale Structure of the Universe, Cosmic Web, Supercluster-void network, Dark Matter Halos, Biased Growth of Structures, Observational Techniques, Statistical Methods, Cosmological Parameters, Future Directions...",1,0
"In this article, we study families of holomorphic vector bundles on complex algebraic varieties. We prove that the set of isomorphism classes of such families is naturally an affine scheme over the base variety and give explicit equations for it in terms of Chern classes.In particular, if the base variety has dimension one then these schemes are reduced to points corresponding to the rank and degree of each bundle in the family.We also show how our results can be used to construct moduli spaces of stable vector bundles with fixed determinant. The main result of this article was announced by J. P. Serre at the conference 'Algebraic geometry and number theory' held in Paris in June 2005 (see [Ser] ). Families of holomorphic vector bundles have been studied extensively since the work of Grothendieck [Gro1] . They play important roles both in algebraic geometry and mathematical physics; see e.g., [Bri1,Bri2,Bri3,...",1,0
"We show that the exchange-only optimized potentials (OEPs) are not equivalent to the Kohn-Sham (KS) method in general, even if one uses an exact density functional for the exchangecorrelation energy. We demonstrate this by solving analytically the OEPs for two simple model systems using Gaussian-type orbitals as basis functions. The results obtained within both approaches differ significantly. In particular, we find that the KS approach yields incorrect values for the total energies of these systems. This is due to the fact that the KS equations do not have solutions corresponding to all possible densities which can be generated by the given basis sets. On the other hand, the OEP formalism always provides unique solutions for any given density matrix. Our analysis shows also how to resolve the apparent paradox arising when trying to apply the OEP formalism to the case where only a limited number of basis functions is used.",1,0
"We report the detection of beryllium (Be) lines in two ultra-low metallicity halo stars, CS 22892-052 and HE 0107-5240.These are the first detections of Be in metal-poor halo stars with [Fe/H] < -2.5 dex. We find that these stars have high surface gravities for their temperatures, indicating they may be blue stragglers or other evolved objects. In addition to the Be features at 4131 Å and 4130 Å we also see evidence for an unidentified feature near 3970 Å which is likely due to C+N+O. This work was supported by NASA grant NAG5-9998. Keywords: Beryllium; Blue straggler; Metal poor star; Ultracool dwarf. 1. Introduction. The discovery of extremely low-mass stars has opened up new avenues into understanding how planets form around very cool dwarfs. However, there remains much uncertainty about the formation process itself as well as the chemical composition of such systems. One important aspect of this problem involves determining whether or not terrestrial planet formation can occur within the habitable zone of ultracool dwarfs. To address this question it will be necessary to determine if the atmospheres of these stars contain significant amounts of heavy elements like carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, sodium, potassium, magnesium, aluminum, silicon, calcium, titanium, iron, nickel, cobalt, copper, zinc, arsenic, selenium, silver, gold, mercury, lead, uranium, thorium, and plutonium. It should be noted that while some of these metals are produced during stellar nucleosynthesis others are synthesized only through cosmic ray spallation reactions occurring outside of stars.",1,0
"We present an efficient algorithm for computing the number of points on curves over finite fields with odd characteristic, which is based on the use of quadratic reciprocity laws and the Hasse-Weil bound in the form of Weierstrass functions. The main idea behind our approach consists in reducing the problem to that of finding the number of solutions of certain systems of linear equations modulo primes of small norm. This allows us to obtain a very fast running time by using standard techniques such as modular reduction or lattice basis reduction algorithms. In particular we show how this method can be used to compute efficiently the number of rational points on hyperelliptic curves defined over prime fields. Finally, we give some numerical examples illustrating the efficiency of our algorithm compared to other known methods.

"In this article, we present an approach for studying special Finsler manifolds by using global methods and techniques in Riemannian geometry. We introduce some new concepts such as geodesic convexity, strongly convexity, and strictly convexity on special Finsler manifolds. Then, we prove that every special Finsler manifold is locally geodesically convex at any point. Finally, we show that if a special Finsler manifold admits a strictly convex function then it has constant flag curvature. Keywords: Geodesic convexity, Finsler metric, Flag curvature. Mathematics Subject Classification (2010): 53C20, 53C25, 53A10. In this article, we study special Finsler manifolds with global methods and techniques in the theory of Riemannian geometry. First, we define geodesic convexity and strongly convexity on special Finslser manifolds. Then, under certain conditions, we prove that every Finsler manifold is locallygeodesically convex at each point. Next, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for a special Finsler manifold to have constant flag curvature.",1,0
"We present high resolution X-ray imaging and spectroscopy of the central region of the galaxy cluster Abell S1063 (IC342). The data were obtained with Chandra ACIS-S3 in August 2002, for an exposure time of 50 ks. We detect two bright point sources at the center of the cluster which are associated to AGNs. Their luminosities range between 1043 erg/sec and 1044 erg/sec in the 0.5-10 keV energy band. In addition we find evidence that there is diffuse emission around these sources. This emission has a temperature of about 3 keV and its spectrum can be fitted by a thermal plasma model with solar abundance ratios. From our analysis it appears that this gas may have been heated up recently due to shocks produced during mergers or interactions among subclusters. Finally, we also detected extended soft emission surrounding both AGN candidates. Its origin could be either thermal bremsstrahlung radiation from hot gas or inverse Compton scattering off relativistic electrons.",1,0
"We introduce the notion of Landau (Γ, χ)-automorphic functions of magnitude ν for any integer ν≥ 0 and show that they are holomorphic sections of certain line bundles over the complex flag manifold ℂ^N / Λ^(ν)_ℕ = SL_N(ℂ)/Sp_2N - N_0(ℂ).We also prove an analogue of the Riemann-Roch theorem in this setting which allows us to compute the dimension of these spaces explicitly as a function of ν. Finally we give some examples of explicit bases for these spaces. This is joint work with Jens Franke. The results presented here were obtained while I was at the University of Hamburg under the supervision of Prof. Dr.-Ing. Henning Samtleben. In this article we study automorphic forms on the complex flag manifold SL_N(ℤ)/Sp^2N-N_0(ℤ) where N denotes the number of rows of the matrix representation of the group element. These automorphic forms can be viewed as holomorphic sections of certain vector bundles over the flag manifold whose fibers are given by homogeneous polynomials of degree ν in n variables. For each such polynomial there exists a unique irreducible representation of the Lie algebra 𝔰𝔩_n into the space of endomorphisms of the corresponding fiber. Using this correspondence between representations and vector bundles one obtains a decomposition of the flag bundle into line bundles. Our main result shows how to construct holomorphic sections of these line bundles using theta series associated to the underlying lattice Λ_(ν).",1,0
"We consider the problem of energy-efficient modulation for downlink transmissions over code-division multiple-access (CDMA) networks, where each user has an individual delay constraint and is equipped with a rechargeable battery that can be charged by harvesting ambient radio-frequency signals. We formulate this problem as a noncooperative game between users competing for limited power resources under their own constraints on transmission rates and delays. In particular, we show how to compute Nash equilibria of such games using convex optimization techniques. Our numerical results demonstrate significant gains in terms of both network throughput and energy efficiency compared to conventional schemes based on fixed-rate transmissions. The proposed approach also allows us to quantify tradeoffs among different performance metrics, including average packet delay, outage probability, and energy consumption per bit.

"The variation in the values of physical constants is one of the most important problems for modern physics, cosmology and astrophysics. The main goal of this work was to study the possible time variations of some fundamental constants (fine structure constant α, gravitational constant G, proton-to-electron mass ratio μ) using different theoretical approaches as well as observational data on distant objects.In our previous works we have shown that the observed redshifts of quasars can be explained by varying fine-structure constant with cosmic time. We also found that the evolution of the universe may lead to the change of other fundamental constants such as gravitational constant or proton-to-electron mass ratio. Here we present new results obtained within the framework of these models. First, we show how the model based on varying fine-structure constant explains the recent measurements of quasar absorption lines at high redshift performed by Webb et al. (1999) . Second, we discuss the possibility of explaining the Hubble parameter H0 = 72 ± 8 km s-1 Mpc-1 measured recently by Freedman et al. (2001) using the same approach. Finally, we consider another class of models where all three fundamental constants vary simultaneously.",1,0
"We propose an experiment to entangle two independent photons in the time domain, using only linear optical elements and single-photon detectors.The scheme is based on measuring the arrival times of the photons at different locations with respect to each other. We show that this measurement can be used to generate entanglement between the photons without any post-selection or feed-forward operations. This method may find applications for quantum communication networks where it would allow one to distribute entangled states over large distances. Entanglement plays a central role in many areas of physics ranging from condensed matter systems [1] , atomic gases [2] , and trapped ions [3] to quantum information processing [4] . In particular, entanglement has been shown to be essential for quantum teleportation [5] , superdense coding [6] , quantum key distribution [7] , and quantum computing [8] . In recent years there have been several proposals to create entanglement between distant particles [9] - [11] . However, most schemes require either nonlinear interactions [12] , which are difficult to implement experimentally [13] , or postselection [14] , which introduces additional noise into the system [15] . Recently, we proposed a new scheme [16] to produce entanglement between remote particles using only linear optics [17] and single photon detection [18] . Our approach relies on performing measurements on the arrival times of the particles at different locations [19] . Here we present detailed calculations showing how our proposal works as well as its experimental feasibility [20] .Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of our setup. Two identical sources emit pairs of photons (red) towards Alice's station A and Bob's station B respectively [21] . Each source consists of a pulsed laser [22] generating pairs of photons via spontaneous parametric down-conversion [23] . These photons travel through separate paths until they reach stations A and B [24] . At these stations, Alice and Bob perform measurements on their respective photons [25] . They measure the arrival times tA and tB [26] of...",1,0
"We present an algorithm for finding galaxy clusters using only photometric redshifts and no spectroscopic information, based on identifying overdensities of galaxies with similar colours. We apply this method to the Millennium simulation (Springel et al., 2005) and compare our results against those obtained by applying the same technique to mock catalogues constructed from semi-analytic models of galaxy formation within dark matter haloes. The comparison shows that we are able to recover most of the true cluster population at z < 1.5, but find significant contamination due to projection effects beyond this redshift. This is mainly caused by the fact that the colour-magnitude relation becomes less tight as one moves towards higher redshifts. Our analysis also reveals that there exists a large number of spurious detections which can be removed by imposing additional constraints such as requiring all candidate members to have magnitudes brighter than some threshold value or by restricting ourselves to systems whose total luminosity exceeds a certain limit.",1,0
"We present an effective method to conserve the total energy and linear momentum in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations by introducing two types of potentials: one is used during the MD run, while another is only used when calculating the forces on particles at each time step. The latter type of potentials are switched off after being calculated so that they do not affect the subsequent MD trajectories. We show how this scheme can be implemented into existing MD codes with minimal modifications. In addition, we demonstrate its effectiveness through several examples including liquid argon, water clusters, and carbon nanotubes. Our results indicate that our new scheme conserves both energy and momentum very well even though it does not require any additional computational cost compared to conventional schemes.

"In this work, we propose an encounter based worm interaction model to evaluate the performance of different node characteristics in terms of their ability to detect and prevent worms spreading over mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). We consider two types of nodes with distinct capabilities for detecting and preventing worms: normal nodes that are vulnerable to infection by worms but can detect them using signature detection techniques; and immune nodes which have no vulnerability to worm infections but can prevent worm propagation through quarantine mechanisms. The proposed model is used to study how these two types of nodes interact when they meet each other during network operation. In particular, our results show that: 1) Immune nodes play a significant role in reducing the number of infected nodes as well as the total number of encounters between susceptible and infectious nodes; 2) Immune nodes should be deployed at strategic locations within MANETs; 3) Immune nodes should not only focus on quarantining infectious nodes but also on isolating suspicious nodes; 4) Immune nodes should use both signature detection and quarantine mechanisms simultaneously to achieve better performance against worm propagation; 5) Immune nodes should adopt dynamic quarantine strategies instead of static ones since static quarantine may lead to unnecessary isolation of legitimate nodes.",1,0
"We study the ground state properties and excitations in the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice with nearest-neighbor interactions only, using exact diagonalization (ED) for small clusters up to 12 sites as well as density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations for larger systems. We find that the ground-state energy per site is lower than the classical value by about 0.25J, where J denotes the exchange coupling constant between neighboring spins. The magnetic susceptibility shows Curie-Weiss behavior at high temperatures but decreases rapidly below T = 2J/3. This indicates strong quantum fluctuations which are also reflected in the low-temperature dependence of the specific heat. In addition we observe an unusual peak structure in the spin-spin correlation function S(q). For q along the principal axes of the Brillouin zone this peak has its maximum at q = π while it shifts towards smaller values when approaching the diagonals.",1,0
"We study the nonlinear evolution of baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) in an expanding universe using numerical simulations with N-body particles and hydrodynamic gas dynamics. We find that BAOs are suppressed by nonlinear gravitational clustering, but they can be recovered by applying a Wiener filter to the density field at each redshift. The reconstructed power spectrum agrees well with linear theory predictions on large scales where the effect is negligible. On small scales, however, we observe significant deviations between the two spectra due to nonlinear effects such as shell crossing and virialization. These results suggest that it may be possible to use BAOs as standard rulers for cosmological distance measurements even when the underlying matter distribution becomes highly nonlinear. In this work, we present our main findings below.1 IntroductionBaryons play important roles in galaxy formation through their interactions with dark matter. For example, observations show that galaxies form around peaks of the primordial density fluctuations which grow into massive halos via gravitational instability. Therefore, understanding how baryons evolve in time and space is crucial for studying galaxy formation processes.In recent years, there has been growing interest in measuring the large-scale structure of the Universe using baryonic tracers like neutral hydrogen or stars. One promising method involves tracing the spatial distribution of these objects back in time using spectroscopic surveys. This technique allows us to measure the statistical properties of the cosmic web, including its geometry and topology, over a wide range of redshifts.The most prominent feature observed in the measured correlation functions of various types of baryonic tracers is known as 'baryonic acoustic oscillation' (BAO). It refers to periodic wiggles seen in the power spectrum of the tracer population caused by sound waves propagating through the early universe before decoupling [see e.g., 1] . Since the amplitude of the BAO signal depends only weakly on the physical state of the medium, it provides a robust way to probe the expansion history of the universe independent of other cosmological parameters [2] . Recently, several groups have reported detections of the BAO signature in the correlation function of Lyman",1,0
"The main goal of this research is the study and analysis of how different users can contribute in an open source software project, by sharing their knowledge through comments on issues or pull requests (PRs). The authors propose a new method for analyzing user participation based on the number of views that each comment receives during its life cycle. This work also presents a novel technique for identifying relevant comments using text mining techniques applied over the textual content of PRs. Finally, it proposes a ranking algorithm which takes into account both the relevance score assigned to each comment and the number of times they have been viewed. In order to evaluate these proposals, we conducted experiments with data collected from GitHub repositories related to two well-known open-source projects. We found out that our proposed methods are able to identify relevant comments more accurately than other state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, we observed that the proposed ranking algorithm improves the results obtained when only considering the relevance scores.",1,0
"We report on our search for planets transiting the debris disk host star AU Mic (M3V). We observed two transit events with Spitzer Space Telescope's IRAC camera at 3.6 and 4.5 microns in 2009-2010 using the same technique as described by Charbonneau et al. (2005) . The first event was detected only in one bandpass while the second event showed no evidence of a transit signal above the noise level. Using these data we place upper limits on the radius R p /R s < 0.11 and mass m sin i < 1.1 MJup for any planet orbiting AU Mic within an orbital period P = 2 days. These results are consistent with previous studies that have found few or none giant planets around low-mass stars like AU Mic.Keywords: Planetary systems - Formation, evolution, structure; Exoplanet detection techniques - Transit photometry",1,0
"We present an algorithm for mapping the cosmological confidence ball surface, which is defined as the set of all points in parameter space that are consistent with current observations at some specified level of statistical significance.The algorithm uses Monte Carlo Markov Chains to generate samples from the posterior probability distribution function (PDF) and then calculates the likelihoods of these samples using a modified version of CosmoMC.We apply this method to two different data sets - WMAP7+BAO+H0 and Planck+WP+highL+BAO+H0+JLA - and find that our results agree well with those obtained by other authors who have used similar techniques.In addition we show how one can use this technique to calculate the volume enclosed within the cosmological confidence ball.

"We study string theory in anti-de Sitter space-time (AdS) with two dimensions, which is dual to noncritical M-theory at high energies. We show that this duality can be understood as an equivalence between certain two-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs). The CFT corresponding to strings on AdS_2 has central charge c = 3l/2G, where l is the radius of curvature of AdS_2 and G is Newton's constant. This CFT contains a free boson X_0 and a fermion ψ; we find that the partition function Z(β) for these fields satisfies the following functional equation:Z(β) = Z(1/β) exp[-β^2/2ln(1-e^-2π i/3)]. Here 1/β plays the role of the coupling constant λ in the worldsheet action. In particular, when 1/β→ 0, the partition function becomes Z(0) = 1, while it vanishes exponentially fast if 1/β→∞.",1,0
"The theta + (θ+) effect has been observed by many authors, but it was never explained satisfactorily.In this work we propose an explanation for its origin based on the fact that θ+ appears only when there are two or more particles with opposite spin states present at the same time. We show how to calculate the probability amplitude of finding such pairs using Feynman diagrams. The results obtained agree well with those reported experimentally. This article is available from:  The theta + (θ+ ) effect [1] , which consists of a small increase in the intensity of the scattered beam as compared to the unscattered one, has been observed by several authors [2] - [4] . However, no satisfactory explanation has yet been given for its origin [5] . In this work we propose an interpretation for the appearance of θ+ based on the fact that it occurs only if there are simultaneously two or more particles with different spins [6] . To demonstrate our hypothesis, we use Feynman's diagrammatic method [7] to calculate the probability amplitudes corresponding to these processes [8] .",1,0
"The authors present an overview of the role that knots play in proteins, with particular emphasis on their function and evolution.They discuss how protein knots are formed by covalent bonds between amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) as well as non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding.The authors also describe how different types of knots can be classified based upon their topology.Finally they explain why it is important to study knots in proteins since these structures may have evolved for specific functions or because they provide stability against proteolysis (breakdown into smaller peptides).This article was originally published on BioMed Central. It has been re-posted here under Creative Commons License 3.0. Protein knots are intriguing structural motifs found within many naturally occurring polypeptides. These knotted conformations result from noncovalent interactions among residues along the backbone chain combined with covalent cross-linkages at certain positions.

We then highlight recent advances made toward characterizing the functional roles played by protein knots.",1,0
"The WiFeS instrument is an integral field spectrograph for the Australian National University 2.3m telescope at Siding Spring Observatory, Australia.It has been in operation since 2005 and was designed to provide high quality optical spectroscopy over a wide range of wavelengths with minimal overheads.The WiFeS instrument consists of two cameras that are mounted on a common baseplate which sits inside a vacuum chamber attached to the Cassegrain focus of the ANU 2.3m telescope.Each camera contains a lenslet array that produces a set of images across its focal plane.These images can be combined into a single data cube using software developed by Dopita et al.

"We present numerical simulations to study the formation, evolution, and collapse of quiescent cloud cores induced by dynamic compressions in turbulent molecular clouds. We find that these cloud cores are formed through shock compression at intersections between shocks driven into the clouds by supersonic turbulence. The cloud core masses range from 0.1 M⊙ to 1 M⊙ with typical sizes of about 1000 AU. These cloud cores have low internal velocities (< 2 km s-1) but can be accelerated up to 10 km s-1 during their lifetimes due to gravitational interactions with other dense clumps within the same clouds. Most of them evolve quasi-statically for several free-fall times before collapsing dynamically on time scales ranging from one to ten free-fall times. Our results suggest that such cloud cores may represent an important source of prestellar objects in star-forming regions. Keywords: Turbulence, Star Formation",1,0

"We report on optical and near-infrared observations made with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in response to an alert issued by Swift/BAT for GRB050906, which was detected at 07:47:06 UT on September 6, 2005. The prompt emission lasted about 1 s and had a peak flux density of1 Crab. We find that this burst is similar to other short-duration gamma-ray bursts observed previously; it has no detectable afterglow down to limits of R > 26 mag at t = 0.5 hr and JHK > 23 mag at t = 2 days. However, we do detect a bright source coincident with the position of the X-ray afterglow reported by Swift/XRT.

These properties are consistent with those expected if the source were a massive star forming region within our Galaxy.",1,0
"We report the growth of millimeter-thick vertically aligned single-walled carbon-nanotube forests on SiO 2 /Si substrates by chemical vapor deposition using Fe nanoparticles as catalysts at temperatures between 700 °C and 850 °C in Ar/H 2 . The diameter distribution is centered around 1 nm, with an average tube length of about 10 μm. We find that the density of the grown forests increases linearly with time up to a maximum value of 3 × 10 11 cm -2 , which corresponds to a volume filling factor of 0.7 for the tubes. This high density can be explained by considering the balance between the nucleation rate and the growth rate of individual tubes. In addition, we show that the vertical alignment of the tubes is maintained over large areas (1 cm2 ) without any noticeable defects or cracks. These results suggest that these thick forests are promising candidates for applications such as field emitters and transparent electrodes.Carbon nanotubes have attracted considerable attention because they exhibit unique physical properties [1]. However, it has been difficult to grow high-quality carbon nanotubes due to their extremely small diameters [2]. Recently, several groups reported the growth of vertically aligned carbon nanotube arrays [3]–[6]. Although these studies demonstrated the potential use of carbon nanotubes in various fields [7, 8], most of them were limited to thin films less than 100 nm thick [9]. To fully exploit the advantages offered by carbon nanotubes, it is necessary to develop techniques capable of producing thicker films [10].",1,0
"The quantum electrodynamic (QED) effects on the dynamics and decoherence of semiconductor-based qubit systems are investigated in this work. The QED effect is described by an effective interaction between the qubit system and its environment, which consists of vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field as well as thermal photons at finite temperature. We show that the QED effect can be treated perturbatively for typical experimental parameters. In particular, we find that the spontaneous emission rate of excitons into free space modes increases with increasing number N of electrons involved in the qubit state. This leads to faster relaxation times T 1 , but also to stronger pure dephasing rates T 2 . For realistic values of N = 10 − 100, however, these effects remain small compared to other sources of relaxation such as phonon scattering or electron-electron interactions.IntroductionQuantum information processing has attracted considerable attention over recent years due to its potential applications in various fields ranging from communication technology [1] to metrology [2] . Semiconductor-based solid-state devices have been proposed as promising candidates for realizing scalable quantum computers [3] . Among them, excitonic states in semiconductors [4] represent one of the most important classes of physical objects suitable for storing and manipulating quantum information [5] . However, it turns out that exciton-exciton interactions [6] lead to rapid decay processes [7, 8] , so that only few excitations may be stored coherently within each individual device [9] . To overcome this problem, several proposals have been made recently [10] - [13] based on hybrid structures consisting of different materials [14] - [16] .In this Letter, we investigate how the quantum electrodynamic (or radiative) coupling [17] affects the dynamics of semiconductor-based qubit sys-tems. As shown schematically in Fig. 1(a) , our model includes two types of environments surrounding the qubit system: First, there exist vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic fields inside the cavity [18] , leading to spontaneous emission of excitons into free-space modes [19, 20] . Second, there exists a bath of thermal photons [21]",1,0
"We study the computational complexity of games with imperfect information, where players have no knowledge about each other's moves and actions are not necessarily alternating between them. We show that such games can be solved in polynomial time if they satisfy certain conditions on their structure (e.g., being bipartite). In particular, we prove this for all perfect-information games played by two or more players who do not know which player has made what move at any given point during play. Our results also apply to multiplayer versions of some well-known combinatorial problems like the traveling salesman problem. Games with imperfect information arise naturally when modeling situations involving multiple agents whose decisions cannot always be observed directly. For example, consider a group of people playing a board game together; it is often impossible to tell exactly who moved last because there may be several pieces involved in one move. Another common situation occurs in distributed systems, where different processes communicate indirectly via messages sent over an unreliable network.",1,0
"We present an anatomical study on the structure and evolution of malicious singularities in complex networks, which are defined as nodes that have a disproportionately large number of connections to other nodes. We show how these nodes can be identified by their topological properties using statistical mechanics methods. In particular we find that the degree distribution of such nodes follows a power law with exponent 2.5 ± 0.1 for all studied real-world networks ranging from social networks like Facebook or Twitter to biological networks like metabolic pathways or protein-protein interaction networks. This finding is consistent across different network sizes and types. The results presented here provide new insights into the organization principles of complex systems and may help to identify key players within them. Complex networks play a crucial role in many fields including physics, biology, sociology, computer science, engineering, economics, etc., where they represent interactions between entities [1] . A common feature of most complex networks is the presence of so-called 'hubs' -highly connected nodes [2] , whose removal often has dramatic effects [3] . In this work we focus on identifying hubs in complex networks based solely on their topological features. To do so, we use statistical mechanics techniques [4] to analyze the degree distributions of several real world networks [5] . Our analysis reveals that the degree distribution of hubs follows a power-law [6] with exponent 2.5±0.1 independently of the size and type of the considered network (see Fig.1 ). Interestingly, our findings are also valid when considering only the largest component of each network [7, 8] . These results suggest that the observed scaling behavior is not due to finite-size effects but rather reflects some fundamental property of complex networks [9] .",1,0
"We study the rational points on some families of K3 surfaces and abelian surfaces over finite fields, especially those with Picard number one or two.We prove that for any prime power q there are infinitely many primes p such that the Fermat curve F_q(x)=x^q+1-1 has no solutions in 𝔽_p (Theorem 1).This is done by showing that if p≠ q+1 then the equation x^q+1-1=y^p always has at least one solution in 𝔽_p^×.As an application we show how to construct infinite families of supersingular primes (Corollary 2).In Theorem 3 we give necessary conditions for the existence of a point of order m_1m_2 on an abelian surface A=E_1× E_2 where E_i are ordinary elliptic curves defined over a field K of characteristic zero....",1,0
We present the results of our study on milliarcsec (mas) scale radio morphologies for a sample of compact steep spectrum (CSS) objects using Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). The VLBA observations were carried out at 5 GHz in full polarization mode with an angular resolution of 0.5 mas and sensitivity better than 100 microJy beam-1 . We have detected all but one source in our sample which is unresolved by the VLBA. Our main findings are as follows:1. All the resolved sources show core-jet structure except two sources where we see only jet emission.2. Most of the jets appear to be straight or slightly bent towards north-east direction.3. There appears to be no correlation between the linear size and the position angle of the jet axis.4. A comparison of the observed flux density ratio between the core and the first component shows that most of these sources lie below the theoretical limit predicted by the standard model of relativistic beaming.,1,0
"We present the results of our analysis on simulated galaxy clusters, which are used to study how different physical processes affect SZ observables (profiles and scaling relations). We use hydrodynamical simulations performed with GADGET-2 code in order to investigate the effect of: gas clumping, AGN feedback, cooling flows, mergers, triaxiality and orientation of the cluster relative to observer's line-of-sight. The main conclusions are:- Gas clumpiness has an important impact on SZ observable quantities such as integrated Comptonization parameter Y500 or pressure profile P(r), especially at small radii.- Cooling flow regions have lower values for Y500 than expected by self-similar model predictions due to their low temperature and density compared to other parts of the cluster.- Mergers can significantly change the shape of the pressure profile leading to higher central pressures and steeper slopes towards outer parts.- Triaxiality affects both the amplitude and slope of the pressure profile depending on its orientation wrt. the observer's line-of-sigh.- Inclination angle between the major axis of the cluster and the observer's line-ofsight is one of the most significant factors affecting the observed properties of galaxy clusters.",1,0
"We present TRUFAS (Transit Recognition Using Fast Approximate Signatures), an efficient and robust transit search pipeline that uses fast approximate signatures to detect periodic signals in time series data. The method is particularly well suited for detecting short duration transits with high signal-to-noise ratio. We demonstrate its performance on simulated light curves generated by the Exoplanet Transit Database as well as real Kepler light curves. Our results show that TRUFAS can achieve higher efficiency than other algorithms while maintaining low false positive rates.Keywords: Transiting planet, Wavelets, Time-series analysis, False positives reduction, Planetary system characterization1 IntroductionPlanets are detected indirectly through their gravitational effects upon their host stars. These effects include changes in stellar radius or luminosity caused by the passage of planets across the line-of-sight between the star and Earth. This phenomenon is known as a transit event. In order to characterize exoplanet systems it is necessary to identify these events efficiently and accurately. However, this task has been made more difficult due to the large number of false positives produced by systematic noise sources such as instrumental artifacts and astrophysical phenomena like eclipsing binaries and pulsating stars.To date there have been several methods developed specifically for identifying transit-like features within astronomical time series data. Some examples include: Box Least Squares (BLS) [1] , BLS+ [2] , TrES [3] , TAP [4] , EXOTRANS [5] . While each of these techniques performs reasonably well under certain conditions they all suffer from one common drawback; they require significant computational resources when searching for multiple transit candidates simultaneously. For example, the most widely used technique, Box Least Squares, requires O(N3) operations where N is the length of the time series being analyzed [6] . As a result, many of these techniques cannot be applied directly to current and future surveys which will produce enormous amounts of data [7][8][9] .In recent years wavelet transforms have become increasingly popular for analyzing astronomical time series data [10][",1,0
"We present new results on the nature and geometry of the compact object in the gamma-ray binary system LS I +61 303, based on observations with the INTEGRAL satellite. We find that the source is variable at all wavelengths studied here (radio to hard X-rays), but shows no evidence for orbital modulation or eclipses. The X-ray spectrum can be described by either a power law model or thermal bremsstrahlung emission; both are consistent with previous studies. In addition we report the detection of pulsations in the radio band which have been previously reported only once before. These pulsations show up as periodic intensity variations in our data set, and their periodicity has been confirmed using two independent methods. Using these results together with those obtained from optical photometry and spectroscopy, we conclude that this source most likely contains a neutron star accreting matter from its companion Be-star via Roche lobe overflow.",1,0
"The projectile fragmentation of 86Kr at 64MeV/nucleon has been studied with the INDRA multidetector in inverse kinematics using an 8cm thick natK target and a beam intensity of 1nAe. The main results are as follows:- A total number of about 10000 events have been recorded for this experiment.- The charge distribution is peaked around Z=40, but shows also a large contribution between 30 and 40 charges units (see fig.1 ). This indicates that the fragments produced by the break-up of 86Kr are not only light particles like neutrons or protons, but contain many intermediate mass fragments too.- The angular distributions show two peaks corresponding to forward and backward emission respectively (see fig.2 ).- The energy spectra present a maximum around 10-12 MeV/u which corresponds to the most probable kinetic energy per nucleon of the emitted fragments (see fig.3 ). - The isotopic composition of the fragments is shown on figure 4 . It can be seen that there is no significant difference between the fragment production in the forward hemisphere and in the backward one.",1,0
"In this work, we study the fractal dimension and Hausdorff measure of the set of points whereis not differentiable in . We show that these measures are equal to one half times the corresponding values on the unit interval with Lebesgue measure.This result generalizes previous results by Jarník (for ) and Marstrand (for ). The proof relies on an explicit formula for the Fourier transform of , which was obtained recently by Fejér and Riesz. In addition, we prove that the same holds true if instead of the Lebesgue measure on the unit interval, we consider any other probability measure whose support has positive length. Finally, we give some applications of our main theorem to the theory of lacunary series. Let be the space of all complex-valued functions defined on the real line equipped with the topology of uniform convergence on compact subsets of .

"We present an analysis of gravitational wave signals produced by rotating stellar cores collapsing to black holes, using numerical relativity simulations performed with the Einstein Toolkit. We find that generic collapse models produce characteristic features in their gravitational waveforms which can be used as templates for matched filtering searches. These include (i) a precursor signal, (ii) a ringdown phase and (iii) a post-merger phase. The precursor is associated with the formation of a shock front at the surface of the core; it has been observed previously but its properties have not yet been studied systematically. In this work we show how these properties depend on the rotation rate of the progenitor star. For rapidly-rotating progenitors, the precursor signal contains multiple peaks whose frequencies are determined primarily by the spin frequency of the central object prior to merger. This suggests that such precursors could be detected even if they were emitted by binary neutron stars or black hole-neutron star systems where no information about the pre-merger spins would be available.",1,0
"We present Block Locally Optimal Precondioner for the solution of large sparse linear systems arising from discretized partial differential equations using Krylov subspace methods.The preconditioners are constructed by solving local eigenvalue problems on small subdomains, which can be done efficiently with parallel iterative solvers such as GMRES or BiCGSTAB. We show that these preconditioners have good convergence properties when used within an inexact Newton-Krylov-Schwarz method to solve nonlinear PDEs. In addition we demonstrate how this approach is implemented in two popular libraries, PETSc and hypre. Finally, we provide numerical results showing the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm. Keywords: Nonlinear PDE, Inexact Newton Method, Parallel Iterative Solver, Preconditioning, Subdomain Decomposition. 1 Introduction. The goal of this work is to develop efficient algorithms for solving large-scale nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). These algorithms will use domain decomposition techniques combined with parallel iterative solving strategies to construct effective preconditioners for the resulting linear system. Our focus here is on developing new approaches for constructing locally optimal block diagonal preconditioners based on the Schur complements associated with overlapping Schwarz methods. This type of preconditioner has been shown to perform well for many types of applications including convection-diffusion-reaction equations [19, 20] , Stokes flow [3, 4] , Maxwell's equations [6] , elasticity [7, 8] , and incompressible Navier-Stokes flows [9, 10] . However, there remain several challenges related to their construction and application. First, it is difficult to compute accurate approximations to the Schur complement matrices due to the presence of singularities at corners and edges of the computational domains. Second, the number of unknowns per subdomain increases rapidly as the problem size grows making direct factorization impractical. Third, the condition numbers of the Schur complement matrices grow exponentially fast with respect to the number of subdomains. Fourth, the cost of applying the preconditioner may become prohibitively expensive if one",1,0
"We have analyzed the pulse profiles in two energy bands (3-20 keV, 20-100 keV) for 4U0115+63 using data obtained by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). The results show that there is no significant difference between these two energy bands except at phase 0.7-0.9 where we see an excess emission above 100 keV. We also find that this source shows a double peaked profile with a dip around phase 0.5 which can be explained as due to absorption effects on the line-of-sight. In addition, we have used data from the International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL), which has detected cyclotrons lines near 30 keV and 60 keV respectively. Using our model parameters derived from the RXTE data analysis, we are able to reproduce both the observed pulse profiles and the cyclotrons line energies simultaneously.",1,0
"We study the incoherent transport properties of a strongly correlated electron system, namely the periodic Anderson model (PAM) with strong hybridization between conduction and localized electrons. We show that this PAM can be mapped onto an effective spinless fermion model which is equivalent to a disordered Fermi gas at low temperatures. The resulting density of states exhibits a pseudogap structure near the chemical potential. In addition we find that the resistivity shows a linear temperature dependence below some characteristic temperature T*. This behavior is consistent with recent experiments on heavy-fermion compounds such as Yb_1-xYbxCu_2Si2O_7-x. Finally, we discuss how our results are related to previous theoretical work based on the dynamical mean-field theory. PACS numbers: 71.27.+a, 72.25.+f, 74.78.+h",1,0
"The aim of this work is to study the effect of different assembly procedures, as well as different contact laws between particles in powder compaction processes using computer simulations. The results show that the packing density depends strongly on the applied pressure during the assembly process. In addition, it was found that the densification behavior can be influenced by changing the contact law parameters. Finally, we have shown how the microstructure evolves with increasing pressure for two different types of particle contacts. Powder compaction has been studied extensively over many years due to its importance in various industrial applications such as pharmaceutical tablets or metal parts produced via hot pressing techniques [1] . However, despite these efforts there are still open questions regarding the underlying mechanisms governing the densification behavior under external loads [2] . In order to understand the complex phenomena occurring inside compacted materials, several experimental studies were performed [3] , which revealed important information about the evolution of the microstructure [4] . Nevertheless, experiments cannot provide detailed insight into the local interactions taking place at the grain scale [5] . Therefore, numerical methods based on discrete element models (DEM) [6] became an alternative approach to investigate the mechanical properties of granular systems [7, 8] . These DEM-based approaches allow one to track individual grains within large assemblies and thus enable us to obtain valuable insights into the micromechanical response [9] . For example, recent investigations showed that the macroscopic stress-strain curve obtained from compression tests can be reproduced accurately if realistic inter-particle contact laws are used [10] .",1,0
"In this work, we study the throughput capacity region for multi-hop wireless networks with multiple transmitters and one receiver (MISO-MHWN). We first show that the MISO-MHWN is equivalent to an interference channel where each transmitter has only one antenna but can communicate simultaneously with all receivers in the network. Then, by using the concept of degrees-of-freedom (DoF), which characterizes how many parallel data streams are supported at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, we derive outer bounds on the DoF region of the MISO-MHWNS. Finally, based on these results, we propose a novel transmission scheme called 'Interference Alignment' (IA) to achieve the optimal DoF region. The proposed IA scheme exploits both spatial multiplexing gain as well as multiuser diversity gain. In particular, it allows different users to transmit their signals over non-overlapping time-frequency resources while maintaining full spatial reuse among them.",1,0
"We present an analysis of the Galactic latitude distribution of stars in the 2MASS survey, and find that it is well described by a superposition of two Gaussians with different widths. The narrower Gaussian has a mean latitude of -2^∘ , while the broader one peaks at +3^∘ . We show that this double-Gaussian model can be used to explain the observed latitude dependence of the number density fluctuations as measured by the power spectrum of the 2MASS all-sky map.In addition we demonstrate how our results are consistent with previous studies on the subject. Finally, using the derived parameters of the double-Gaussian model, we calculate the expected value of the quadrupole moment of the CMB temperature anisotropy induced by the Galaxy's gravitational potential. This calculation shows that the quadrupole moment predicted by the model agrees very well with recent measurements made by WMAP satellite.",1,0

"We study anonymity systems that operate over unstructured networks, such as Tor and Mixminion. We show how to construct mixes with provable guarantees against traffic analysis attacks by using only local information about the topology of the underlying network. Our construction is based on mixing small groups of users together at each node along their paths through the system. This approach allows us to achieve high levels of anonymity while maintaining low latency for most messages. In addition, we present several extensions to our basic scheme which allow it to be deployed more easily in practice. Finally, we evaluate our system both analytically and experimentally, showing that it achieves good performance under realistic conditions. Anonymity systems are used to protect user privacy when sending or receiving data over public communication channels. These systems typically consist of a set of nodes (called mixes) connected via some anonymous communication channel. Each message entering the system is encrypted multiple times before being sent out again; this process is called 'mixing'. The goal of these systems is to prevent attackers from linking senders and receivers of messages within the system. However, if all messages go through exactly the same sequence of mixes then they can still be linked using statistical techniques known as 'traffic analysis'. Traffic analysis has been shown to compromise the security of many existing anonymity systems including Tor [1] , Crowds [2] , Onion Routing [3] , Freenet [4] , and Mixminion [5] . To overcome this problem, researchers have proposed various approaches [6] - [8] . In this work, we focus on anonymity systems operating over unstructured networks [9]- [11] . Unstructured networks differ from traditional peer-to-peer networks [12] because there is no global knowledge available regarding the structure of the network. Instead, each node maintains only partial information about its immediate neighbors. For example, in the case of Tor [13] , each node knows only the identity of its direct neighbors but not those of other nodes further away. As another example, in Mixminion [14] , each node knows only whether two given nodes are directly connected or not",1,0
"We report the discovery and characterization of an unresolved binary system consisting of two late-type dwarf stars, SDSS J080531.8+481233.0AB (hereafter referred to as J0805+4812). The primary component is classified as a T6p dwarf star with a mass of70 MJup while its companion has been identified as a cool brown dwarf candidate with a temperature between 1000-2000 K. We have used high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy obtained at Gemini Observatory in order to confirm that both components are gravitationally bound. Our analysis shows that this object is one of the most massive known binaries composed by two low-mass objects.

"We study the effects of noise on spatially extended systems by using an extension of the concept of nonequilibrium potential (NEP). We show that NEPs can be used to characterize different types of stochastic resonances, such as those observed for excitable and bistable systems near their respective Hopf bifurcations. In particular we find that the presence of noise enhances the amplitude of oscillations in both cases but with very different mechanisms. For excitable systems this is due to the fact that noise increases the probability of crossing the threshold between two stable states; while for bistable systems it occurs because noise induces transitions between these states. Finally, we discuss how our results are related to previous studies based on other approaches. Stochastic resonance has been studied extensively during recent years [1] . It refers to the phenomenon whereby weak signals can be enhanced or detected more easily when they are embedded into a noisy background [2] . In many physical situations, however, one needs to consider not only the effect of external noise sources but also internal fluctuations arising from the dynamics itself [3] . This problem becomes particularly relevant if the signal-to-noise ratio is small [4] , which may occur either because the signal is intrinsically weak or because its intensity is comparable to the level of intrinsic noise [5] . Moreover, even though the signal is strong enough so that it could be clearly distinguished without any additional noise [6] , there might still exist some optimal amount of noise that maximizes the detection efficiency [7, 8] .",1,0
"We present the radio through X-ray spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for 38 quasars with broad absorption lines in their optical spectra, selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 5 quasar catalog and observed by Chandra and/or XMM-Newton. We find that these sources are typically characterized by steep radio to infrared continua, weak or absent emission lines at ultraviolet wavelengths, and strong soft excesses below 1 keV. The majority of our sample show evidence for significant intrinsic reddening as indicated by the presence of deep UV troughs and high values of the Balmer decrement. In addition, we detect several objects which exhibit extremely flat radio-to-X-ray slopes indicative of relativistic beaming effects. These results suggest that BAL quasars represent an important phase in the evolution of luminous active galactic nuclei during which they undergo rapid changes in physical conditions within their central regions. This is supported by recent theoretical models suggesting that BAL outflows may play an important role in regulating black hole growth via feedback processes.Keywords: Active Galactic Nuclei",1,0
"The structure and dynamics of lipid membranes are important for many biological processes, such as cell division or protein transport across the membrane. In this work we use atomic force microscopy to investigate the structural properties of stacked layers of phospholipids in water. We find that these structures form spontaneously on mica surfaces at room temperature within minutes after adding the lipids into solution. The height profiles show that the thicknesses of the individual layers vary between 1 nm and 2 nm depending on their composition. By analyzing the lateral diffusion coefficients of single molecules with respect to time, we can determine whether they are mobile or immobile. Our results indicate that the mobility is strongly dependent on the number of layers present in each stack. For example, while most of the molecules in one layer diffuse freely over large distances, those in two layers exhibit only small displacements perpendicular to the surface. This behavior suggests that the mobility decreases significantly when more than one layer forms.",1,0
"We present the first fully self-consistent, atomistic quantum transport calculations for ballistic graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with realistic band structure and electrostatic potential profiles using nonequilibrium Green's function formalism in combination with density functional theory (DFT). We show that the GNRs' electronic properties are strongly dependent on their widths as well as edge structures. The calculated current-voltage characteristics reveal several interesting features such as negative differential resistance at low bias voltages due to resonant tunneling through localized states near the Fermi level. In addition, we find that the presence of hydrogen passivation layers can significantly enhance the device performance by suppressing the backscattering effect caused by defects or impurities along the edges.Keywords: Ballistic transport, Graphene nanoribbon, Nonequilibrium Green's functions, Density functional theory, Quantum transport calculation. 1 IntroductionGraphene is an emerging material which has attracted considerable attention recently because it exhibits unique physical properties [1] . It consists of carbon atoms arranged into a honeycomb lattice where each carbon atom forms covalent bonds with three neighboring carbons [2] . Due to its two-dimensional nature, graphene shows high carrier mobility [3] , thermal conductivity [4] , mechanical strength [5] , optical transparency [6] , and flexibility [7] . These remarkable properties make graphene promising candidates for future nanoelectronic devices [8] .Graphene nanoribbons (G-NR), i.e., strips of graphene with finite width [9] , have been proposed as building blocks for various applications including transistors [10] , interconnects [11] , photodetectors [12] , solar cells [13] , sensors [14] , etc.. Compared to conventional silicon-based electronics [15] , GNRs offer many advantages [16] : they exhibit higher electron mobilities [17] ; they allow better control over the charge carriers [18] ; they provide more design freedom [19] ; and they enable new functionality [20] . However, there still exist some challenges associated with practical realization of GNRs [21] . For example, the fabrication process requires precise control of ribbon width [22] and edge roughness [23] . Moreover, the electrical properties of GNRs depend sensitively",1,0

"We have studied the ^p_d elastic scattering at low energies in order to extract information on the nucleon-nucleon interaction and its off-shell behavior.We used an effective Lagrangian approach with one-boson exchange potentials for the mesons, which are constrained by experimental data. The results obtained show that the inclusion of the pion-exchange potential is essential to reproduce correctly the phase shifts up to about 100 MeV/c.The analysis performed shows also that the contribution coming from the rho-meson exchange gives rise to a repulsive effect in the nuclear force, while the omega-meson exchange produces attractive effects. Finally we have calculated the cross section for the process^p_d→ ^p_dη using the same formalism as before. Our results agree well with those reported recently by other authors. In this work we present some new results concerning the calculation of the cross sections for the processes^p_d→ ^p_d ηand^p_d← ^p_d γ . These reactions can be considered as complementary probes of the nucleonnucleon interaction since they involve different spin states (scalar versus vector) and different orbital angular momenta (zero versus one).",1,0
"In this article, we prove sharp Lp estimates for the maximal operator associated with the surface measure on a closed convex surface in R3 when p>2.We also show that these results are optimal by constructing examples where the bounds cannot be improved. The main tool used is an extension theorem due to Coifman and Weiss which allows us to reduce matters to studying the case of surfaces contained in planes. This reduction leads naturally to consideration of certain singular integral operators whose kernels have been studied extensively over the past several decades. In particular, we use recent work of David Jerison and Michael Loss concerning the behavior of such operators near their singularities. Finally, we apply our results to obtain new information about the regularity properties of solutions to the Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation on bounded domains in R3. Our results can be viewed as extensions of earlier work done by Kenig and Stein who proved similar results for the unit sphere in R4.",1,0
"The concept of long-range order is central to the understanding of many physical phenomena, including phase transitions and critical behavior in statistical mechanics.In this article we present an analysis of the mathematical foundations for the study of such systems.We begin by introducing the notion of a measure-preserving transformation on a probability space (X, Σ, μ) as well as that of a measurable partition of X into subsets with equal probabilities.Next, we define the entropy H(T) associated with T as the supremum over all possible values of the Shannon information content of any finite collection of sets belonging to some fixed partition P of X.Finally, we introduce the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy hKS(T), which measures the rate at which information can be produced by observing the evolution of the system under consideration.The main result presented here shows how these two quantities are related through the use of conditional entropies.",1,0
"We report on new observations made with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) that reveal an extremely asymmetric distribution of dust around the young star HD 15115, located at a distance of about 150 light-years away in the constellation Pictor.The images show two bright lobes extending to distances greater than 100 AU and separated by more than 50 AU along the major axis of the system's circumstellar disk. We interpret these features as evidence for recent planet formation activity within this protoplanetary disk. This is one of only three known cases where such structures have been observed directly; all other examples are inferred indirectly through modeling or scattered-light imaging techniques. These results provide important constraints on models of planet formation and migration. In addition, we find no evidence for any significant amount of cold dust beyond 250 AU from the central star. Our findings suggest that the outer regions of protoplanetary disks may be cleared out much faster than previously thought.",1,0
"We report the detection of an infrared dark cloud (IRDC) in the vicinity of the open cluster NGC 6334, using data obtained with Spitzer Space Telescope's Infrared Array Camera (IRAC). The IRDC is associated with the molecular cloud complex G327.3+0.6 and has been identified as Bok globule CB190 by ClemensBarvainis (1988) . We find that this object exhibits a prominent 24 micron shadow which may be caused by absorption against bright mid-infrared emission from nearby protostars or young stellar objects. This feature suggests that the cloud contains dense cores at different evolutionary stages. Using near-infrared extinction mapping we identify two candidate starless cores within the cloud. These are located near the center of the cloud where the 24 micron shadow is most pronounced. Our analysis shows that these cores have masses between 0.5 Msun to 1 Msun and radii ranging from 1000 AU to 3000 AU .",1,0
"We present new measurements of the longitudinal polarization fraction f_L in B meson decays to ϕ K^* final states, using data collected by the Belle experiment at KEKB with an integrated luminosity of 711 fb-1. We measure f_L = 0.65 ± 0.04(stat) ± 0.03(syst), which is consistent with previous results and indicates that there are no large contributions from physics beyond the Standard Model.The measurement was performed on ^B_s →ϕ K^* events where one or both kaons were identified as charged pions (K+/-). This method allows for a precise determination of the decay time distribution without relying on Monte Carlo simulation techniques. Using this technique we find that the measured value of f_L does not depend strongly on the choice of fitting range used to extract it. In addition, we perform a study of systematic uncertainties associated with our analysis procedure.",1,0
We present an overview of our recent work on extracting information about physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) from B-decay data.We discuss how to extract the weak phase angle Δα = α_s - α_W in the SM from measurements of CP asymmetries in decays such as B →ππ using reparametrization invariance.This method is based on the fact that the decay amplitudes for these processes are invariant under certain transformations which leave their physical properties unchanged.The extracted value of Δα can then be compared with theoretical predictions obtained within specific extensions of the SM.We also show how this approach allows one to test whether new physics contributions to the decay amplitude violate or preserve flavor symmetry.Finally we comment on some of the difficulties associated with applying this technique experimentally. A more detailed discussion of these issues will appear elsewhere. [1][2] .[3][4],1,0
"We study how the presence of a central supermassive black hole (SMBH) affects the dynamical evolution and mass loss rate of an open cluster with N = 10, 000 stars in virial equilibrium. We use direct N-body simulations to follow the long-term evolution of this system for up to 1 Gyr. The SMBH is modeled as a point particle that interacts gravitationally only with the most bound particles of each star cluster orbiting it. Our results show that the presence of the SMBH causes significant changes in the structure of the open cluster over time. In particular, we find that:-The open cluster loses about half its initial total mass within 0.5 Gyr due to tidal stripping by the SMBH.-The open cluster becomes more spherical after being tidally stripped by the SMBH. -The open cluster develops a core-halo structure where the density profile follows a power law at large radii but has a flat distribution near the center.",1,0
"In this work, we propose an energy-efficient modulation scheme for downlink transmission over code division multiple access (CDMA) networks by exploiting the inherent multiuser diversity and delay requirements. We formulate the problem as a noncooperative game between users competing for limited power resources under their individual delay constraints. The proposed algorithm is shown to converge to Nash equilibrium points that are Pareto optimal solutions to the formulated optimization problems. Numerical results show that our approach can significantly improve system performance compared to existing schemes. In particular, it achieves higher data rates while maintaining low outage probabilities at different signal-to-noise ratios.Keywords: Code Division Multiple Access, Noncooperative Games, Power Allocation, Energy Efficiency, Multiuser Diversity, Delay Constraint. 1 IntroductionWith the rapid growth of wireless communication systems such as mobile phones and personal digital assistants, there has been increasing interest in developing efficient resource allocation algorithms to maximize network capacity or minimize total transmit power consumption [1] . For example, [2] considers joint subcarrier and bit allocations among users in orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based broadband wireless networks using Lagrangian relaxation techniques; [3] proposes a distributed algorithm based on dual decomposition theory to solve the sum-power minimization problem subject to rate constraints in OFDMA cellular networks; [4] develops a low-complexity iterative water-filling algorithm to optimize the tradeoff between spectral efficiency and fairness in multi-cell OFDMA networks. However, these works do not consider user-specific delay requirements which may be important in some applications like voice communications. To address this issue, [5] presents a cross-layer design framework where packet scheduling decisions are made jointly across physical layer, MAC layer, and application layer according to both channel conditions and end-to-end delay requirements. [6] studies the problem of maximizing the weighted sum-rate of all users in a single-cell uplink scenario with per-user delay constraints. It shows that the resulting optimization problem is NP-hard and then solves it via convex programming methods. Although these works have considered various aspects of resource allocation in wireless networks, they",1,0
"We present an overview of our recent work on Bayesian methods for reconstructing the large scale structures in the universe using galaxy redshift surveys. We discuss how to formulate this problem as a statistical inference task with priors that encode physical information about the underlying matter distribution. The posterior probability density function is then evaluated by applying Bayes' theorem together with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling techniques. In particular we focus on two different approaches which are based either on Gibbs sampling or Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Finally we describe some applications of these methods to simulated data sets. This research was supported by NSF grant AST-0707763. Cosmology has been revolutionized over the past decade by precision measurements of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies made by WMAP [1] , PLANCK [2] and other experiments [3] . These observations have provided strong evidence for the existence of dark energy [4] and have led to tight constraints on many parameters describing the physics of the early universe [5] . However, despite their successes there remain several open questions regarding fundamental aspects of the standard model of cosmology [6] . One such question concerns the nature of dark matter [7, 8] : what is its particle content? What is its mass? How does it interact with ordinary matter? Answering these questions requires detailed knowledge of the spatial distribution of dark matter throughout space and time [9] . Unfortunately direct detection experiments [10] cannot provide this information because they only measure the gravitational effects of dark matter particles [11] . Instead one must rely on indirect probes like galaxy clustering [12] , weak lensing [13] and 21 cm emission [14] .",1,0
"We report on an unexpected reversal of temperatures between two components of a brown-dwarf eclipsing binary system, which we have discovered using infrared photometry and spectroscopy obtained with Spitzer Space Telescope (Werner et al., 2004) and Gemini Observatory (Gemini North telescope). The primary component is cooler than its secondary by about 300 K at optical wavelengths but warmer by about 100 K at near-infrared wavelengths. We find that this temperature inversion can be explained if both stars are irradiated by their mutual accretion disk. This finding suggests that the disks around young low-mass objects may be more complex than previously thought.Keywords: Accretion Disk, Inverse P-Cygni profile, Irradiation, Low-Mass Star, Near-Infrared Spectroscopy, Photometric variability, Stellar radius, Temperature inversion, Young star1 IntroductionAn important goal for understanding how planets form is to determine what happens during the earliest stages of planet formation when protoplanetary disks surround young stellar systems. One key question concerns whether or not these disks evolve into planetary systems like our own solar system. To answer such questions it will be necessary to study individual examples of young circumstellar disks as they evolve over time. However, because most young stars are deeply embedded within dense molecular clouds, direct observations of the inner regions of these disks are difficult. Fortunately, some young stars are surrounded by optically thin dusty envelopes that allow us to probe the physical conditions near the central object through scattered light. These so-called transitional disks show evidence of clearing out large amounts of material inside several AU of the central star while still retaining significant quantities of gas farther away (Strom et al., 1989; Skrutskie et al., 1990; Calvet et al., 2002; Muzerolle et al., 2003; Sicilia-Aguilar et al., 2006; Espaillat et al., 2007) .A number of studies suggest that the outer edges of transitional disks are sculpted by photoevaporative winds driven off the surface of the disk by intense ultraviolet radiation from nearby",1,0
"We study the elasticity of thin films with periodic microstructure, which are constrained to lie on an underlying substrate. We show that such systems can exhibit anomalously large values for their Young's moduli as well as Poisson ratios. The origin of these effects is traced back to the presence of phonon soft modes associated with the periodicity along the film normal direction. These results have implications for the design of novel materials with tailored elastic properties.In recent years there has been growing interest in understanding how confinement affects the physical behavior of matter at the nanoscale [1] . This problem arises naturally when considering thin films or nanowires embedded within bulk materials; however it also applies more generally whenever a system is restricted to occupy only part of its available phase space [2] . For example, this situation occurs frequently during crystal growth where defects may be introduced into the lattice structure by impurities [3] , or when studying colloidal suspensions [4] .In this work we consider the case of a thin film with periodic microstructure, whose thickness h lies between two length scales L and d (see Fig 1) . Here L represents the typical size of the unit cell while d denotes the characteristic spacing between adjacent layers; both quantities are assumed to be much smaller than the in-plane dimensions of the sample. Such structures arise commonly in nature, e.g., in layered compounds like graphite [5] , transition metal dichalcogenides [6] , and hexagonal boron nitride [7] . They are also used extensively in technological applications ranging from photovoltaics [8] to optoelectronics [9] .Figure 1: Schematic illustration of our model geometry.

"We present an optical source catalog for the north ecliptic pole region (NEPR) based on data obtained with the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS-II). The NEPR is defined as the area within 10 degrees in right ascension and declination centered at RA = 20 h 00 m , Dec = +85 deg . We have used POSS-II plates taken between 1950 and 1990 to produce this catalog, which contains over 1 million sources down to B J = 22 mag . The photometric calibration was performed using Landolt standard stars observed during the same nights that the sky survey plates were exposed. Photometry has been carried out by means of aperture photometry techniques. Magnitudes are given in the Johnson system. In addition we provide proper motions for all objects brighter than B J = 18 mag .

"We present an approach to the analysis of metabolic networks based on information-theoretic concepts, in particular Shannon's entropy measure. We show that this concept can be extended by considering not only single metabolites but also pairs or higher-order tuples of them as elementary units for measuring entropy. This leads us to define so-called pathway entropies which are used to quantify how much uncertainty is associated with different parts of the network. The proposed method allows one to identify those parts of the network where most of the uncertainty resides. In addition we introduce a novel way of visualizing metabolic networks using these new entropy-based quantities. Finally, we demonstrate our approach by applying it to two examples taken from biochemistry literature. Metabolic networks play important roles in many biological processes such as cell growth and development [1] . They consist of chemical reactions transforming various compounds into each other [2] , e.g., glucose molecules are transformed into energy-rich adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules via glycolysis [3] . The study of metabolic networks has been attracting increasing interest over recent years [4] - [8] . One reason for this growing interest lies in their potential use as drug targets [9] . Another motivation comes from the fact that they provide valuable insights into cellular metabolism [10] . For example, the identification of key enzymes involved in certain diseases may help to develop drugs against these diseases [11] . Furthermore, metabolic networks have been shown to exhibit scale-free properties [12] similar to those observed in social systems [13] . These findings suggest that there might exist common principles underlying both types of networks [14] . In order to understand the functioning of metabolic networks better, several mathematical models have been developed [15] - [17] . Amongst others, stoichiometric approaches [18] try to describe all possible states of a given metabolic system mathematically. However, due to the high number of degrees of freedom inherent in such models [19] , it becomes difficult to analyze large metabolic networks [20] . Therefore, alternative methods have been suggested [21] - [23] .",1,0
"We propose an explicit microscopic model for the recently proposed massive CP^1 theory, which is based on the idea that the Higgs field arises as a collective mode in strongly correlated systems with spontaneously broken symmetry.We show how this can be realized by considering a system of fermions coupled to bosonic degrees of freedom via a four-fermion interaction term and derive the effective action for the Higgs field. The resulting Higgs potential has two degenerate minima corresponding to the vacuum expectation values ⟨ H ⟩ = ± v_0 where v_0 ∼ J (the strength of the coupling between the fermions and bosons) and J > 0 is determined self-consistently within our approach. In addition we find that there are no massless excitations associated with the Higgs field. Finally, we discuss possible experimental realizations of such a scenario using cold atoms or trapped ions. Introduction - Recently it was suggested [1] that the Standard Model Higgs field may arise as a collective mode in a class of strongly correlated systems with spontaneusly broken symmetry. This proposal relies on the observation [2] that the Higgs mechanism can be understood as arising from the condensation of bound states of fermions into bosonic particles [3] . It follows then that if one could engineer a system of fermions interacting with some other degree(s) of freedom so that these bound states condense, then one would have spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetry and hence a Higgs-like state. A concrete realization of this idea was given in Ref. [4] , where it was shown that the Higgs field emerges naturally when one considers a system of fermions with spin-1/2 coupled to bosonic degrees",1,0
"We propose to connect the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) with an International Linear Collider (ILC), which will be built in Japan or Korea, by using quintessence as dark energy.We show that this connection is possible if we assume that the universe has been expanding at a constant rate for about 10 billion years since its birth. The expansion speed of the universe can then be determined by measuring the time delay between signals emitted simultaneously from distant galaxies observed today and those emitted from them when they were closer together during their youthful days. This measurement would provide us with information on how much dark energy there was back then. If our proposal turns out to be correct, it may lead to new insights into the nature of dark energy. In addition, it could also shed light on why the universe looks so different now than what it looked like just after its birth. It might even help explain why the universe appears to have evolved in such a way that life forms are able to exist here on Earth.",1,0
"We present new near-infrared photometric data for the Pleiades open cluster obtained with the Infrared Survey Facility (IRSF) on the South African Astronomical Observatory's 1-m telescope at Sutherland in November 2005. The observations were made using the IRSF/SIRIUS camera which has simultaneous JHK s imaging capability over an 8 x8 field-of-view. We have also used archival 2MASS data to supplement our sample. Our results are presented as colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), where we show that there is good agreement between our photometry and previous studies. Using these CMDs, we identify several previously unreported candidate members of the Pleiades based upon their location relative to theoretical pre-main sequence evolutionary tracks. These candidates include two objects located near the substellar boundary, one of which appears to be a brown dwarf member of the Pleiades.",1,0
"The Standard Model (SM) is an extremely successful theory, but it has some problems that need to be addressed before we can claim to have found 'theory of everything'.The SM does not explain why there are three generations of quarks and leptons with different masses or how neutrinos acquire mass. It also fails to provide any explanation for dark matter in our universe.In this talk I will discuss my recent work on addressing these issues by introducing new particles into the SM which interact only gravitationally. These new particles are called gravitons and they carry spin-2 quantum number like graviton in general relativity. We show that if gravitons exist then their interactions with other fields lead to generation dependent masses for fermions as well as small Majorana masses for neutrinos. Gravitons also contribute to the energy density of the universe leading to possible solution to the problem of missing dark matter. Finally, we argue that gravitons may play important role in understanding hierarchy between Planck scale and electroweak scale.",1,0
"We have obtained deep optical spectra for eight QSOs with known redshifts in the range 0.4-0.5, and searched them for intervening Ca II absorbers using the equivalent width (EW) method. We find that all eight QSOs show strong Ca II absorptions associated with their own galaxy halos. The EWs are found to be correlated with the luminosities of the QSOs themselves. This correlation is consistent with previous results on Mg II absorbers but not with those on C IV absorbers. In addition we find that there exists an anti-correlation between the EWs and the impact parameters of the absorber-galaxy pairs. These results suggest that the Ca II absorbers may arise mainly from gaseous disks surrounding massive elliptical galaxies rather than from galactic winds driven by starburst activity.Keywords: Absorber-galaxy pairs; Galaxy halo; Quasar; Redshift",1,0
"Gravitational wave astronomy is an emerging field that will provide new insights into the universe and its fundamental laws through observations of gravitational waves emitted by merging black holes, neutron stars or other compact objects in distant galaxies.In this work we present several tests of different techniques used to select between competing models describing the observed data. We consider two examples where the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the detected signals are low enough so that it becomes difficult to distinguish between different physical scenarios using standard frequentist hypothesis testing methods. The first example considers the problem of distinguishing between binary black hole systems with spin aligned versus anti-aligned with their orbital angular momentum vector. The second example considers the problem of determining whether a given source has been emitting gravitational radiation continuously over time as opposed to being active only during short bursts. For both cases we compare results obtained using three different model selection methods: Akaike's information criterion (AIC), Bayes factors computed via nested sampling (NS-BF), and the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC).",1,0
"We propose a new inflationary model, which is based on the idea that there are two scalar fields in nature and they interact with each other through their potentials. We call this model 'smooth hybrid inflation' (SHI). In SHI, one field plays the role of the waterfall field while another field acts as an inflaton. The potential for our model has three parameters; we show how these parameters can be fixed by using observational data such as WMAP7+BAO+H0. Our results indicate that the tensor-to-scalar ratio r=0.0055+0.0005-0.0004 at 95",1,0
"The present work is devoted to the study of quantum mechanics in polymer chains, which are modeled as one-dimensional systems with nearest-neighbor interactions between particles.We consider two different models for such systems:The first model describes an ensemble of interacting fermions on a chain; it can be viewed as a generalization of the Hubbard model (which corresponds to spinless fermions) to include spin-dependent hopping amplitudes and repulsive interaction terms.In this case we show that there exists a critical value U_c of the interaction strength above which the ground state energy per particle becomes negative.This result implies that the ground state of the system undergoes a phase transition at U = U_c from a metallic-like phase into an insulating phase.The second model considered here consists of bosons moving along a ring subject to periodic boundary conditions.Here we prove rigorously that the ground-state energy per particle converges to zero when the number N of particles tends to infinity.Moreover, we provide upper bounds on the rate of convergence towards the limit.These results imply that the ground state of our system exhibits superfluid behavior.",1,0
"We present results for the masses of light mesons made up of quarks in different flavors, using domain-wall valence fermions on N f = 2 + 1 flavor staggered sea configurations generated by MILC collaboration at lattice spacing a ∼ 0.12 fm.We use two methods to extract the masses:The first method is based on fitting the correlation functions directly to exponentials.In this case we find that the mixed meson masses are systematically lower than those obtained from single exponential fits to the corresponding correlators.This effect can be explained as an artifact due to excited state contamination.To remove it, we fit the data simultaneously to three exponentials (two ground states and one excited state) and obtain consistent values for all the masses within statistical errors.For the second method, we calculate the effective masses of the mixed mesons and then perform a linear extrapolation to infinite time separation.Again, our results agree well with each other.Finally, we compare our results with experimental measurements and previous calculations performed with Wilson-type fermions.",1,0
"We present the results on searches for new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) in ttbar events at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV, using data collected by ATLAS during 2011 corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.7 fb-1 . The analysis is performed with three different final states: lepton+jets , dilepton and all-hadronic channels. We consider two types of models that can be tested with these analyses: vector-like quarks decaying into tWb or tbHq final states. In both cases we use simplified models where only one coupling parameter is varied while keeping others fixed to their SM values. No significant deviations are observed compared to the predictions based on the SM. Limits are set on the parameters describing the interactions between heavy particles and fermions. These limits improve upon previous measurements made at LEP2 and LHC Run I.The ATLAS Collaboration",1,0
"We report on the X-ray properties of the young, nearby (d = 11 pc), low-mass binary system 2MASS J1101-2677AB discovered by Burgasser et al. (2007) .

We observed this target for about 50 ks using Chandra ACIS-S in order to search for evidence of coronal activity associated with either or both components. No significant emission was detected at the position of the source down to a 3-sigma upper limit of 1 x 10^28 erg s-1 cm-2 . This non-detection suggests that if there are active regions present they must be small and/or cool compared to those found on more massive stars. In addition we find no evidence of flaring behavior during our observation which constrains any possible magnetic field strength to less than 100 G.",1,0
"We study the dynamic properties of molecular motors by using burnt-bridge models, which are simple kinetic Monte Carlo simulations for motor proteins such as kinesin and myosin V. We show that these models reproduce several experimental results on single-molecule experiments with high accuracy.In particular, we find that the velocity distribution is well described by an exponential function at low load force but deviates from it when the load increases. The mean square displacement shows subdiffusive behavior under large loads. These behaviors can be explained by considering the effect of the elasticity of the cargoes carried by the motors. Our model also reproduces the dependence of stall forces on external viscous drag coefficients observed experimentally. Finally, our simulation results suggest that the number of steps taken per ATP hydrolysis cycle decreases exponentially with increasing load force. This result may explain why the step size fluctuation becomes larger than expected theoretically near stalling conditions.I. INTRODUCTIO N Molecular motors play important roles in many biological processes including muscle contraction [1] , vesicle transport [2] , chromosome segregation [3] , and cell division [4] . They convert chemical energy into mechanical work through repeated cycles of binding to cytoskeletal filaments (e.g., microtubules) and releasing them [5] . The most extensively studied class of molecular motors is the kinesins [6] . Kinesins walk along microtubules toward their plus ends [7, 8] . Myosins move towards actin filaments' minus ends [9] . Both types of motors have been shown to take discrete steps [10 -12] . Recent studies have revealed that both kinesins [13] and myosins [14] exhibit stochastic stepping motions even without external loads [15 -19] . It has been suggested that this randomness arises mainly due to thermal fluctuations [20, 21] or internal noise [22] . However, there still remain open questions about how they respond to external loads [23] . In order to understand the mechanism underlying the operation of molecular motors, various theoretical approaches have been developed so far [24] . Among those methods, kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations [25] provide useful information on",1,0
"The hole spectra characteristics are investigated for the superlattices (SLs) with different aluminum contents by using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory. The results show that the valence band maximum is located at Γ point, while conduction band minimum locates at M point. With increasing x value, the energy gap decreases gradually due to the increase of electronegativity difference between GaN and AlN layers. In addition, we find that there exists an obvious charge polarization effect in SLs which leads to the formation of electric field inside the SLs. This electric field causes the splitting of heavy-hole subband into two parts near Fermi level. Furthermore, it can be seen clearly that the split-off bands move towards lower energies as x increases. Finally, the calculated effective masses of holes decrease slightly when x changes from 0.25 to 1.0.Keywords: AlGaInN/GaN superlattice; Charge polarization",1,0
"The present work is devoted to the study of nonlinear generalized functions in connection with the foundations of quantum field theory (QFT).

"We present the results of three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of accretion disks around black holes, which include both gas pressure and radiation pressure as well as self-gravity. We find that the surface density distribution is not smooth but shows spiral arms at radii where the disk becomes optically thick to its own emission. The spiral structure arises because of gravitational instability caused by the rapid increase of the Toomre Q parameter when the disk becomes optically thin. In addition we show that the radial velocity dispersion increases rapidly near the inner edge of the annulus due to shocks produced there. This may be responsible for producing broad line profiles observed in some AGNs.Keywords: Black hole -accretion disk systems; Hydrodynamics; Self-gravitation; Shock waves; Gravitational instabilities; Opacity effects1 IntroductionIt has been suggested that many active galactic nuclei (AGN) are powered by supermassive black holes (SMBHs). A SMBH can grow through mass accretion onto it via an accretion disk surrounding the central object. Since the discovery of quasars more than 30 years ago, observations have shown that most AGNs exhibit double-humped broad-line profiles in their optical spectra (e.g., [1; 2]), indicating that they contain rotating accretion disks [3] . However, theoretical models predict that such disks should become unstable if they rotate too fast [4] , so how do these objects maintain stability? One possible explanation is that the disks are supported against gravity by magnetic fields [5] or relativistic jets [6] .In this Letter, we study the properties of accretion disks using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations including both gas pressure and radiation pressures as well as self-gravity [7–9] . Our main goal here is to investigate whether the surface density distribution of the disk is smooth or exhibits spiral structures. If the latter case occurs, then what causes them? 2 Model DescriptionModel Setup The basic equations governing our model are given by:",1,0
"We calculate the bulk viscosity for a strongly interacting fermion system at finite temperature and density using the relaxation time approximation (RTA). We find that the RTA is not applicable to the case where the chemical potential μ approaches zero, because the relaxation rate vanishes as 1/μ^2. In this regime we use an alternative approach based on the Kubo formula with the spectral function obtained by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation numerically. The results show that the bulk viscosity increases rapidly near the critical point due to the enhancement of the relaxation rate caused by the increase of the effective mass. This behavior can be understood intuitively within the framework of Landau's theory of second-order phase transitions. Finally, we discuss how our result could be used to study the dynamics of neutron stars. Bulk viscosity plays an important role in understanding the damping mechanism of pulsar glitches.In recent years there has been considerable interest in studying the properties of dense nuclear matter such as quark-gluon plasma or color-flavor-locked (CFL) state [1] . It was suggested [2] that the bulk viscosity may play an important role in explaining the observed rapid spin-down of young pulsars [3] , which cannot be explained by conventional mechanisms [4] .In this Letter, we present numerical calculations of the bulk viscosity for a CFL superfluid at finite temperatures and densities. Our calculation is performed in the relaxation-time-approximation (RTA), which is valid when the relaxation rate is much larger than the typical frequency scale of the problem [5] . However, it turns out that the relaxation rate decreases very quickly as one moves towards lower temperatures [6] . Therefore, the applicability of the RTA becomes questionable if the chemical potential μ≪ T [7, 8] . To overcome this difficulty, we employ another method based on the Kubo formalism [9] .The rest of this Letter is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we briefly review the basic idea behind the RTA.

"We study the non-perturbative corrections to the low-energy effective action for type IIB string theory on Calabi-Yau threefolds with fluxes, using mirror symmetry techniques. We show that these corrections can be organized into an exact expression which is modular invariant under SL(2,Z).

"We revisit the question whether or not there is an excess in cosmic ray flux near Supernova Remnant (SNR) shells, as reported by PAMELA and AMS-02 experiments. We find that this excess can be explained within uncertainties if one assumes that SNRs accelerate particles with a power law spectrum up to energies above 10^15 eV. The required spectral index for protons is 2.2 +/- 0.1 which agrees well with theoretical expectations based on diffusive shock acceleration theory. For electrons we require a harder spectrum with a slope of 3.0 +/- 0.3. This result implies that either the electron-to-proton ratio decreases rapidly at high energy or that most of the observed CREs are secondary products produced via interactions between accelerated hadrons and background gas. In addition, our results suggest that the total number density of CRs around SNRs should be higher than previously estimated.",1,0
"We have recently shown that the primordial spectrum of density fluctuations can be obtained by solving an initial value problem for a massless scalar field in deSitter space-time, which is known as the cosmological slingshot effect (CSE).

We find that our model fits well within 1-sigma error bars on all parameters except n_s, where it lies just outside 2-sigma limits. The best-fit values are given by:H_0 = 72.6 +/- 0.9 km/s/Mpc,Omega_m = 0.26 +/- 0.01,Omega_Lambda = 0.74 +/- 0.02,n_s = 0.96 +/- 0.06.These results agree very well with recent measurements made using Type Ia supernovae.Our analysis shows that the CSE provides a viable alternative explanation for the origin of cosmic structure formation.",1,0
"We study the structure of the stationary distribution for an asymmetric version of the Target Process (TP). The TP is a continuous-time Markov chain on the integers, which has been introduced by Aldous and Pitman in their seminal work [1] . It can be seen as a model for the evolution of a population with immigration and emigration at fixed rates. In this article we consider a generalization where individuals are allowed to emigrate only if they have reached some threshold value k ∈ N 0 , i.e., the number of immigrants per unit time decreases linearly when the current size of the population increases beyond k. We show that under mild conditions there exists a unique stationary distribution π = (π(n)) n∈N0 such that π(k) > 0 holds true. Moreover, we prove that π satisfies a recursion formula similar to the one obtained for the original TP. Finally, we provide explicit expressions for π(1), ..., π(k+1).

"We analyze the evolution and kinematics of two opposite polarity magnetic features (MPFs) in an active region using high-resolution vector magnetograms obtained by Hinode/SOT-SP. The MPF pair is found to be associated with a coronal loop system that forms a 'U-shape' when viewed along its axis, which we refer to as the 'U-loop' model. We find that both MPFs are rooted at different depths below the solar surface; one MPF has a stronger field strength than the other but they have similar sizes. Both MPFs show outward motions away from their common center point during the time period studied here. In addition, there exists a counterclockwise rotation motion between these two MPFs. These results suggest that the MPF pair may evolve into a bipolar sunspot through flux cancellation processes. This work was supported by NASA grants NNX08AQ85G and NNG09FA40C.",1,0
"We consider the problem of finding the statistics of nodal lines in random wave fields, where we assume that the field is generated by an ensemble of monochromatic waves with randomly distributed phases and amplitudes. We show how to calculate these statistics using only the first two moments of the distribution function for the phase differences between pairs of waves. The results are applied to study the statistical properties of nodal lines on the surface of oceanic internal tides. In particular, it is shown that the probability density functions (PDFs) of the number of intersections per unit length of a reference curve depend strongly on whether or not this curve lies within one wavelength of the source region. If so, then the PDF has a power-law tail at large values of the intersection density; if not, then there is no such tail.Keywords: Random wave fields, Oceanic internal tide, Nodal line, Phase difference",1,0
"We present broadband (radio to X-ray) observations of GRB 061121, one of the most energetic gamma-ray bursts ever detected by Swift/BAT with an isotropic equivalent energy release of 1.8 x 10^54 erg in the 15-350 keV band. The temporal behavior of this event was complex; it consisted of multiple pulses that were superimposed on top of each other during both the prompt emission phase as well as the early part of its afterglow. We find evidence for two distinct components in the optical light curve -one which decays rapidly at first but then flattens out later-on timescales ranging between 0.1-10 days post-burst. This flattening could be due either to continued activity of the central engine or to refreshed shocks. In addition we detect significant radio emission upto 100 days post-burst. Our results are consistent with those obtained using data from the VLA and ATCA telescopes.",1,0
"In this article, we study the maximum solution to the normalized Ricci flow on closed 4-manifolds with positive scalar curvature and prove that it is unique up to scaling if its volume growth rate satisfies some conditions.We also show that there are no nontrivial steady or expanding solitons for the normalized Ricci flow in dimension four. Finally, we give an example which shows that our results do not hold without assuming positivity of scalar curvature. Keywords: Maximum solution, normalized Ricci flow, uniqueness, volume growth rate, scalar curvature. 1 Introduction Let (M,g) be a closed Riemannian manifold of dimension n. The Ricci flow is defined byg_t=e^-2tg where t∈[0,∞[. It was introduced independently by Hamilton [H1] and by Perelman [P] . In particular, Hamilton proved that any compact 3-manifold admits a metric of constant sectional curvature under the Ricci flow (see [H1, H2] ). On the other hand, Perelman showed that the Ricci flow can be used as a tool to solve the Poincaré conjecture and the Thurston geometrization conjecture (see [P] ) . Recently, Cao [Cao3] studied the behavior of the Ricci flow near singularities and proved that the limit space at infinity has finite topological type. Moreover, he gave examples showing that the limit spaces may have different topologies even when they share the same volume growth rates. For more information about the Ricci flow, see e.g., [WZ1, WZ2, ZH, CW1, CW2, CC, CLN, LY, YL, LL, LS, LT, MT, N, NW, OW, P, PS, S, SZ, T, V, X, Y, Z] .

"We present an approach to primordial evolution based on the finitary process soup (FPS) model, which is a generalization of the standard quantum field theory. The FPS consists of all possible finite sequences of elementary processes that can be constructed by applying a set of basic operations to a given initial sequence. We show how this formalism allows one to describe and analyze various aspects of primordial evolution such as entropy production, particle creation, time dilation etc., using only few parameters characterizing the initial state. In particular we demonstrate that the FPS provides a natural description for the inflationary scenario with no need to introduce additional fields or particles beyond those already existing within the Standard Model. Finally, we discuss some open problems related to our approach. PACS numbers: 04.60.Kz, 11.10.Wx, 12.20.Ds, 98.80.Cq .I. INTRODUCTORY REMARkSThe idea behind the finitary process soup [1] , also known as the 'quantum soup' [2] , is very simple - it represents any physical system as a collection of all its possible states. This concept has been used successfully in many areas of physics including statistical mechanics [3] , condensed matter [4] , nuclear [5] and atomic [6] physics, cosmology [7, 8] , quantum gravity [9] , string theory [10, 11] . In this work we apply the FPS formalism to study primordial evolution during the early stages of the universe's expansion. Our main goal will be to develop a general framework allowing us to describe different phenomena associated with the Big Bang without introducing new degrees of freedom not included into the Standard Model [12] . As we shall see below, the FPS naturally leads to a description of the inflationary scenario [13] where the inflaton field [14] emerges as a consequence of the underlying dynamics rather than being introduced ad hoc.II. THE FINITARY PROCESS SOUP MODEL AND ITS APPLICATION TO PRIMORDIAL EVOLUTION A. General Description Let us start by briefly reviewing the key features of the FPS formalism",1,0
"We propose that the two branches in the mass distribution of neutron stars are due to different mechanisms for their formation, with one branch being formed by accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of white dwarfs into neutron stars, while another is formed through core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). We show how this scenario can explain both the existence of massive pulsars as well as the absence of such objects in the observed sample of CCSNe remnants. The proposed model also explains why there have been no successful attempts so far at detecting gravitational waves emitted during AIC events. In addition we argue that our model provides an explanation for the apparent discrepancy between the masses inferred from observations of binary systems containing black holes or neutron stars on one hand, and those inferred from measurements of the radii of isolated neutron stars on the other. Finally, we discuss possible observational tests which could be used to verify our hypothesis.",1,0
"The Axion Dark Matter Search (ADMX) experiment is designed to search for dark matter in the form of axions, which are hypothetical particles predicted by theories beyond the Standard Model.The ADMX experiment consists of two main components: an antenna and a microwave cavity system that can be tuned over a wide range of frequencies.In this thesis we present results obtained with the first phase of the experiment using data taken between September 2005 and March 2007.We report limits on the coupling strength of axions to photons as well as limits on the mass of axions produced via Primakoff conversion inside a strong magnetic field.These results improve upon previous experimental bounds by more than one order of magnitude. This work was performed under the auspices of the U.S Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344. The Axion Dark Matter Search experiment is designed to search directly for dark matter in the universe in the form of axionic particles.

"The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) has revolutionized our understanding of blazar jets by providing unprecedented sensitivity to gamma rays above 100 MeV. The LAT is now routinely detecting flaring activity at GeV energies that are not seen with previous instruments such as EGRET on CGRO or AGILE/GRID. This new data allows us to probe deeper into the physics of these objects than ever before.In this talk I will discuss how we can use the upcoming generation of space-based observatories - including GLAST and EXIST - to study blazars over an even broader energy range. These missions promise to provide detailed information about the physical processes occurring within relativistic jets through observations across many decades in photon energy. We will also explore some of the exciting science questions that could be addressed using these facilities.

"We present the first simultaneous broadband (0.5-10 keV) spectral analysis of the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary system 4U 1728-34 using data obtained with XMM-Newton, Chandra, Suzaku, Swift-XRT and RXTE. We find that the source spectrum is well described by an absorbed blackbody plus power-law model in all observations except for one observation where we detect emission lines at 6.7 and 7.1 keV which are consistent with being produced by highly ionized iron. The temperature of the blackbody component varies between 0.6-0.9 keV while its radius ranges between 3-7 km depending on whether or not the absorption column density was allowed to vary freely during fitting. In addition, we also found evidence for a soft excess below 1 keV in some of our spectra. Using these results as input parameters, we simulated light curves based on the continuum models used in this work. Our simulations show that the observed flux variations can be explained solely due to changes in the blackbody normalization factor without requiring any additional variability mechanism such as obscuration effects.",1,0
"We study the gravitational field equations for static spherically symmetric configurations on Randall-Sundrum type II brane-worlds with bulk cosmological constant and matter fields localized on the branes. We show that, under certain conditions, these solutions can be interpreted as black holes embedded into an anti-de Sitter space-time. In particular we find that there is no restriction to the mass parameter M0 appearing in the solution of the vacuum Einstein equation on the brane. The corresponding horizon radius r0 satisfies the relation r0 = (3M0/4π)1/3. This result implies that the Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric describes not only black hole but also naked singularity solutions. Finally, we discuss how this picture changes when one takes into account quantum corrections due to loop effects. PACS numbers: 04.20.-q; 11.10.KkSupersymmetry has been proposed as a possible extension of general relativity which could provide a consistent description of gravity at all scales [1] . It was shown recently [2] , however, that it does not lead to any new predictions if applied to standard four-dimensional theories. On the other hand, higher dimensional extensions of supergravity have attracted considerable attention during recent years [3] . In this letter we consider five-dimensional supergravities [4] where the extra dimension is compactified on a circle [5] or orbifold [6] . These are known as Randall-Sundrum type I [7] and type II [8] scenarios respectively. They allow for localization of Standard Model particles [9] and their excitations [10] on the so-called visible brane while gravitons propagate freely through the bulk [11] . As a consequence they may solve some problems associated with the hierarchy between the electroweak scale and the Planck scale [12] . Moreover, such models offer interesting possibilities for constructing regular black-hole-like objects [13] - [16] .",1,0
"We study the evolution of an open universe with negative spatial curvature and a scalar field that is minimally coupled to gravity but has a positive kinetic energy density, known as a phantom field.We find that this model can be mapped onto a closed universe filled with ordinary matter and radiation by means of a coordinate transformation which preserves the form of Einstein's equations.This mapping allows us to use results obtained for standard Friedmann-Robertson-Walker models to calculate the time dependence of the scale factor and Hubble parameter during the entire history of our universe.In particular we show how the present value of the dark energy density parameter Ω_Λ may be determined from measurements of the cosmic microwave background temperature anisotropy spectrum at large angular scales (low multipoles).The resulting values are consistent with those inferred from observations of type Ia supernovae and large-scale structure formation. We also discuss some possible observational tests of these predictions.",1,0
"We have performed ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to study the in-plane structure, order parameters, and surface tension of liquid Na(l) in contact with vacuum or solid NaCl (001). We find that the density profile is strongly dependent on the presence of an underlying substrate; it exhibits a pronounced double peak for the case without substrate but becomes single-peaked when the substrate is present. The height fluctuations are found to be larger than those observed experimentally by STM measurements. This discrepancy may arise due to the fact that our simulation cell contains only one layer of liquid sodium atoms while experiments typically involve several layers. In addition, we observe that the average nearest neighbor distance decreases as the number of layers increases. Our results show that the in-plane structure of liquid sodium can be significantly influenced by its environment. Finally, we calculate the surface tensions using two different methods and compare them against each other.",1,0
"We present an analytical theory for describing capillary forces between two spherical particles in contact with each other and immersed into a liquid, which is valid even when the separation distance between them becomes comparable to their size. The theory takes into account both the effect of surface tension on the shape of menisci formed around the particles as well as the effect of gravity. We show that these effects lead to new types of attractive and repulsive capillary forces acting between the particles at small separations. In particular, we find that the gravitational force can induce a net attraction between the particles even if they are completely wetted by the liquid phase (i.e., have no dry patches). This prediction agrees very well with our numerical results obtained using Surface Evolver software package. Our theoretical predictions are also confirmed by experiments performed with polystyrene microspheres suspended in water. Capillary forces play important role in many physical phenomena such as adhesion [1] , sedimentation [2] , flotation [3] , etc.. However, despite numerous experimental studies [4] - [8] there still remains significant uncertainty about how exactly these forces depend on various parameters characterizing the system under consideration [9] . One of the main reasons behind this situation is that existing theories [10] - [12] developed within the framework of classical continuum mechanics cannot be applied directly to describe capillary interactions occurring at distances smaller than the characteristic length scale associated with the curvature of interfaces separating different phases [13] . In order to overcome this difficulty one usually resorts to some approximate approaches based either on the concept of effective Hamaker constants [14] or on the so-called 'superposition approximation' [15] . These methods allow one to obtain simple expressions for the total interaction energy but do not provide any information about its dependence on the detailed geometry of the problem [16] . Moreover, it has been shown recently [17] that the latter approach fails...",1,0
"The effect of intermolecular interactions on the elastic properties of bottlebrush polymer networks is investigated using molecular dynamics simulations and experimental measurements. The results show that the network becomes softer with increasing density, which can be explained in terms of an increase in the number of entanglements between neighboring chains. This softening behavior is also observed experimentally for bottlebrush polyurethane networks prepared at different densities. It is found that the simulated stress-strain curves are well described by the Gent model, where the effective spring constant decreases as the density increases. These findings suggest that the mechanical properties of bottlebrush polymer gels can be tuned by changing their density.Soft materials such as rubbers have been widely used in many applications including tires, seals, adhesives, and biomaterials because they exhibit unique physical characteristics such as high extensibility and low modulus [1–3]. In particular, bottlebrush polymers consisting of densely grafted side chains have attracted considerable attention due to their outstanding mechanical properties [4–6]. For example, it has recently been reported that bottlebrush poly(ether urethane)s (PEUs), synthesized via ring-opening metathesis polymerization [7, 8], possess higher tensile strength than conventional PEU elastomers [9]. However, despite these advantages, there remain some challenges associated with the use of bottlebrush polymers in practical applications. One of them is how to control the mechanical properties of bottle brushes since the macroscopic properties depend strongly on the microstructure [10, 11]. Therefore, understanding the relationship between structure and property is important for designing new types of bottlebrush-based materials.In this study, we investigate the influence of chain density on the mechanical properties of bottle-brush polyurethanes (BPUs). We find that BPUs become softer when the density increases. To understand this phenomenon, we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on coarse-grained models [12]. Our simulation results reveal that the network becomes sof...",1,0
"We report on X-ray timing observations of the pulsar candidate PSR J1930+1855 located at the center of the supernova remnant (SNR) G54.1+0.The source was discovered by Chandra and confirmed as a pulsar with XMM-Newton, but its spin period is not stable over time scales longer than one day. We performed two sets of pointed RXTE observations to study this behavior further. In both cases we found that the pulse frequency decreases smoothly during our observation runs. This trend can be described well using an exponential decay model for which we find characteristic timescales of 1.1 days and 0.7 days respectively. These values are consistent with those reported previously based on Chandra data alone. However, when comparing these results directly it should be noted that the uncertainties associated with the previous measurements were significantly larger due to the lower signal-to-noise ratio achieved with Chandra compared to RXTE.",1,0
"We present results on collisions between two identical spherical grains with radii ranging from 0.1 to 1 mm and velocities up to 10 m/s, which are relevant for the growth of planetesimals in protoplanetary disks. We find that the collision outcome depends strongly on the impact velocity. At low velocities (<5 m/s), the colliding particles stick together after the first contact without any fragmentation or erosion. For higher velocities we observe bouncing, sticking, partial fragmentation, and complete fragmentation depending on the impact angle. The transition between different outcomes is smooth but can be described by simple scaling laws. In particular, we show that the critical velocity at which the transition from sticking to bouncing occurs scales as vcrit ∝ R0.6 where R is the radius of one particle. This dependence agrees well with recent experiments performed under microgravity conditions. Finally, we discuss how these findings affect our understanding of dust coagulation in protoplanetary discs.",1,0
"We study the effect of competing short-range attractive and repulsive interactions in a model for collapsed polymers, which are described by an effective one-dimensional potential with two minima separated by a barrier. We show that this system exhibits a rich phase diagram as function of temperature T , interaction strength U0 and asymmetry parameter . The main results are: (i) For small values of we find three different phases: a low-temperature disordered phase, a high-temperature ordered phase and a critical point separating them. (ii) In the limit of large barriers between the wells, i.e., when becomes very large or T decreases to zero, the transition line approaches the value Uc = 2U0/3 predicted by mean-field theory.IntroductionCollapsed polymers have been studied extensively over many years [1]-[6]. They can be found in biological systems such as proteins [7][8][9], but also occur in synthetic materials like micelles [10]-[12]. A common feature of these systems is their ability to form compact structures due to strong shortrange attractions combined with longer-ranged repulsions. This leads to a double-well type of potential energy landscape [13][14][15], where particles tend to aggregate into clusters [16]. These aggregates may undergo structural changes [17], resulting in transitions between different states [18]. Such phenomena are often observed experimentally [19][20][21] [22]. However, despite extensive research efforts there still remain open questions about the nature of the underlying mechanisms leading to these complex behaviors [23].",1,0
"The Astrodynamics Space Test of Relativity using Optical Devices (ASTROD) mission is proposed as an experiment for testing the gravitational theory in space, and it will be launched into orbit around L2 point by 2020.The ASTROD satellite system consists of two satellites with four free-floating test masses each. In this study we simulated the charging process of these test masses caused by solar energetic particles during their lifetime in space. We used the SPENVIS software package developed at the European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC). Our results show that the maximum charge accumulated on one of the test masses can reach up to 1.5 nC after 10 years' exposure time. This value is much higher than the expected measurement uncertainty of 0.1 nC. Therefore, it should be taken into account when designing the electrostatic control systems of the ASTROD satellites.

"We investigate the evolution of an eruptive coronal mass ejection (CME) by using three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations, which include both ideal MHD effects and resistivity. The initial condition is constructed as follows. First we solve the Grad-Shafranov equation for force-free equilibrium to obtain the distribution of poloidal current density on the surface of a torus-like structure. Then we construct a 3D model of the torus-like structure by assuming that it has uniform temperature T = 1 MK and pressure P = 0.1 dyn cm-2 inside its volume. We also assume that there are two types of plasma flows along the field lines; one is slow solar wind flowing out from the bottom boundary at r = 2 R_sun , where Rsun denotes the radius of the Sun, and another is fast solar wind flowing into the top boundary at r = 20 Rsun . Finally, we add random fluctuations to the velocity fields so that they have kinetic energy comparable to their thermal energies.In our simulation runs, we find three different phases during the CME evolution. During phase I, the magnetic flux rope rises slowly due to the Lorentz force associated with the toroidal component of the magnetic field. At t50 min., when the height reaches about 5 RSUN , the rising motion suddenly accelerates because of the rapid expansion of the flux rope's cross section caused by magnetic reconnection between open field lines and closed loops around the flux rope. This acceleration continues until the flux rope reaches the upper boundary at t80 min. .During phase II, the flux rope expands rapidly outward while maintaining its shape. After reaching the maximum size at t90 min. , however, the flux rope starts contracting inward again. As a result, the flux rope becomes thinner than before but still maintains its twisted structure. Meanwhile, the surrounding open field lines become more bent toward each other near the center of the flux rope. These results suggest that the flux rope undergoes a kink instability after expanding outward beyond its critical size.",1,0
"We propose a new string derived model with stable proton in which the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is not neutralino but gravitino. The LSP decays into photon or neutrino-antineutrino pair through gravitational interaction. In this scenario we can explain the observed dark matter abundance without conflicting with other experimental results such as relic density measurement by WMAP experiment. We also show that our model predicts interesting signatures at LHC experiments. Introduction:-The discovery of Higgs boson [1-3] has opened up an exciting possibility to explore physics beyond Standard Model(SM). Supersymmetry(SUSY), one of the most promising extensions of SM [4] , provides natural solution for hierarchy problem [5] . However, SUSY models are severely constrained by various experimental observations [6] . In order to solve these problems, several authors have proposed different mechanisms [7-9]. One of them is introducing additional gauge symmetries [10] . Another way is adding extra dimensions [11] . Recently, it was shown that there exists a class of string derived models where the lightest superpartner is gravitino [12] . Gravitino is weakly interacting massive particle so its decay rate is suppressed compared to neutralino case [13] . This feature makes gravitino a good candidate for cold dark matter [14] . Moreover, if gravitino mass m 3/2 < 1 GeV then its lifetime becomes longer than age of universe [15] . Therefore, gravitino may be regarded as a viable candidate for dark matter [16] . On the other hand, gravitino is unstable because it couples to gravity [17] . It decays into photon or lepton-neutrino pairs [18] . If gravitino is heavier than 100 MeV then its decay products will contribute to diffuse gamma ray background [19] . Thus, gravitino should satisfy following conditions [20] :",1,0
"We revisit the slow relaxation in a model glass-forming system, namely a binary mixture of Lennard-Jones particles interacting via a Weeks-Chandler-Andersen potential with an additional repulsive shoulder at short distances. The main goal is to investigate whether this simple model can reproduce some of the features observed experimentally for silicate melts and glasses such as the stretched exponential decay of the intermediate scattering function or the presence of two distinct time scales in the structural relaxation process. To that end we perform molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) computer simulations on systems containing up to N = 1000 particles. In particular, by means of MC simulations we are able to study much larger systems than those accessible through MD runs. Our results show that both methods give rise to similar relaxation patterns but there exist subtle differences between them which may be relevant when comparing theory and experiment. Finally, we discuss how our findings compare with previous theoretical predictions based on mode-coupling theories.",1,0
"We present the Hamiltonian formulation for general relativity with matter fields on an arbitrary spacetime manifold, including both classical and quantum aspects. The basic idea is to use the ADM decomposition of the metric into space and time components as well as lapse and shift functions. We then introduce canonical momenta conjugate to these variables which are used to construct the primary constraints of the theory. These constraints generate gauge transformations under which all physical quantities must be invariant. In order to obtain the correct number of degrees of freedom we have to impose secondary constraints that eliminate unphysical modes. Finally, we perform the canonical quantization by promoting the phase-space variables to operators acting on wave-functions defined over superspace (the space of all possible metrics). This leads us to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation whose solutions can be interpreted as probability amplitudes between different states of the universe. We also discuss how this approach could be applied to inflationary models.",1,0
"We propose an extension of the linear mixed model that allows researchers to control for unobserved individual heterogeneity when estimating treatment effects using panel data. We show how this approach can be used to estimate the effect of school choice on test scores and college enrollment decisions while controlling for selection bias due to unobserved differences between students who choose different schools. Our results suggest that school choice has no significant impact on either test scores or college enrollment rates once we account for unobserved individual characteristics.Keywords: Panel Data, Mixed Models, Treatment Effects, School Choice1 IntroductionIn recent years there have been numerous studies examining the relationship between school choice policies and student outcomes (see Hanushek et al., 2007 , for a review). Most of these studies use cross-sectional data to compare average performance across groups of students attending public versus private schools. However, it is well known that such comparisons are subject to endogeneity problems because they do not take into account the fact that students self-select into different types of schools based on their observed and unobserved characteristics (HoxbyWeingarth, 2005) . This problem may lead to biased estimates if the factors driving students' choices also affect their academic performance.2 The ModelIn order to address this issue, several authors have proposed alternative estimation strategies aimed at correcting for sample selectivity by explicitly modeling the process through which individuals make educational choices (e.g., Heckman, 1979; Lee, 1997; Wooldridge, 2002 ) . These approaches typically rely on parametric assumptions about the distribution of the error terms associated with both the outcome equation and the selection equation. For example, one popular method consists of jointly estimating two equations -one describing the probability that each individual chooses a particular type of school,...",1,0

"We prove that for any surface S of general type, the action of its absolute Galois group G(S) on the set of connected components of the modulis space M_g(S) is faithful.This result has been conjectured by Grothendieck and proved in many cases (e.g., when g = 0 or 1).We use this to show that if S admits an automorphism of order p > 2 then it also admits one of order q prime to p; we give examples where both orders are arbitrarily large. The proof relies on results about the existence of certain families of curves on S which have been obtained recently using techniques from algebraic geometry and number theory. In particular, we make essential use of the fact that the canonical map of such a curve C onto P^1 is birational; this implies that the image of C under the Albanese map Alb_S : S -> Alb_S(S) is not contained in a fiber of Alb_S.",1,0
"The collective properties of odd-mass nuclei are investigated in terms of the interacting vector boson model (IVBM). The IVBM is based on an effective Lagrangian density that describes the coupling between nucleons and mesons, including the rho-meson field as well as the omega-meson fields with their respective neutral currents. In this work we have used the extended version of the IVBM which includes also the delta-resonance degrees of freedom. We have calculated the energy levels for some selected even-even nuclei along with those corresponding to the first excited state of neighboring odd-A nuclei using the same set of parameters. It has been found that the inclusion of the delta resonance leads to better agreement with experimental data than without it. This fact indicates that the role played by the delta resonance should not be neglected when studying nuclear structure phenomena such as pairing correlations or shape coexistence. Finally, we have studied the effect of the spin-orbit interaction on the ground-state band built upon the lowest 0+ state.",1,0
"The electronic structure and magnetic properties of heme are investigated by density functional theory (DFT) with the Hubbard U correction for strong electron correlation effects, which is essential to reproduce the correct ground state spin multiplicity in this system. The calculated results show that the ferromagnetic coupling between iron ions leads to an antiferromagnetically ordered ground state when the axial ligands are included. In addition, we find that the inclusion of the solvent effect on the geometry optimization does not change the energy difference significantly but it can affect the relative stability among different spin states. Finally, our calculations suggest that the high-spin state may be more stable than previously thought based on experimental measurements. This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 11404160. We thank Prof. Yi-Kai Wu at Peking University for helpful discussions.IntroductionHeme is one of the most important cofactors found in many proteins involved in biological processes such as oxygen transport, storage, sensing, and catalysis1-5. It consists of a porphyrin ring coordinated to Fe(II), where four nitrogen atoms form two pyrrole rings connected through methine bridges6-8. Due to its importance in biology, there have been numerous theoretical studies investigating the structural9-12, optical13-15, vibrational16-19, and magnetic20-24 properties of heme.

The corresponding Feynman rules are derived using the method developed in Ref. [1] . In particular we find that there exists no contribution from the axial vector current at tree level. This result agrees with the prediction based on chiral symmetry arguments [2] , but disagrees with previous calculations [3, 4] . The results presented here were obtained during my stay as a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University supported by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation. I would like to thank Prof. M. J. Duffy for his hospitality. Introduction -In recent years much attention has been paid to the investigation of processes involving photons in connection with their possible role in physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). One such process is the decay Z_0→2 γ, where the neutral gauge boson Z_0 decays into a photon-antiphoton pair. It was first studied within the SM framework [3] , and later also considered in various extensions [4] . Recently it attracted renewed interest due to its potential relevance for Higgs searches [5] . However, since the experimental signature of this process is very similar to that of the background [6] , it will probably not be observable before LHC starts operating [7, 8] . Nevertheless, it still provides valuable information about the underlying theory [9] . For example, if the Higgs particle turns out to have spin zero or one [10] , then the decay Z_0→2γcould provide important constraints on the couplings between the Higgs field and other particles [11] . Furthermore, the measurement of the branching ratio BR(Z_0→2γ) allows us to determine the fine structure constant [12] . Finally, the decay Z_0→ν̅ e e + e - followed by the subsequent decay of the electron-positron pair into a photon-antiphoton pair",1,0
"We study how the effects of galactic winds can be used to explain the observed properties of the metal-poor tail in the stellar metallicity distributions (SMDs) of nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSph). We find that SMD is sensitive to both the mass loss rate and wind velocity, but not very sensitive to other parameters such as the initial mass function or star formation history. The best-fit model for each galaxy has been obtained by comparing its SMD with those predicted using different sets of free parameters. Our results show that all these dSph have experienced strong outflows driven by supernovae explosions during their early evolution stages. These outflows are responsible for removing most metals produced by stars formed before z = 1.5-2.0. In addition, we also found that some of them may experience additional late-time outflow events which could remove more metals produced after this time period.",1,0
"The gamma ray emission in the energy range 100 MeV to 10 GeV is studied using data taken by EGRET on board CGRO during its first four years of operation (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) . The analysis has been performed for two different regions, one centered at l = 0° and b = - 5° , which includes the galactic centre region, and another centered at l = 180° and b = + 5° . In both cases we have used an iterative maximum likelihood method to determine the fluxes of individual sources as well as their spectral parameters.We find that there are three distinct components contributing to the observed gamma-ray flux above 1 GeV :A diffuse component with a power law spectrum extending upto10 GeV . A point source located near Sgr A* with a power law spectrum . An extended source towards the galactic center with a broken power law spectrum .We also present results obtained when the same analysis was repeated after excluding the contribution due to the central part of the Galaxy .",1,0
"We study the unitarity properties of an effective field theory describing the interactions between gluons and quarks in QCD at high energies, where perturbation theory is not applicable anymore. The model we consider consists of a gauge-invariant action containing both massive and massless fields. We show that this model can be written as a sum over Feynman diagrams which are all unitary individually if certain conditions on the parameters appearing in the Lagrangian density are satisfied. In particular, it turns out that the masses of the particles involved must satisfy some relations to ensure unitarity. Finally, we discuss how these results could be used for phenomenological applications. PACS numbers: 11.10.Wx, 12.38.Qk, 13 .60.HbI. INTRODUCTORY REMAR K S The Standard Model (SM) describes successfully most experimental data available today [1] , but its validity has been tested only up to energies of about 1 TeV [2] . At higher energies new phenomena may appear beyond those predicted by the SM [3] . In order to describe such effects one usually considers extensions of the SM [4] or models based on effective theories [5] . Effective theories provide a systematic way to include corrections due to physics at scales above the energy scale considered [6] . They allow us to calculate observables using perturbative techniques even when the underlying dynamics cannot be described within the framework of standard quantum mechanics [7, 8] . This approach is particularly useful in cases where there exists no fundamental description of the physical system under consideration [9] . One example of an effective theory is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of strong interactions [10] . It predicts the existence of hadrons made of quarks and gluons [11] . However, since the typical momentum transfer inside a hadron is much smaller than the characteristic scale of QCD processes [12] , the latter can be studied separately from the former [13] . For instance, the production of jets [14] and heavy flavors [15] in high-energy collisions can be calculated using perturbative methods [16] . On the other hand, the interaction among partons [17]",1,0
"The Kuiper belt is the source region for most short period comets, but its formation remains poorly understood. We present results from N-body simulations that show how collisions among planetesimals in Neptune's feeding zone can produce objects with orbits similar to those observed today. The initial conditions are based on models of planet migration during which Neptune migrated outward by about 30 AU before being halted at its current location. Our calculations suggest that the Kuiper belt formed as a result of collisional grinding between bodies whose sizes were comparable to Pluto (r1000 km). This process produced a population of small bodies with orbital eccentricities ranging up to 0.3. Subsequent encounters with Neptune caused some of these bodies to be scattered into highly eccentric orbits. These results provide an explanation for why there appears to be no correlation between the size distribution of KBOs and their orbital eccentricity.",1,0
"The inter-hourly-variability index is proposed to measure geomagnetic activity on hourly basis, which can be used as an indicator for solar wind speed variation over time scales longer than one day.The IHV index was calculated using hourly values of Kp index during the period 1957-2009. It shows that there are two peaks at about 1965-1970 and 1990-1995 . A linear regression analysis between the IHV index and solar wind speed data obtained by spacecraft observations reveals that they have good correlation with each other. This suggests that the IHV index may provide useful information for long-term prediction of solar wind speed. Keywords: Geomagnetism; Solar wind; Variability index; Prediction modeling; Data mining. 1 Introduction Space weather has been attracting more attention recently because it affects many aspects of human life such as satellite communications, aviation safety, power grids etc. (e.g., [1] ). In particular, solar wind plays important roles in space weather since it carries away magnetic fluxes generated by the Sun's dynamo action [2] , and thus controls the Earth's magnetosphere [3] . Solar wind is driven out from the Sun by coronal mass ejections [4] . Coronal mass ejections occur when huge amounts of plasma suddenly escape from the Sun into space [5] . They usually last several hours [6] . Therefore, solar wind speed varies significantly within 24 h [7, 8] . However, most previous studies only focus on the average solar wind speed or daily averaged solar wind speed [9] . As a result, little work has been done on investigating how solar wind speed changes on shorter timescales [10] .",1,0
"We present integral field spectroscopy (IFS) observations of the extended emission-line region (EELR)We use these data to study the kinematics and excitation conditions in this EELR, which is foundThe IFS data reveal that the gas has an average velocity dispersion of200 km s-1 across most of theWe find evidence for two distinct components within the EELR: one component with low-excitationproperties similar to those observed in other radio galaxies; and another component with higher-excitation properties than are typically seen in radio galaxies.The high-excitation component appears to be associated with shocks driven by the radio jets into the surrounding medium. In addition, we detect several compact knots of [O III] emission along the northern edge of the EELR, which may represent sites where new stars have formed as a result of jet-induced star formation or galaxy mergers.",1,0
"We present highly resolved numerical simulations of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with the LANS-alpha model, which is known to produce good results for wall-bounded flows at low Reynolds numbers. We show that this method can also be used in high-Reynolds number situations where it produces accurate results even though its underlying assumptions are not valid anymore. The main advantage over standard LES methods lies in the fact that no explicit subgrid-scale models have to be introduced. This makes the approach very attractive since there is no need to tune any parameters or coefficients as required by other LES approaches. In addition we demonstrate how the LANS-alpha method can be combined with an implicit LES scheme based on the variational multiscale formulation (VMS-LES) to obtain more efficient computations. Finally, we discuss some open issues related to the use of these schemes in practical applications. Turbulence plays a crucial role in many physical phenomena ranging from weather prediction to oceanic circulation and combustion processes. However, despite decades of research turbulence still remains one of the most challenging problems in computational fluid dynamics. One reason for this difficulty is due to the wide range of length scales involved in turbulent flows. While large eddies contain most of the kinetic energy they only occupy a small fraction of the total volume. On the other hand smaller eddies fill up almost all space but contribute little to the overall kinetic energy. Therefore, if one wants to resolve all relevant flow structures accurately enough then extremely fine grids would be needed leading to prohibitively expensive calculations. To overcome this problem so-called Large Eddy Simulations (LESs) were developed during the last two decades [1, 2] . These techniques aim at resolving only those large-scale motions responsible for the bulk of the kinetic energy while modeling the effect of unresolved small-scale fluctuations using suitable closure relations. Although LES has been successfully applied to various engineering problems [3–5] , it suffers from several drawbacks such as the lack of universality of the employed sub-grid scale models [6] . In recent years new classes of LES-like methods have emerged [7–10] . They are based",1,0
"We present new measurements of 3 He+ and 3 He++ column densities toward eight nearby stars, using data obtained with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE). The results are compared to previous observations made by Copernicus and IUE satellites as well as FUSE. We find that our values for N(3 He+)/N(H+), which range between 0.0015-0.0125, agree within uncertainties with those measured previously at high latitudes but disagree significantly with lower latitude measurements. Our results suggest that there is an additional source of ionization near the Galactic plane not accounted for by cosmic rays or X-rays. This could be due to shocks driven into the interstellar medium by supernovae remnants and/or winds associated with massive OB associations.Keywords: Helium abundance, Interstellar medium, Shocks, Supernova remnant, Winds, Cosmic ray",1,0
"We perform global three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations to study grain growth, dust settling, and planetesimal formation around protoplanets embedded within turbulent disks with dead zone boundaries. We find that grains grow by coagulation up to millimeter sizes at the snow line (R_s = 2.7 ∗ d_s AU), where R_s is the distance between the central star and the snowline, ds is the disk scale height, and AU denotes astronomical unit. Grains are trapped inside the dead zone due to magnetic pressure gradient force and settle toward midplane. The maximum size of grains increases as they approach the planet's location because of higher gas density there. Dust particles can be captured into growing planetesimals when their Stokes number becomes smaller than unity. Our results show that planetesimals form efficiently only if the initial dust-to-gas mass ratio is larger than 10^-3.",1,0
"The problem of finding the energy levels of an electron bound to a nucleus is one of the most important problems in physics, which has been studied for many years. In this article we consider the case where there are two electrons with opposite spins that can occupy different orbitals around the same nucleus. We show how to compute these states using only polynomial time computations on classical computers. This result was obtained by applying some techniques developed recently in computational complexity theory such as the PCP theorem (the probabilistic checkable proof) and the local testability of CSPs (constraint satisfaction problems). The results presented here have applications not only in theoretical physics but also in computer science. For example they provide new insights into the structure of NP-complete problems. Quantum mechanical systems play an essential role in modern physics. One of their main features is that particles may be found in superposition of several states at once. A famous example is Schrödinger's cat experiment [1] . Another feature is entanglement [2] , i.e., correlations between particles that cannot be explained classically [3] . In this work we study the following problem: given a system consisting of N spin-1/2 particles, what is the ground state? That means, if all particles were measured simultaneously, what would be the probability distribution over the possible outcomes? We will focus our attention on the simplest non-trivial case: two spin-½ particles occupying different orbitals around the nucleus [4] . It turns out that it is sufficient to solve this problem in order to find the ground state of any number of particles [5] .",1,0
"We show that the Pioneer anomaly, which is an anomalous acceleration observed in radio tracking data for two spacecrafts launched by NASA (Pioneer 10/11), can be explained if we assume that there exists a conformal symmetry breaking effect at large distances from our solar system. We also argue that this effect may lead to accelerating expansion of the universe. The idea behind these results is based on the fact that the space-time metric around massive bodies has been shown to have a certain degree of anisotropy due to quantum gravity effects. This anisotropic nature of space-time leads to violation of Lorentz invariance, which in turn causes violations of energy-momentum conservation laws. In order to explain such violations within the framework of general relativity one needs to introduce new fields into the theory. These are called 'dark fields' because they do not interact with ordinary matter but only affect gravitational interactions between particles.",1,0
"We study the nonlinear dynamics of infectious diseases transfer in a population, where individuals are divided into three classes: susceptible (S), infected (I) and recovered/removed (R). We consider two different models: SIR model and SEIR model. In both cases we assume that there is no birth or death in the population. The main goal of this work is to investigate how the disease spreads through the population depending on its parameters. For example, if the infection rate is too high then it may lead to an epidemic outbreak. On the other hand, if the recovery rate is very large compared to the infection rate then the number of infectives will decrease rapidly. Finally, we show some numerical simulations which illustrate our results.Keywords: Nonlinear dynamics, infectious diseases, tuberculosis, SIR model, SEIR model. 1 IntroductionMany mathematical models have been developed over time to describe the spread of infectious diseases within populations [1–3] . These models can be used as tools to understand the transmission mechanisms of these diseases and help public health authorities make decisions about prevention strategies [4] .In particular, many researchers have studied the effects of vaccination programs [5–7] , quarantine [8, 9] and isolation [10, 11] on the evolution of epidemics. Other studies focus on the impact of environmental factors such as temperature [12, 13] , humidity [14, 15] and rainfall [16] on the propagation of pathogens.The majority of existing works use deterministic models based on ordinary differential equations [17] . However, stochastic models [18, 19] and agent-based models [20, 21] also exist. Agent-based models allow us to take into account individual behaviors [22] while stochastic models provide more realistic descriptions of random events [23] .In this article, we propose new mathematical models describing the spread of infectious diseases in a closed population. Our aim is to analyze the influence of various parameters on the behavior of the system. More specifically, we want to determine whether the disease will die out naturally or cause an epidemic outbreak. To do so, we first introduce the basic reproduction number R0 [24] , which represents the average number",1,0
"We present new simulations that show how condensed gas is formed by ongoing accretion onto galactic halos, which are heated to temperatures above 10 million degrees Kelvin (MK). The condensed gas forms as the hot halo cools radiatively on timescales shorter than its dynamical time. We compare these results with observations of cool clouds in nearby galaxy clusters. Our models predict that condensed gas should be found at distances between 100 kpc and 1 Mpc from galaxies within massive clusters. This prediction agrees well with recent X-ray observations of cool clouds in Abell 1795 and Abell 2163. These clouds have masses ranging from 10^9 to 10^11 solar masses, sizes less than 50 kiloparsecs, and densities greater than 1000 atoms per cubic centimeter. They also appear to be moving outward relative to their host galaxies at velocities up to several hundred kilometers per second. In addition, we find that our model predicts cloud lifetimes longer than one billion years for most observed clouds.",1,0

We have observed more than 1000 targets in the open cluster M67 during three nights using the HARPS spectrograph at La Silla Observatory. Our observations show that we can reach precisions better than 1 m/s over periods of one hour.

"We propose an encoding scheme for layered associative network (LAN) of spiking neurons, which is based on sparse coding and dense coding. The proposed method can be used to learn the association between input patterns and output patterns by using unsupervised learning algorithms such as Hebbian learning rule or spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). We show that our model has better performance than conventional LANs with respect to both storage capacity and retrieval accuracy. In addition, we demonstrate that our model can perform pattern completion task without any additional training data.Index Terms-Layered associaton network, Sparse coding, Dense coding, Pattern completion, STDP, Unsupervised learning algorithm. 1 Introduction Recently, there have been many studies about artificial neural networks [1] . Among them, layered associative network (L AN ) [2] , which consists of multiple layers of neurons connected through synapses, has attracted much attention because it shows high storage capacity and good retrieval accuracy [3] . In L AN s, each neuron receives inputs from all neurons in previous layer via synaptic connections. Then, the activity level of each neuron is determined by its firing rate according to the following equation:where x i denotes the activity level of ith neuron at time t, w ij represents connection weight from jth neuron in previous layer to ith neuron in current layer, f(·) stands for activation function, and b i indicates bias term [4] . Since the number of possible combinations of activities among neurons increases exponentially when the number of neurons becomes large, storing information in L AN requires huge amount of memory space [5] . To overcome this problem, several approaches have been suggested [6] - [8] . For example, sparseness constraint was introduced into L AN so that only small fraction of neurons are active simultaneously [9] . However, these methods require supervised learning algorithms to train parameters of L AN , which makes their applications limited [10] .",1,0
"We study the vulnerability of interdependent networks under cascading failures, where nodes are subject to random attacks and their neighbors can fail as well due to loss of connectivity. We show that dynamic effects increase network vulnerability by enhancing the spreading of failures in time. In particular, we find that increasing the number of attackers or decreasing the recovery rate increases the probability for global cascade failure. Our results suggest that it is important to consider both static and dynamic aspects when studying the robustness of real-world systems against cascading failures. Interdependence between different components of complex systems has been shown to be crucial for understanding many phenomena such as epidemic outbreaks [1] , traffic jams [2] , financial crashes [3] , and blackouts [4] . The recent 2008 power grid crisis caused by an unprecedented series of cascading failures [5] highlighted the importance of considering interdependence among system elements [6] . In this work, we focus on interdependent networks [7, 8] , which consist of two types of nodes: source (S) and target (T). Source nodes provide services to other nodes while target nodes depend on these services. For example, in the case of the power grid, generators supply electricity to substations; if one generator fails then its neighboring substations will also lose power [9] . Similarly, in social networks people may rely on each other's opinions [10] ; if someone becomes ill [11] or loses her job [12] she might affect others' health status [13] or income [14] respectively. Recent studies have shown that interdependency plays an important role in determining the resilience of interconnected systems [15, 16] . However, most previous works focused only on static properties [17] , i.e., they assumed that all links remain stable over time [18] . This assumption does not hold true in practice since links often break down [19] and new ones form [20] . Therefore, it is necessary to take into account the dynamics of interactions [21] .",1,0
"We present new observations made with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) of two inter-network sunspots in active region NOAA AR 12192 on 2013 May 24 and 25, respectively. The first sunspot was observed for about 3 hours during which time it rotated by more than 90 degrees. We find that this sunspot is composed of several magnetic flux tubes with different orientations. In addition to these features we also observe an extended bright feature located between the main sunspot umbrae. This feature has been previously reported as a penumbral filament but our data show no evidence of such structure. Instead, we interpret this feature as a coronal rain blob. The second sunspot was observed for only 1 hour before being occulted by Earths atmosphere. During this observation period the sunspot rotated by less than 30 degrees. Our analysis shows that both sunspots are surrounded by a dark lane which may be associated with the moat surrounding large sunspots.",1,0
"Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are promising materials for field emission devices due to their unique physical and chemical properties, such as high aspect ratio, low work function, and excellent mechanical strength.In this study, we present an integrated multiphysics model that can be used to simulate the system response of CNT-based field emitting diodes (FEDs). The proposed model consists of three sub-models: 1) electron transport in CNT; 2) electrostatic potential distribution; 3) current density distribution. We have developed these models using COMSOL Multiphysics software package with built-in physics modules. To verify our simulation results, we fabricated a CNT-FED device by growing vertically aligned CNTs onto silicon substrate via plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition method followed by sputtering gold film over them. Our experimental data show good agreement with simulated results obtained from the proposed model.",1,0
"We present an analysis of the evolution of interstellar dust grains, based on their size distribution inferred by infrared observations with ISO (Infrared Space Observatory). We find that the grain growth is dominated by coagulation at all times since the formation of the Sun. The total mass density of dust increases by about one order of magnitude during this time span. This increase can be explained by accretion of gas-phase metals onto pre-existing grains or condensation of new material out of the gas phase. In addition to these processes we also consider fragmentation as well as shattering due to collisions between particles. Fragmentation dominates over coagulation for small grains but becomes less important when the grains grow larger than 0.1 micrometres. For large grains shattering leads to a decrease in number density which counteracts the effect of coagulation. Our results are consistent with previous studies using different methods.Keywords: Interstellar medium",1,0
"We report on the observation of super-Poissonian shot noise in closed quantum dots (QDs). We show that this effect is due to dephasing and can be used for its characterization. The QD emission linewidth was measured by scanning Fabry-Perot interferometry, while the photon statistics were studied using Hanbury Brown-Twiss experiments with two avalanche photodiodes operating at 1 GHz bandwidth. In order to study the influence of temperature we performed these measurements between 4 K and 300 K. At low temperatures, below 50 K, the QD emission linewidth decreases exponentially with decreasing temperature following an activation energy of about 0.3 meV. Above 100 K it follows a power law dependence with T-1/2. Super-Poissonian shot-noise appears above 60 K and increases rapidly up to room temperature where it reaches values more than twice those expected for Poissonian light.",1,0
"We present an algorithm for searching in databases that are stored as qubits, which is the basic unit of information in quantum computers. The search problem can be formulated by using Grover's algorithm and its variants to find one or more solutions among many possibilities. We show how this approach can be used to solve problems such as finding a particular molecule within a large chemical compound library. Our results demonstrate that it may be possible to use quantum algorithms to accelerate searches on future quantum computer hardware. Quantum computing has been proposed as a new paradigm for solving computational problems with applications ranging from chemistry to optimization theory [1-3]. In contrast to classical computers, where data is represented by bits (0s or 1s), quantum computers store information in qubits, which can take any superposition of 0s and 1s [4] . This feature allows quantum computers to perform certain computations exponentially faster than their classical counterparts [5] . In order to make practical use of these advantages, however, we need efficient ways to implement quantum algorithms [6] , including those based on Grover's algorithm [7-9]. Here, we propose a method for identifying unambiguously a single solution out of multiple possibilities [10] . As an example application, our technique could be used to identify a specific molecule within a larger chemical compound library [11] .",1,0

Fourteen of them are found to orbit stars more massive than 0.5 M⊙ , while two others are around low-mass dwarfs. These planets are located between 0.1 AU and 4 AU away from their host stars.

"The reaction mechanism for the ring-opening reactions of cyclic alkanes with water has been studied using density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio molecular orbital methods at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p), MP2/6-31+G*, QCISD/6-31+G* levels in conjunction with the CBS-QB3 method to calculate enthalpies of formation.The results show that the activation energies are lower than those obtained previously by DFT or semiempirical methods. In addition, it is found that the transition states have one imaginary frequency along the reaction coordinate corresponding to the breaking of C-H bonds on both sides of the carbonyl group. The calculated rate constants agree well with experimental data over a wide temperature range. Finally, we propose an explanation for the observed differences between theoretical predictions and experiments based on the fact that the solvent effect was not taken into account in previous studies.",1,0
"We report the observation of magnetic fluctuations at low temperatures and high fields in single crystals of YBa2Cu3O6+x (YBCO) with x=0.4, 0.45, and 0.5 using muon spin relaxation measurements. The data show that these materials are characterized by an unusual temperature dependence of the fluctuation rate which is not consistent with predictions based on Fermi liquid theory or any other conventional model for fermionic quasiparticles. We argue that this behavior can be understood within a phenomenological description of the electronic excitations as bosonic collective modes. These results provide strong evidence against the existence of well-defined fermionic quasiparticles in the normal state of these compounds. They also suggest that the pseudogap phase may have some features in common with the superfluid state.High-temperature cuprate superconductors exhibit many remarkable properties including a rich variety of competing ground states. In particular, it has been suggested that they undergo a quantum phase transition into a novel ordered state known as the 'pseudogap' phase [1] . This phase appears to exist between the underdoped regime where there is no static order but only short-range correlations [2] , and the overdoped regime where antiferromagnetism disappears [3] . It is believed that the pseudogap state plays an important role in understanding the mechanism responsible for high-Tc superconductivity [4] . In recent years much attention has focused on the possibility that the pseudogap is associated with preformed pairs of charge carriers [5] . However, despite considerable experimental effort [6] , direct evidence for such pairing remains elusive [7, 8] . One possible explanation for this lack of success is that the pseudogap does not arise directly from pair formation [9] . Instead, it could result from the condensation of another type of collective mode [10] . For example, if the pseudogap were related to the onset of density wave ordering [11] then one would expect to see signatures of its presence in the form of low-energy magnetic fluctuations [12] . Indeed, several experiments have reported the detection of such fluctuations [13] - [16] .",1,0
"The cumulative spectral power (CSP) is introduced as an alternative to the traditional method in analyzing earthquake data, which has been widely used by seismologists and geophysicists since it was first proposed by Aki(1957). The new tool can be applied to both earthquakes with known locations and those without any information on their epicenters. It also provides more detailed information about the source mechanism than that obtained using the traditional method. In this study we apply the new technique to analyze two large earthquakes occurred in China during recent years. We find that the results are consistent with previous studies based on other methods. This suggests that the new tool may provide useful information for studying seismic activities. Keywords: Earthquake; Source mechanism; Cumulative spectral power. 1 Introduction. Seismological research plays an important role in understanding the physical processes involved in earthquakes. Since its introduction into seismology by Aki(1957), the traditional method of calculating the cumulative energy released by earthquakes has become one of the most popular techniques among seismologists and geophysics researchers. However, there have been some problems associated with this method such as: i)it requires accurate location of the epicenter before analysis; ii)the result depends strongly upon the choice of time window length; iii)it cannot give enough information about the source mechanisms of earthquakes. To overcome these difficulties, many attempts have been made recently to develop new tools for analyzing earthquake data. For example, Sato et al.(1989) , KaoChen(1990) , WuChiao(1991a , 1991b )and Wu(1993 developed different approaches to calculate the cumulative energy release rate. These authors found that the results were not always consistent with each other due to differences in the assumptions they had adopted.",1,0
"We study the scattering amplitudes for gluons and gravitons at strong coupling using classical string solutions in Anti-de Sitter space (AdS). We show that these amplitudes can be obtained by evaluating certain correlation functions on the worldsheet boundary, which are related to tree-level gauge theory amplitudes via holography. The results agree with those found previously using integrability techniques. In addition we find new contributions to the graviton-graviton amplitude involving an infinite tower of massive states. These arise because our solution is not invariant under global Poincare transformations; they correspond to corrections to the supergravity action induced by higher derivative terms in the bulk effective field theory.IntroductionThe AdS/CFT correspondence [1] relates type IIB superstrings propagating in ten-dimensional anti-de Sitter space-time (AdS) to conformal field theories living on its four-dimensional boundary. This duality has been used extensively over recent years as a tool to explore non-perturbative phenomena in quantum gravity [2] . It also provides a novel approach to studying strongly-coupled gauge theories such as QCD [3] . In this talk we will consider the simplest example of the AdS/CFT correspondence -the maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills (N=4 SYM) theory [4] , whose dual description involves type IIA strings moving in AdS 5 × S 5 [5] . At weak 't Hooft coupling λ = g 2 Y M N ≪ 1, where g Y M denotes the Yang-Mills coupling constant, perturbative calculations have shown that the two descriptions match exactly [6] . However, it remains unclear how to calculate quantities like scattering amplitudes directly within the gauge theory at large values of λ [7, 8] . On the other hand, one may use the AdS/CFT dictionary [9] to translate between observables calculated in either side of the duality. For instance, the expectation value of Wilson loops in the gauge theory corresponds to the area of minimal surfaces embedded into AdS [10] ; while n-point correlators of local operators in the gauge theory are given by functional integrals over n-punctured Riemann surfaces [11] .",1,0
"We present the results of our study on mass-loss rates in luminous blue variables (LBVs) based on radio observations at 1.4 GHz with the VLA, as well as optical spectroscopy obtained by us or taken from the literature.We find that LBV stars have typical mass-loss rates between 10^-6 M_sun/yr to 10^-4 M_sun/yr. The mass-loss rate is found to be correlated with luminosity but not with stellar radius. In addition we report quasi-periodic modulations of radio supernovae associated with SN 1987A and SN 1993J which are likely due to periodic changes in their circumstellar environments. These variations may also explain why these two objects were observed to undergo large amplitude outbursts during their late stages. This research was supported by NASA grant NAG5-7262.

"We study the quantum Hall effect (QHE) and its interplay with magnetism in monolayer graphene by using an effective low-energy model that takes into account both electron-electron interactions and disorder effects. We show how to derive this model starting from first principles, and we discuss some of its main properties. In particular, we find that at half-filling it exhibits two different phases depending on the strength of the Coulomb interaction between electrons. For weak coupling these are separated by a phase transition driven by spontaneous breaking of time-reversal symmetry; for strong coupling they correspond respectively to a conventional QHE state and to a novel fractionalized topological insulator characterized by chiral edge states. The latter is shown to be equivalent to a spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the honeycomb lattice, which can thus be described within the framework of the so-called SU(4) bosonic representation.",1,0

"We study the geometry and topology of generalized Lagrangian submanifolds (GLSMs) in complex symplectic manifolds, focusing on GLSMs that are special Lagrangians with respect to some Kähler form. We show how these can be constructed as holomorphic sections of certain line bundles over moduli spaces of parabolic Higgs bundles. In particular we consider the case where the base is a partial flag variety. This leads us to define new families of Calabi-Yau varieties which have been studied by physicists recently. These varieties are obtained by taking products of Grassmannian manifolds or their quotients by finite groups. The main results of this thesis are:1. A construction of GLSMs using parabolic Higgs bundles.2. An explicit description of the cohomology ring of the total space of a vector bundle associated to a parabolic Higgs bundle.3. A proof of mirror symmetry between two different types of GLSMs defined above when the base is a product of Grassmannians.",1,0
"We consider the problem of two-user MIMO broadcast channel with multiple antennas at each transmitter, receiver pair. We propose an iterative algorithm to maximize the sum capacity by jointly optimizing transmit covariance matrices for both transmitters subject to power constraints. The proposed algorithm is based on alternating optimization between the users' precoding matrices. In addition, we show that the optimal solution can be obtained in closed form when one user has more receive than transmit antennas while the other user has less or equal number of receive as well as transmit antennas. Finally, numerical results are presented to demonstrate the performance gain achieved using our proposed scheme over existing schemes. Index Terms: Broadcast Channel (BC), Iterative Algorithm, Joint Transmission, Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO). 1 Introduction Wireless communication systems have been widely deployed recently due to their high data rate transmission capability [1] . However, wireless channels suffer from multipath fading which causes severe inter-symbol interference (ISI) [2] , resulting in poor system performance. To overcome this issue, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) [3] was introduced into wireless communications. OFDM divides the available bandwidth into several narrowband subcarriers so that ISI can be reduced significantly [4] . In order to further improve spectral efficiency, multi-antenna techniques were incorporated into OFDM-based systems [5] - [8] . For example, Alamouti's space-time block coding [9] was applied to single-carrier systems [10] - [12] . Moreover, it was shown that spatial diversity could also be exploited through cooperative relaying [13] - [15] . Recently, there has been growing interest in exploiting cooperation among different nodes [16] - [18] . It was demonstrated that significant gains can be achieved if all cooperating nodes use joint transmission [19] - [21] .",1,0
"We study the effect of radiative transfer (RT) on ultraviolet pumping of the 21 cm line at high redshifts, using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with RT and without it. We find that RT can significantly enhance the strength of the 21 cm signal by up to an order of magnitude compared to calculations neglecting RT effects. The enhancement is caused mainly by Lyman-alpha photons produced inside galaxies which are absorbed outside them due to scattering off neutral hydrogen atoms. This leads to additional heating of the intergalactic medium through photoionization heating and Compton cooling. In addition we show that the inclusion of RT also changes the shape of the power spectrum of the 21 cm brightness temperature fluctuations. Our results suggest that future radio telescopes such as SKA will be able to detect this signal if they have sufficient sensitivity.

"We present the first panoramic view of the distribution of galaxies around two massive clusters at redshifts z = 0.4-0.6, using deep near-infrared imaging with WFC3 on HST. The data reveal an extended population of faint galaxies surrounding each cluster that is not seen in optical images. We find that these galaxies are predominantly blue (with median color u − g = -0.5), have low stellar masses (10^9 Msun/pc^2) and high specific star formation rates (sSFR10^-2 Gyr-1). These properties suggest they represent a recently assembled population of star-forming dwarf galaxies that were accreted by their host clusters during recent mergers. In addition to this diffuse component we also identify several dozen bright galaxies within 1 Mpc of both clusters which appear to be undergoing rapid bursts of star formation triggered by interactions between infalling gas-rich galaxies and the hot intracluster medium.",1,0
"We present an exact expression for the probability distribution function (PDF) of the number of steps taken by a one-dimensional, discrete-time, self-propelled particle that moves in a periodic potential and interacts with itself via elastic collisions.We show how this PDF can be used to calculate the mean-square displacement as well as other statistical properties of such particles. The results are illustrated using numerical simulations.PACS numbers: 05.45.-a; 05.70.Jk; 05.60.GgI. INTRODUCTORY REMARkS The motion of many biological systems is often described as being driven by internal forces or active processes [1] . Examples include bacteria swimming through fluids [2] , cells crawling on surfaces [3] , and molecular motors moving along cytoskeletal filaments [4] . In recent years there has been growing interest in understanding the dynamics of these active particles [5] - [8] . In particular, it was shown that their behavior may differ significantly from that observed in passive Brownian particles [9] - [11] . For example, while the latter exhibit normal diffusion at large timescales [12] , active particles typically display superdiffusive [13] or even ballistic [14] transport depending on the details of their interactions [15] - [17] . This difference arises because active particles have additional degrees of freedom which allow them to explore more efficiently the available space [18] . As a result they tend to move faster than passive particles [19] . Recently we introduced a model describing the motion of a single active particle [20] . It consists of a point-like object that performs a biased random walk in a periodic potential [21] . Its position x(t + 1) = x(t) + v t+1 − v t is determined by its velocity v t+1 = f [x(t), v t ] where f [·] denotes some deterministic force acting upon the particle [22] . Here we consider two different types of potentials V (x). First, when V (x) ∝ cos(2πx/L) (L is the periodicity length), the system exhibits a series of metastable states separated by energy barriers [23] . Second",1,0
"We present an analysis of the broadband (0.5-10 keV) X-ray spectrum of the radio galaxy 3C 445, using data obtained with XMM-Newton and Chandra observatories in 2001-2002 . The observed X-ray emission is dominated by a hard power-law component which can be fitted equally well either by thermal Comptonization or non-thermal inverse Compton scattering models. We find that both models require a large amount of cold matter to produce the soft excess below 1 keV. This suggests that there are two distinct components contributing to the X-ray emission - one associated with hot plasma and another related to cool gas clouds. In addition we detect several narrow absorption lines at energies corresponding to highly ionized species such as O vii , Ne ix , Mg xi and Si xiii . These features may originate in outflows driven by nuclear activity. Finally, we report on the detection of Fe Kα line at 6.4 keV produced by reflection off distant material.",1,0
"We present an efficient method for simulating the formation of large-scale structure in the early universe, including reionization by stars and quasars. Our approach is based on a combination of N-body simulations with semi-analytic models that describe galaxy formation and evolution within dark matter halos. We use this technique to study how galaxies form at high redshifts (z > 6) when the first luminous objects appear. The results are compared against observations of high-redshift galaxies obtained using the Hubble Space Telescope. This work was supported by NASA grant NNX08AG84G. In recent years there has been considerable progress in understanding the physical processes involved in galaxy formation. However, many open questions remain about the nature of these processes as well as their dependence on cosmological parameters such as the density parameter Ω_m or the amplitude of primordial fluctuations σ_8. One important goal of modern observational astronomy is to answer some of these questions through detailed studies of distant galaxies.",1,0
"We present new near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and photometry for the Herbig Be star HD 98800, which is surrounded by an optically thick dust disk with a radius of200 AU. The NIR spectrum shows strong emission lines of H I, He II, C III, O IV-VI, Si IV, S VI, Fe II, Mg II, Al II-III, Na I, Ca II, and K I in addition to absorption features due to stellar winds. We find that the observed line profiles are consistent with those predicted by magnetohydrodynamic models of accretion disks around young stars. In particular, we detect blueshifted absorptions associated with infalling gas streams along magnetic field lines onto the central star. These results suggest that HD 98800 has been undergoing active mass accretion over the past few million years.Keywords: Accretion, Herbig Be star",1,0
"We report on the observation of strong electron-phonon interaction (EPI) in heavily boron-doped epitaxial graphene grown on SiC(0001). The EPI is found to be enhanced by more than one order of magnitude compared with that observed for undoped graphene, which can be attributed to the formation of a Dirac point at high doping levels and its associated van Hove singularity near the Fermi level. This finding suggests that the EPI in doped graphene may be tunable over several orders of magnitude through chemical or electrostatic gating.Graphene has attracted considerable attention because it exhibits unique physical properties such as extremely high carrier mobility1-5 and very large optical nonlinearities6-8. However, these remarkable properties are often accompanied by weak interactions between electrons and phonons9-11, which limit their applications in high-speed electronics12-14 and optoelectronics15-17. In this work we demonstrate that the EPI in heavily boron-doping epitaxial graphene grown by thermal decomposition of SiC18-20 can be significantly enhanced due to the presence of a Dirac point21-23 and its associated van Hov singularity24-26 near the Fermi energy EF. We show that the EPI increases rapidly when the Fermi level crosses the van Hove singularity, resulting in a giant increase in the electron-phonon scattering rate. Our results suggest that the EPI in graphene could be controlled electrically via chemical or electrostatic gated27-30, thereby opening up new avenues towards novel devices based on graphene.Graphene is known to have extremely high carrier mobilities1-4 but relatively small electron-phonon couplings5-9. These two competing effects determine the performance of graphene-based electronic and optoelectronic devices10-12. For example, the low EPI leads to slow relaxation rates13-15 and thus limits the operation speed of graphene transistors14-16. On the other hand, the high mobility makes graphene attractive for use in high-speed electronics17-19 and ultrafast photodetectors20. Therefore, there exists great interest in developing methods to enhance the EPI while maintaining the high mobility31",1,0
"We report on new close binary systems discovered by searching for white dwarf companions to cataclysmic variables using data obtained with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's first year of operation, Data Release 5. We find that most of these binaries are likely to be double-degenerate systems consisting of two helium white dwarfs or one carbon-oxygen white dwarf plus another degenerate object such as a neutron star or black hole. The majority of our sample have orbital periods less than 1 hour; we also identify several candidates which may contain magnetic white dwarfs. These results will help us understand how common double-degenerate mergers might be among all type Ia supernovae.Keywords: Double-degenerate systems; Type Ia supernovae; Close binary stars; Sloan Digital Sky Survey; Cataclysmic Variables; White dwarfs; Helium white dwarfs; Carbon-oxygen white dwarfs",1,0
"We present the results of an extensive survey for absorption lines in high-resolution spectra of quasars at redshifts z < 0.3, obtained with HST/STIS (the Hubble Space Telescope Spectrograph). The sample consists of 12 QSOs observed over a total exposure time of about 1 Ms. We detect more than 1000 Lyman alpha forest absorbers along each line-of-sight to these QSOs; we also find that most sight-lines show strong absorption by high-ionization species such as C IV and Si IV. In addition, we identify several hundred systems showing absorption due to highly ionized oxygen, O VI . These are among the strongest known O VI absorbers anywhere in the universe. By combining our data set with previous surveys, we obtain new constraints on the physical conditions of this gas phase. Our main conclusions are:-The number density of O VI absorbers per unit redshift is n(O VI) = 2.6 +/- 0.4 x 10^-3 cm^-3 , which corresponds to a mean separation between absorber pairs of r = 4.1 +/- 0.5 h-1 Gpc.-Most O VI absorbers have temperatures T10 5 K and densities log ne/cm -3 > 13.8. About half of them appear to be associated with galaxies within 50 kpc projected distance. -There appears to be no correlation between the properties of O VI absorbers and those of their host galaxy population.",1,0
"We present new observations and analysis of the pulsar–disk system PSR 1257+12, which is one of only two known systems in which a millisecond radio pulsar orbits around an evolved star (a white dwarf). We have obtained high-resolution near-infrared images with adaptive optics at Keck Observatory that reveal a bright ring-like structure surrounding the pulsar's position. This feature has been interpreted as emission from dust grains orbiting within the disk produced by the supernova explosion that created both stars.In addition to this ring, we detect faint extended emission extending out to several hundred AU on either side of the central source. These features are consistent with previous results based on lower resolution data. However, our higher spatial resolution reveals additional details about these structures. For example, we find evidence for spiral arms in the outer regions of the disk, which may be caused by gravitational interactions between the disk and the binary companion.",1,0
"We consider the probability distribution of the number of times that a simple random walk on an infinite graph visits some fixed vertex in finite time, and show how this can be approximated by a Poisson distribution with mean equal to the expected value of the number of visits.We then use these results to prove that the total variation distance between the two distributions is bounded above by O(1/n) where n denotes the number of vertices in the graph.This result generalizes previous work which was restricted to graphs whose degree sequence has exponential decay or polynomial growth.The proof relies heavily upon recent advances in the theory of large deviations for sums of dependent Bernoulli variables. In particular we make use of the so-called Cramér-Chernoff method as well as the concept of a supermartingale. Finally, we apply our main theorem to obtain new bounds on the mixing time of lazy random walks on regular trees.",1,0
"We study the phenomenological consequences of radion stabilization by introducing an explicit mass term for the radion into realistic warped space models with bulk gauge fields and fermions. We find that, depending on the model parameters, there are two possible scenarios which can be realized at low energies: (i) The radion is heavy enough to decouple from all Standard Model particles. (ii) The radion couples directly to Standard Model particles but its effects are suppressed due to mixing between the radion and the Higgs boson. In both cases we show how the radion affects precision electroweak observables such as S, T , W , Y . Finally, we discuss the possibility of detecting the radion through direct production at future colliders. Introduction: One of the most interesting features of Randall-Sundrum type I [1] or II [2] models is their ability to generate hierarchies among fundamental scales without fine-tuning [3] . However, these models suffer from the presence of a scalar field called the radion whose vacuum expectation value determines the size of extra dimensions [4] . In this work we consider the case where the radion acquires a large mass so it does not affect low-energy physics [5] . On the other hand, if the radion remains light then it may have observable effects [6] - [8] . For example, one could imagine that the radion mixes strongly with the Higgs boson leading to deviations from standard predictions [9] . Alternatively, the radion might couple directly to Standard Model particles [10] . In either scenario, the radion would contribute to precision electroweak measurements [11] - [13] . This motivates us to investigate whether the radion has any effect on precision electroweak data within realistic warped space models [14] - [16] .",1,0
"We present 8.4 GHz Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) images and light curves for the supernova remnant (SNR) associated with the Type IIb supernova SN2004et, which exploded in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 6946 on 2004 September 24 UT1. The radio emission is dominated by two bright components separated by0.5 arcsec at all epochs observed between 2005 January and 2007 December. We find that both components are expanding with velocities of5000 km/s, consistent with previous estimates based on single-dish data. However, we also detect significant proper motions of1000 km/s for each component over this period. These results suggest an age of about 3 years for the SNR, implying a distance to NGC 6946 of 4 Mpc. This value is significantly smaller than previously estimated distances to this object using other methods. Our measurements provide new constraints on models of core-collapse supernovae.Keywords: Supernova remnants",1,0
"We present an analysis of star-formation activity associated with low radio luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) using data from the Sloan DigitalSky Survey (SDSS). We find that these objects are typically hosted by massive galaxies, and have high specific star formation rates compared to inactive galaxies at similar redshifts. The majority of our sample is found to be obscured by dusty torii, as indicated by their optical colors and infrared emission. These results suggest that there may exist two populations of AGN: one which hosts significant amounts of star formation, and another where no such activity is observed. This work was supported by NASA grant NNG05GJ40G. Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), powered by supermassive black holes accreting matter from surrounding gas clouds, are known to produce copious quantities of radiation across all wavelengths. However, it has been unclear whether this energy output also leads to enhanced levels of star formation within host galaxies. In order to investigate this question we use data from the SloanDigital Sky Survey (SDSS; York et al., 2000) , specifically targeting sources classified as narrow-line Seyfert 1's (NLS1s) based on their optical spectra. NLS1s represent a subclass of AGNs whose properties differ significantly from those of more typical broad line quasars (BLQs; OsterbrockPogge 1985) . They tend to reside in lower mass galaxies than BLQSOs, and exhibit higher Eddington ratios (Boller et al., 1996; Grupe, Thomas,Leighly 1999; Mathur 2000; Komossa et al., 2006a ,b Gallo 2007 .",1,0
"We present an in-depth study of the galaxy cluster Z3146, which is one of the most luminous clusters in X-rays known to date (Lx = 1.5 x 1045 erg/s). The main goal of this work was to investigate whether or not there are any signatures of AGN activity associated with the central cD galaxy. We have obtained deep optical spectroscopy for more than 100 galaxies within the virial radius of the cluster using the Keck telescope. In addition we have carried out Chandra observations that allow us to resolve individual point sources down to luminosities as low as Lx3 x 1041 erg/s. Our results show that:-The brightest cluster galaxy has a very complex spectrum dominated by emission lines produced by gas ionized by hot stars.-There is no evidence for significant nuclear activity in the form of broad line regions and/or high excitation narrow-line regions.-The total mass profile derived from our spectroscopic data agrees well with previous estimates based on gravitational lensing measurements.",1,0
"We study the second-harmonic (SH) and third-harmonic (TH) generations in an inhomogeneously broadened cavity with two different resonance frequencies for fundamental wave (FW). We show that, when the intracavity FW intensity reaches its maximum value, both SHG and THG can be enhanced simultaneously by increasing the pumping rate or decreasing the detuning between the two modes. The enhancement is due to the fact that the nonlinear susceptibility becomes larger than zero at this point. This effect has been observed experimentally recently.In addition, we find that there exists another regime where only one type of harmonics can be generated efficiently while suppressing other types of harmonics. For example, if the intracavity FW field is tuned close to the lower mode frequency, then it will generate mainly SH light but very little TH light; on the contrary, if the intracavty FW field is tuned near the upper mode frequency, then it generates mainly TH light but almost no SH light.",1,0
"We report the observation of electron-hole puddles in graphene using scanning single-electron transistors (SETs). The SET is fabricated on top of an exfoliated monolayer graphene flake and operated at cryogenic temperatures down to 4 K. We observe that the conductance through the SET depends strongly on its position with respect to the underlying graphene sheet, which we attribute to local variations in charge carrier density induced by charged impurities trapped between the substrate and the graphene layer. This effect can be suppressed by applying a gate voltage Vg = -40 V across the graphene sample. Our results demonstrate that the use of SETs as probes for studying electronic properties of two-dimensional materials such as graphene has great potential. In recent years there have been significant advances in the fabrication of devices based on carbon nanotubes [1] , silicon nanowires [2] or semiconductor quantum dots [3] . These nanostructures are used as active elements in various types of sensors [4] , optoelectronic [5] and photovoltaic [6] applications. However, these structures suffer from several drawbacks including poor reproducibility due to their small size and low yield during growth processes [7, 8] . In contrast, graphene [9] offers many advantages over other two dimensional materials [10] : it is mechanically flexible [11] , chemically stable [12] , biocompatible [13] and electrically conductive [14] . Moreover, it can be produced in large quantities via chemical vapor deposition [15] or mechanical exfoliation [16] techniques [17] . Recently, graphene-based field-effect transistors [18] were demonstrated [19, 20] opening up new avenues towards high-performance electronics [21] . Despite all these attractive features, however, one major challenge remains in achieving high-quality electrical contacts to graphene [22] .",1,0
"We present the results of our study on fundamental parameters of helium-weak (He-W) stars, which are evolved red giants with helium abundance Y=0.25-0.40 in their envelopes.We have calculated evolutionary tracks for these stars using the Yale Rotating Evolution Code including diffusion processes as well as nuclear reactions relevant to stellar evolution up to carbon burning stage. The mass loss rates were taken into account by adopting Reimers formula. In order to investigate the effect of rotation on the structure and evolution of He-W stars we performed calculations for different initial rotational velocities ranging from 0 to 300 km/sec.The comparison between theoretical predictions and observations shows that there is no agreement between theory and observation if one adopts standard values of mixing length parameter α = 1.9-2.1. However, it was found that the best fit can be obtained when the value of α is reduced down to 1.5 ± 0.1.",1,0
"We present the results of our study on the possible existence and stability of terrestrial planets around the star Gliese 581, which is located at about 20 light-years away from Earth. We have performed numerical simulations for different orbital configurations of three hypothetical terrestrial planets with masses ranging between 1 to 10 times that of Earth's mass (1-10 M⊕). Our calculations show that all these systems are dynamically stable over time scales longer than 100 Myr. The most massive planet has an eccentric orbit with e=0.2 and its periastron distance ranges between 0.05 AU and 0.15 AU depending on the initial conditions used. This planet can be considered as a hot Jupiter-like planet because it orbits very close to its host star. However, we find that there exists another region where two or more terrestrial planets may exist stably. In this region, one of them could be a super-Earth-type planet with a mass larger than 5M⊕ but smaller than 8M⊕.",1,0
"We consider the controllability properties for linearized models of mechanical systems evolving on Lie groups, with particular emphasis on the case where the configuration space is the group of rigid motions in three dimensions. We show that these systems are not locally controllable around any equilibrium point unless they have an additional symmetry which we call “isotropy”. This result has important consequences for the study of ideal fluid flows governed by Euler's equations. In fact, it implies that such flows cannot be controlled at all if their initial conditions belong to certain invariant sets (the so-called vortex cores). The results presented here were obtained during my PhD thesis under the supervision of Prof. Miroslav Krstic at ETH Zurich. I would like to thank him as well as Dr. David J. Simoes for many useful discussions about this work. Controllability problems arise naturally when one considers optimal control or feedback stabilization questions for dynamical systems. For example, given some desired state trajectory x_d(t), one may ask whether there exists a control input u(t) steering the system from its current state x towards the target trajectory x_d(t), ∀ t∈ [0,T] within finite time T.In general, the answer to this question depends strongly on the choice of the cost functional used to measure the distance between trajectories. However, if one restricts attention to quadratic costs, then the problem becomes much more tractable since it can be formulated as a convex optimization program over the set of admissible controls. Moreover, if the dynamics evolve on a vector space, then the solution to this problem always exists; see e.g., [1] . Unfortunately, things become considerably more complicated if the underlying state space is a manifold instead; see [2] , [3, Chapter 4][4]-[6] . Indeed, even though the problem remains convex whenever the cost function is quadratic, the existence of solutions no longer follows automatically [7]; see also [8] - [10] .In recent years, several authors have studied the controllability properties of various classes of nonlinear systems evolving on manifolds using",1,0
"The generalized twistor transform is an extension of the ordinary twistor transform to include particles with spin in arbitrary dimensions. It has been used recently for describing scattering amplitudes involving massive particles as well as massless ones. In this talk I will present some new results on the subject including a description of how one can use it to describe particles beyond free or massless theories. The talk will also cover recent developments related to dualities between different quantum field theories. This includes duality relations that have been found using the generalized twistor transform such as those relating N=4 super Yang-Mills theory to self-dual gravity and its supersymmetric extensions. Finally we will discuss how these ideas are connected to string theory. Generalized twistors were introduced by Witten more than twenty years ago [1] . They provide a powerful tool for studying gauge theories in general relativity [2] , and they play important roles in understanding various aspects of string/M-theory [3] . In particular, the so-called Penrose limit [4] provides a way to relate scattering amplitudes in gauge/gravity theories at weak coupling to correlation functions in conformal field theories (CFTs) at strong coupling [5] . Recently there has been renewed interest in the study of twistors [6] - [11] due to their applications in computing scattering amplitudes [12] - [16] . For example, the tree-level S-matrix elements of gluons [17] and gravitons [18] in four-dimensional N = 4 Super-Yang-Mills theory (SYM), which was conjectured to be dual to type-IIB superstrings [19] , were computed via the generalized twistor transform [20] .",1,0
"We present the first calculation of quark-quark scattering at next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy within the framework of multiple parton scattering (MPI). We show that this process is dominated by gluons and quarks with small transverse momenta, which are produced via initial state radiation off one or both incoming hadrons. The cross section for quark-quark scattering can be written as an integral over the transverse momentum distribution of these radiated particles times their squared matrix element. This allows us to calculate the total cross section using standard Monte Carlo techniques. In addition we provide analytic expressions for the differential distributions in rapidity and azimuthal angle between the outgoing quarks. Our results agree well with those obtained numerically. Finally, we discuss how our formalism could be used to study MPI effects on jet production in proton-nucleus collisions. PACS numbers: 12.38.Qk, 13 .60.Le",1,0
"We present an analysis of cosmological shock waves in the large scale structure (LSS) of the universe, which are generated by gravitational collapse and merging processes between dark matter haloes. We show that these shocks can be detected as discontinuities in the density field traced by galaxy clusters using weak lensing observations. In addition to their gravitational effects on the LSS, we find that they also produce non-gravitational signatures such as: i) anisotropic pressure gradients; ii) bulk motions; iii) temperature fluctuations; iv) magnetic fields. These effects may have important consequences for our understanding of the formation and evolution of large-scale structures. The detection of these phenomena will provide new insights into the physics behind cosmic acceleration.Keywords: Cosmology, Cosmic Acceleration, Dark Matter Halos, Weak Gravitational Lensing, Galaxy Clusters1 IntroductionRecent observational data suggest that the expansion history of the Universe is accelerating at late times [1–3] . This phenomenon has been explained within the framework of general relativity with the introduction of a mysterious component known as 'dark energy' [4] , whose nature remains unknown today. However, it seems clear that this exotic form of energy must play some role in explaining the observed accelerated expansion of the universe [5–7] .In order to understand how dark energy affects the dynamics of the universe, one needs to study its interaction with other components of the cosmos. One possible way to do so is through the use of numerical simulations [8–10] . Another possibility consists of studying the effect of dark energy on the growth rate of perturbations [11–13] . Finally, another approach involves analyzing the statistical properties of the distribution of galaxies [14–18] or galaxy clusters [19–21] .",1,0
"In this work, we study the renormalization group equations (RGEs) for extra U(1) supersymmetric string inspired model with heavy Z' prime and its effects on gauge coupling unification at one-loop level. We find that the inclusion of new particles such as vector-like quarks and leptons can significantly affect the running behavior of gauge couplings. In particular, it is found that the presence of these new particles leads to an enhancement effect on the evolution speed of gauge couplings which may be helpful to solve the gauge hierarchy problem. Furthermore, by using the experimental data of low energy physics, we obtain some constraints on the mass spectrum of extra particles involved in our model. Finally, we also discuss briefly about the possible signatures of heavy Z'-prime boson at future colliders. The results are summarized below.I. INTRODUCTORY REMARK The Standard Model (SM), based on SU(3) C ×SU(2) L ×U(1) Y gauge symmetry, has been very successful in describing all known phenomena upto TeV scale energies [1] . However, there exist several open questions related to SM like fermion masses and mixing angles [2] , neutrino oscillations [3] etc., which cannot be explained within the framework of SM. To address these issues, many extensions beyond SM have been proposed [4] - [8] . Among them, Grand Unified Theory (GUTs) [9] provides a natural solution to the above mentioned problems [10] . It predicts the existence of superheavy gauge bosons called GUT-scale gauge bosons [11] whose masses lie around 10 16 GeV [12] . These GUT-scale gauge boson interactions lead to non-renormalizable operators [13] which break the SM gauge symmetries [14] . Therefore, they should not appear in any physical process [15] . This implies that their contributions must vanish when summed over all states [16] . Thus, the appearance of these nonrenormalizable operators will spoil the successes of SM [17] .",1,0
"The SNO+ experiment is designed to measure the neutrino fluxes in the energy range between 1 MeV and 20 MeV, with an expected sensitivity at low energies comparable to that achieved by Super-Kamiokande (SK). The measurement will be performed using two detection techniques: charged-current interactions on deuterium nuclei via elastic scattering off electrons; neutral current reactions on carbon nuclei through coherent elastic scattering off neutrons.In this work we present results for the predicted rates of these processes as well as their uncertainties based on state-of-the-art Standard Solar Models (SSMs) and nuclear cross sections. We also discuss how the experimental data can help to constrain SSM parameters such as the helium abundance YHe or the heavy element abundances Z/X. Finally, we show how the combination of different experiments may allow us to test whether the observed neutrinos are produced mainly in pp-chain fusion reactions or in CNO cycles.",1,0
"We study the production of a sterile species in an open system with two stable particles and one unstable particle, where the decay products are not observed.We show that if the initial state is pure then there exists no final mixed state which can be reached by unitary evolution. This result implies that the production of a sterility cannot occur under any circumstances for such systems. If we allow the possibility to prepare arbitrary states as input, however, it turns out that the production of a certain kind of sterility may still take place. In this case, the output state will always contain some amount of entanglement between the subsystems corresponding to the different types of particles involved. The results presented here have been obtained within the framework of Quantum Kinetic Theory (QKT). QKT provides a description of non-equilibrium phenomena at mesoscopic scales based on the concept of entropy production rate. It has recently attracted considerable attention due to its potential applications in many areas ranging from physics to biology.I. INTRODUCTORY REMARK The phenomenon of spontaneous emission plays a crucial role in modern physics. For example, it is responsible for the cooling process in laser-cooling experiments [1] . On the other hand, spontaneous emission also leads to decoherence effects [2] , which limit the performance of quantum information processing devices [3] . In recent years, several authors [4] - [8] studied the problem of producing a particular type of 'sterility' in open quantum systems. A state is called 'sterile' when it does not interact with itself or another given set of states [9] . More specifically, let us consider a bipartite Hilbert space H = H 1 ⊗H 2 , where dim(H i ) = N i . Then, a density matrix ρ ∈ B(H) is said to be 'sterile' wrt. a subset S ⊆ H iff Tr[ρσ] = 0 for all σ ∈ S. Here, Tr denotes the trace operation over either H 1 or H 2 depending on whether σ belongs to H 1 or H 2 respectively. Note that the notion of 'ster",1,0
"We present the results on the super quantum mechanics (SQM) in dimer models with free fermion boundary conditions. We show that SQM is equivalent to the usual quantum mechanics for periodic boundary condition case. In addition we find that there are two different types of supersymmetric ground states depending on whether or not the number of particles N is even. For odd N , the ground state has zero energy but it does not have any degeneracy. On the other hand, when N is even, the ground state becomes doubly degenerate. The degeneracy can be understood by using the concept of parity symmetry breaking. Finally we discuss how our result fits into the general framework of supersymmetry. PACS: 11.10.Wx, 05.45.Mt, 11.15.TkI. INTRODUCTORY REMARK In this work we study the super quantum mechanics ( S Q M ) i n d im e r m odels w ith f ree fermi b oundary c o ndition s . T hese models were first introduced by Rokhsar et al [1] as an exactly solvable model which describes spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square lattice. They showed that these models exhibit many interesting properties such as spontaneous dimerization at low temperatures [2] . The main purpose of this work is to investigate the effect of boundary conditions on the supersymmetric structure of the system. It turns out that the supersymmetric structure depends crucially on the boundary conditions imposed on the system. As will become clear later, the supersymmetric structure changes drastically if one switches between periodic and free-fermion boundary conditions.",1,0
"In this work, we propose a novel cross-layer scheme to improve the performance of distributed wireless ad hoc networks (DWAHNs). The proposed scheme is based on an adaptive routing protocol and a dynamic channel allocation algorithm. In particular, our approach uses a new metric called 'expected transmission count' in order to select routes with minimum expected number of transmissions per packet delivery. Furthermore, it employs a modified version of the well-known proportional fairness criterion as well as a utility function that takes into account both the current network conditions and user preferences. Finally, the proposed scheme also incorporates a mechanism which allows nodes to dynamically change their operating channels according to the traffic load at each node. Extensive simulation experiments are conducted using NS-2 simulator to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme under different scenarios. Results show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing approaches by achieving higher throughput while maintaining low end-to-end delay and packet loss rate.",1,0
"The Galois group is the fundamental object in classical Galois theory, which studies the solvability of polynomial equations over finite fields.In this talk we will introduce the notion of “Galois groups” for infinite families of polynomials and study their properties using tools from algebraic geometry.We will also discuss some applications to number theory such as the proof of the abc conjecture by Vojta (joint work with J. Pila). The main results are joint works with A. Chambert-Loir, D. Ghioca, M. Harris, C. Lairez, S. Popescu-Tarauca, B. Stoll, E. Szpiro, T. Tucker-Drob, and V. Vojta.

"The design and kinematics analysis of parallel kinematic machine tools (PKMTs) is presented in this work using kinetic-static performance criteria. The proposed approach considers the dynamic behavior of PKMTs during their operation, which has been neglected by previous works on PKMTs. In addition to the static stiffness matrix, the inertia properties are also considered for the evaluation of the overall dynamic response of PKMTs. A new method based on the concept of virtual joints is developed to calculate the mass distribution along each leg of the PKMT under consideration. This information can be used as an input data set for further dynamic analyses such as modal or harmonic vibration analysis. Finally, two different PKMTs with three degrees-of-freedom per joint are designed and analyzed using the proposed methodology. It was found that the first PKMT exhibits better dynamic characteristics than its counterpart due to its lower natural frequencies and higher damping ratios.",1,0
"We report on the detection and characterization of two transit-like events observed with Spitzer Space Telescope (Werner et al., 2004) at 3.6 microns, which we interpret as being due to planets orbiting an M-dwarf star located near the center of the open cluster NGC 6791.The first event was detected during our initial survey of this field using the IRAC camera on board Spitzer between 2005 May 24 and 2006 January 1.We subsequently obtained follow-up observations over three epochs spanning more than one year that allowed us to confirm its planetary nature by detecting it again in all four bands simultaneously.This is only the second time such a confirmation has been made after the original discovery observation.The second event was discovered serendipitously while searching for additional transiting objects around the same target star following up on the first event.Both events are characterized by their short duration (∼3 hours), shallow depth (0.1",1,0
"We study the dynamics of a probabilistic cellular automaton (PCA) with two species, prey and predators, which interact in an oscillatory way. The PCA is defined on a square lattice where each site can be occupied by at most one particle of either type. We show that for certain values of the parameters there are stable periodic solutions to this system. These results are obtained using a mean field approximation method. In particular we find that the periodicity depends only on the number of particles per unit area. This dependence agrees well with numerical simulations performed on finite lattices. Finally, we discuss how our model could be used as a simple description of population cycles observed in nature. Probabilistic cellular automata have been widely studied during recent years due to their potential applications in many fields such as physics [1] , biology [2] or computer science [3] . They consist of a set of cells arranged in some regular structure like a grid [4] whose state evolves according to local rules depending on its own state and those of its neighbors [5] . In this work we consider a two-dimensional probabilistic cellular automaton [6] consisting of N sites located on a square lattice L = Z 2 . Each cell i ∈ L has four possible states denoted by 0, 1, 2 and 3 corresponding respectively to empty space, prey, predator and dead. At time t = 0 all sites are initialized randomly with probability p 0 = 1/4 of being vacant, p 1 = 1/2 of having a prey and p 2 = 1/4 of containing a predator. Then, the evolution rule consists of applying simultaneously the following transition probabilities between consecutive times t and t + 1:",1,0
"We present an analysis of peculiar velocities in the local universe, based on data obtained by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We use a sample of galaxies with measured redshifts and distances to construct a map of the velocity field around us. The resulting flow is dominated by coherent motions that are consistent with our location within a void centered at about 50 Mpc distance. This result confirms earlier findings using different methods.In addition we find evidence for a dipole component in this flow which points away from the center of the void towards Virgo. Our results suggest that the bulk motion of matter in the nearby universe may be influenced by large-scale structure. These results have implications for cosmological models as well as for studies of galaxy formation and evolution. They also provide new constraints on theories of dark energy.

"We present an analysis of the fundamental limits on position determination using concentration gradients in biological systems, such as bacteria and neurons. We show that these limits are determined by the number of molecules available for measurement at each location along the gradient. The optimal strategy is to measure all locations with equal precision; this leads to a limit on the accuracy of position determination given by 1/√(N) where N is the total number of molecules measured across the entire system. This result holds even if we allow arbitrary prior information about the distribution of positions within the system. Our results provide insight into how cells can optimally use concentration gradients to determine their positions relative to other cells or external cues. In addition, our results suggest new ways to improve existing techniques used to track cell migration over time.Bacteria and neurons both sense chemical concentrations through receptors located throughout their surfaces. These receptors convert local chemical concentrations into electrical signals which are then transmitted back to the cell body via specialized signaling pathways. As a consequence, the amount of signal received depends not only upon the local concentration but also upon the distance between the receptor and the source of the signal (see Figure 1). For example, when a bacterium senses a nutrient molecule it will produce more signal if the nutrient is closer than if it were farther away. Similarly, when a neuron receives input from another neuron, its response will depend upon whether the synapse connecting them lies close to the center of the cell's dendritic tree or near one of its tips.",1,0
"We present the first measurement of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass function for both early-(elliptical/S0, Sa-Sb) and latetype (Scd-Sm) galaxies using data from the Millennium Galaxy Catalogue (MGC). We use two different methods to measure SMBH masses - stellar velocity dispersion measurements and bulge luminosity scaling relations. Our results show that there is no significant difference between the SMBH mass functions of these galaxy types at z < 0.1. However we find evidence for an evolution with redshift such that the number density of massive SMBHs decreases more rapidly than less-massive ones. This suggests that the most massive SMBHs are likely to have grown by accretion over cosmic time rather than merging events. These findings will be important constraints on models of SMBH growth and AGN feedback.",1,0
"We present new rest-UV spectra for four Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) with redshifts between 5 and 6, obtained using the Ultraviolet Echelle Spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope.The data are used to measure the interstellar medium properties in these objects by fitting models to their observed absorption line profiles. We find that all four LBGs have high metallicities ranging from 0.2 solar to 1 solar, which is consistent with previous results based on optical spectroscopy. In addition we detect strong outflows in three of our targets, as evidenced by blueshifted interstellar absorption lines. These observations suggest that massive stars may be responsible for driving galactic-scale winds even before reionization has completed. This work was supported by NASA grant HST-GO-10775.01-A awarded through the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by AURA under NASA contract NAS5-26555.",1,0
"We present an algorithm for computing non-abelian gauge theories in two different ways, which we call 'directly' and 'indirectly'. The directly computed quantities are related to those obtained by standard Monte Carlo techniques via Feynman rules. In contrast, indirectly computed quantities can be evaluated without any reference to Feynman diagrams or perturbation theory at all. We demonstrate that both computations agree with each other within statistical errors over several orders of magnitude in lattice spacing and volume. This provides strong evidence that our approach is correct. Finally, we show how this method allows us to compute observables such as glueball masses and decay constants accurately even when they cannot be extracted using conventional methods. Introduction: Gauge theories play a central role in particle physics. However, it has been notoriously difficult to study them numerically because of their nonperturbative nature. Here we propose a new numerical technique based on dual formulations of quantum field theories (QFTs) [1] . Duality transformations relate QFTs formulated in terms of fields living on spacetime points to equivalent ones defined in terms of fields living only on links between these points [2] . In particular, we consider SU(Nc) Yang-Mills theories coupled to fermions transforming according to some representation R of SU(Nc). These theories have a number of interesting physical applications ranging from nuclear physics [3] , where Nc= 3, to high-energy phenomenology [4] , where Nc> 4. For example, one may use this formalism to calculate hadronic matrix elements relevant for precision measurements of Standard Model parameters [5] .",1,0
"We study the stringy e-functions of smooth hypersurfaces in weighted projective spaces, which are defined by the generating functions for Gromov-Witten invariants with insertions of arbitrary genus zero descendant classes. We show that these functions can be written as certain infinite products over all prime ideals in the homogeneous coordinate ring of the ambient space. As an application we give explicit formulas for the stringy e-function of any smooth hypersurface in ℙ^n(𝒪_ℂ) or in ℙ^n(t_1^a_1, ..., t_r^a_0) (with a_i ≥ 1). In particular this gives new proofs of the results of Batyrev-Borisov on the stringy Hodge numbers of Calabi-Yau varieties.The second part is devoted to the stringy e-functons of Brieskorn-Pham singularities. These are given by the generating series for Gromov-Wittet invariants with insertions only of one-pointed genus-zero descendent classes. We prove that they also have an expression as infinite products over all prime ideal in their homogeneous coordinate rings. This allows us to compute explicitly the stringy e-functons of many examples including the quintic threefold and its generalizations.",1,0
"We present the results obtained by applying the semi-analytic code VESPA to model the evolution of galaxies in the Millennium Simulation, including chemical enrichment as well as dust extinction effects on their observed properties.We show that our models reproduce many observational trends for different types of galaxies at z=0 (e.g., luminosity functions), but also predict some new ones which can be tested with future surveys such as Euclid or LSST. In particular we find that:- The predicted number density of massive quiescent galaxies is too high compared to observations; this problem could be alleviated if AGN feedback were more efficient than assumed here. - Our predictions are consistent with current estimates of the cosmic SFRD out to redshifts of about 4.5, although they tend to overpredict it slightly beyond that redshift. - At low masses (Mstar < 10^10 Msun) there appears to be an excess of blue galaxies relative to red galaxies in both the real Universe and in our simulations. This may indicate that either our treatment of supernova feedback and/or reionization physics needs improvement, or else that these processes have been affected by baryonic effects not included in our simulation.",1,0
"We present an absolute calibration of MIPS photometry at 24, 70, and 160 microns using stellar calibrators observed by the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope. We use these observations to derive corrections that account for differences in aperture size between IRAC and MIPS as well as color-dependent effects due to differing filter profiles. These corrections are applied to all sources detected with signal-to-noise ratios greater than 5 in each band. For fainter sources we apply additional corrections based upon the measured fluxes of bright stars within the same field-of-view. This method is used to calibrate over 1 million objects across the sky. We find excellent agreement between our results and those obtained independently by other groups. Our final uncertainties include contributions from both statistical errors and systematics associated with the choice of stellar calibrators. We also provide estimates of the uncertainty introduced into the derived colors when applying this technique.",1,0
"The present study investigates the structural properties of Early Modern English syntax by applying network analysis to data obtained through corpus linguistics techniques. The results show that, in general terms, syntactic networks are characterized by high clustering coefficients and low average path lengths. In addition, it is shown how these two parameters can be used as indicators for identifying different types of syntactic structures. Finally, some possible applications of this approach are discussed. Keywords: Network Analysis; Corpus Linguistics; Syntactic Structures; Clustering Coefficients; Average Path Lengths. 1 Introduction A growing number of studies have been carried out recently using network theory (WattsStrogatz 1998 , Newman 2003a ) to investigate various aspects of language structure (Ferrer-i-Cancho 2004 , Ferrer-i-Cancho et al 2005 . These investigations have mainly focused on phonological systems (e.g., Ferrer-i-Cancho 2002 , Ferrer-i-CanchoSolé 2007 or lexical-semantic relations (e.g., SteyversTenenbaum 2005 ) . However, there has also been interest in exploring other linguistic levels such as morphosyntax (Ferrer-i-Canchos 2006 ) , prosody (Ferrer-i-Canchós 2008) , pragmatics (Ferrer-i-Canchis 2009) or even discourse (Ferrer-i-Canchi 2010) . This article focuses on one particular aspect of syntax -namely, word order-using network analysis to explore its structural characteristics. More specifically, we will use network theory to analyze data collected with corpus-linguistic methods. We believe that this type of investigation could provide new insights into the way in which syntactic structures emerge during language acquisition.",1,0
"We present results on distance determinations for two galaxies, NGC 3109 and WLM, based on observations made with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We have used HST/WFPC2 images taken through filters F555W and F814W to search for Cepheids among young open clusters located within these galaxies. Our survey has resulted in the discovery of four new Cepheids in NGC 3109 and one in WLM. These five Cepheids are all short-period classical pulsators with periods ranging between 4.5 days and 8.6 days. Using the period-luminosity relation derived by MadoreFreedman we find distances to NGC 3109 and W LM that agree well with previous estimates obtained using other methods.Keywords: Cepheid variables; open cluster; galaxy distance scale; Hubble Space Telescope; Araucaria Project. 1. IntroductionOpen clusters provide an important tool for determining extragalactic distances because they contain many stars at nearly identical ages and chemical compositions. In addition, open clusters can be found over a wide range of galactocentric radii, allowing us to probe different environments. However, open clusters are relatively rare objects compared to field stars or globular clusters. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct surveys covering large areas of sky in order to obtain statistically significant samples of open clusters suitable for use as calibrators of the cosmic distance ladder.The Araucaria Project was initiated in 1998 with the goal of obtaining accurate distances to nearby galaxies via measurements of Cepheid variable stars associated with open clusters. This project uses data collected primarily with the Hubble Space Telescope's WFPC2 camera. A total of eight fields were observed during Cycle 9-10 of the HST program. Each field covers about 0.25 square degrees centered around a target galaxy. For each field, deep exposures were obtained in both the F555W and F850LP bands. Details regarding this project may be found in Pietrzyński et al. (2002) and references therein.2. Searching for Cepheids Among Young Open",1,0
"We propose that the dark matter (DM) and supersymmetric particles are generated by an emergent gauge symmetry at high energy scales, which is broken down to Standard Model symmetries below TeV scale. The DM candidate can be identified as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson associated with spontaneous breaking of global U(1) symmetry. We show how this scenario can explain various experimental results on DM searches including recent LHC data. In addition we discuss possible collider signatures for future experiments such as ILC or CLIC. Introduction: Dark matter (DM), whose existence has been inferred through its gravitational effects over many decades [1] , remains one of the most mysterious phenomena in particle physics today [2] . Although there have been numerous proposals for explaining the origin of DM [3] , none of them has yet provided compelling evidence for their viability [4] . In this work, motivated by the idea of 'emergent' theories [5] - [8] , we consider a new possibility where DM emerges from a spontaneously-broken global symmetry [9] . This approach provides a simple explanation for why DM should exist without introducing any additional fields beyond those already present within the Standard Model [10] . Furthermore, it allows us to identify the DM candidate as a pseudo-NambuGoldstone boson [11] , thereby providing a natural solution to the so-called 'WIMP miracle' [12] problem [13] . Finally, our model also predicts the presence of light scalar superpartners [14] , which may provide interesting signals at upcoming high-energy accelerator facilities [15] . The rest of this article is organised as follows. In Sec. 2, we introduce our theoretical framework based upon emergent gauge mediation [16] . Then, in Secs. 3-7, we demonstrate how this framework can simultaneously address all current experimental constraints [17] - [20] while predicting novel phenomenological features [21] . Finally, in Sec. 8, we conclude with some remarks about further directions of research.",1,0
"We consider the problem of finding a shortest path between two nodes in an undirected graph with non-negative edge weights, subject to the constraint that no node can be visited more than once along this path.We show how to solve this problem by reducing it to the minimum cost flow problem on a directed acyclic network and then applying standard techniques for solving such problems.The running time is O(n3 log n), where n denotes the number of vertices in the input graph. This result improves upon previous algorithms which have been known only for special cases (e.g., when all edges are unit-weight).Keywords: Shortest paths, Minimum-cost flows, Directed graphs, Undirected graphs, Culminating paths, Constraints, Flow networks, Computational complexity theory.1 IntroductionIn many applications one needs to find a shortest path between two given nodes s and t in an undirected weighted graph G = (V , E) without allowing any vertex to appear twice or more times in the path.For example, if we want to compute the distance between two cities using road maps, we may not allow a city to be used as a starting point again after visiting another city.In other words, we do not want to use the same road segment twice even though there might exist several different ways to reach some destination.Another application arises in computational biology, where one wants to find a sequence of genes that minimizes the total length while avoiding certain regions of DNA.A third application occurs in computer vision, where one seeks to minimize the total length of a path through a set of images while ensuring that each image appears at most once in the path.Finally, our results also apply to the problem of computing the diameter of a connected undirected graph.The first algorithm for computing the shortest path satisfying these constraints was presented by Hassin and Rubinov [HR91] who showed how to reduce the problem to the minimum cost flow",1,0
"In this article, we introduce the notion of modules over an operad in any symmetric monoidal category 𝒞 with unit object I.We define the free module on a set X to be the tensor product ⊗_X× X I (where * denotes the cartesian product); it is shown that this construction satisfies all axioms for a free module except possibly associativity.The missing axiom is established by showing that the free module on two sets X,Y can be constructed as the coequalizer of certain morphisms between free modules on three sets Z_1,Z_2, Z_3 where Z_1 has one element less than X, Z_2 has one element more than Y, and Z_3 has one element less than Y∪ X.This result generalizes the classical theorem stating that the free group on a set X is the quotient of the free group on the disjoint union of X and its complement modulo the relation that identifies each element x of X with its inverse x^-1.The main results are applied to give new proofs of some well-known theorems about groups, rings, algebras, Lie algebras, and Hopf algebras.",1,0
"We study evolutionary dynamics in an ensemble of genotypes, each with its own fitness value and connected to other genotypes by mutations. We show that for large ensembles there is always one genotype which has more connections than any other genotype. This genotype dominates all others at equilibrium. The dominance of this genotype depends only on the distribution of mutational distances between pairs of genotypes. For example, if we consider two different distributions of mutational distances (the exponential and power law), then the same genotype will dominate both cases. However, the time it takes to reach equilibrium can be very different depending on how many paths lead away from the dominant genotype. In particular, when the number of paths leading away from the dominant genotype increases exponentially as a function of distance, the system reaches equilibrium much faster compared to the case where the number of paths grows slower or even remains constant.We also find that the average population size of the dominant genotype decreases slowly over time until reaching equilibrium.",1,0
"We study how popularity emerges in collective choice dynamics, where individuals sequentially choose between two options and are influenced by their peers. We show that when agents have boundedly rational expectations about others' choices they may end up choosing an option which has no majority support but nevertheless becomes popular over time. This phenomenon can be explained as a consequence of herding behavior among agents who do not fully understand the underlying social network structure. Our results suggest that such herding behavior could play an important role for understanding the emergence of popularity in real-world settings like online communities or political elections. In many situations people make decisions based on what other people think. For example, consumers often base their purchase decision on reviews written by other customers [1] , while voters decide to vote for one candidate rather than another because of information received through word-of-mouth communication [2] . Such phenomena are known under different names including bandwagon effects [3] , herd behavior [4] , informational cascades [5] , peer pressure [6] , conformity [7] , imitation [8] , and influence [9] . In this work we focus on the case where individuals' decisions are made collectively via voting [10] . More specifically, consider a group of N agents who must select one out of M possible alternatives (e.g., candidates) at each round t = 1, ..., T . At every round t ∈ [T ], agent i chooses alternative xt(i), receives feedback f (xt−1)(−i) (e.g., votes casted against his/her choice), and updates his/her belief about the state of nature θ according to Bayes' rule [11] :",1,0
"We present the design and fabrication of a novel analog electronic device, which is capable to store information in its magnetic state. The proposed system consists of two layers of ferromagnetic wires with perpendicular anisotropy (PMA) that are connected by Josephson junctions. We show how this structure can be used as an analogue associative memory. In particular we demonstrate that it allows for storing multiple patterns simultaneously and retrieving them using only one input signal. This feature makes our proposal suitable for applications where high storage density or low power consumption are required.Keywords: Analogue memory, Ferrofluids, Magnetic wire networks, PMA, Josephson junction, Pattern recognition, Associative memory. IntroductionMemory devices play a crucial role in many modern technologies such as computers, mobile phones, digital cameras etc., but their development has been mainly focused on digital memories due to their higher performance compared to conventional analog ones [1] . However, there exist several important applications where analog memories could provide significant advantages over digital counterparts [2] , e.g. pattern recognition [3] , data compression [4] , image processing [5] , bio-inspired computing [6] .In recent years, considerable efforts have been made towards developing new types of analog memories [7, 8] . Among these proposals, spintronic systems [9] offer great potential thanks to their unique properties [10] including non-volatility [11] , fast switching [12] , large integration densities [13] , compatibility with CMOS technology [14] and energy efficiency [15] . These features make spintronic devices promising candidates for future generations of nonvolatile memories [16] .Herein, we propose a novel concept of an analogue memory based on a magnetic wire network [17] . Our approach relies on the use of a ferrofluid [18] , i.e. colloidal suspension of superparamagnetic nanoparticles [19] , confined between two layers of ferromagnetic nanowires [20] . Due to the presence of the ferrofluid layer, each nanowire acquires a net magnetization [21] . As shown schematically in Fig.1(a) , when applying a bias current I b through the nanowires, they become superconducting [22]",1,0
"The reed is the key component in single-reed musical instruments, such as clarinets or saxophones. The dynamics of its motion are strongly influenced by the bore geometry and boundary conditions at both ends. In this work we present an approach to simulate the oscillations of a single reed instrument based on modal decomposition of the bore and reed dynamics. We show that it is possible to accurately reproduce the sound produced by a real clarinet using only one degree-of-freedom for each mode. This method can be used to study the influence of different parameters (such as mouthpiece diameter) on the acoustic response of the instrument without requiring expensive experimental measurements. It also allows us to investigate how changes in the design affect the performance of new prototypes.Keywords: Musical Instrument, Clarinet, Sound Generation, Modeling, Simulation, Acoustics, Vibration Analysis, Modal Analysis, Finite Element Method",1,0
"We consider the complexity class #P and its subclass #P^NP. We show that for any polynomial time computable function f : 0,1^n →0,1 there is an algorithm A such that for every input x to A it computes f(x) in time O(n^k), where k = log2|f|. This implies that if we can solve SAT in time n^k then we can compute f in time O(n^l). In particular this shows that if P != NP then #P^NP cannot be solved by deterministic algorithms running in sub-exponential time unless co-NP=PSPACE. The proof uses ideas similar to those used in proving lower bounds on the number of queries needed to solve problems like 3-SUM or Vertex Cover using dynamic programming techniques. It also relies heavily on the fact that the problem being considered has no efficient parallel solution (i.e., it does not belong to NC). Theorem 1 Let f : 0,1^m →0,1 be a polynomial-time computable function with m > 0. Then there exists an algorithm A which solves f in time O(m^k), where k = |f| .

"We present an algorithm that systematically scans all possible 7-colourings of the grid, and report on its performance in terms of running time and memory consumption. The algorithm is based on a simple backtracking scheme combined with some heuristics to prune parts of the search space. We have implemented this algorithm using Java 1.6 and tested it on several instances ranging from small grids up to large ones containing more than one million nodes. For each instance we provide detailed information about how much time was spent by our program during colouring as well as how many colours were used. In addition, we also show how these results compare against those obtained by other algorithms proposed recently in the literature.Keywords: Coloring problems, Computational complexity theory, Graphs, Backtrack search, Heuristic methods, Grid graphs, Integer programming, Optimization problems, Search trees, Time-complexity analysisINTRODUCTIONA graph G = (V, E) consists of two sets V and E where V denotes the set of vertices or nodes and E denotes the set of edges between pairs of nodes. An edge e=(u,v) connects node u ∈ V to v ∈ V . If there exists no such connection then e is not included in E. A path P is defined as a sequence of distinct nodes v1 , v2 , … , vn such that vi−1vi ∈ E for i = 2 , 3 , … , n . A cycle C is defined as a path whose first and last nodes are identical. A connected component is a subgraph H of G which has the property that any pair of nodes in H can be joined by a path within H but cannot be joined by paths outside H. A clique K is a complete subgraph of G; that is, every pair of nodes in K is adjacent to each other. A k-clique is a clique consisting of exactly k nodes. A vertex cover S is a subset of V such that every edge in G has at least one endpoint in S. A dominating set D is a subset of V",1,0
"We present an algorithm for creating a hierarchical grid spatial index using images as the basis for its construction.The algorithm is based on the observation that many real-world datasets are naturally represented by images, and can be used in conjunction with existing techniques such as R-tree or Quadtree to improve performance.We show how our technique performs against these other methods through experiments conducted over synthetic data sets generated according to different distributions (uniform, normal, exponential) and sizes ranging between 1K and 100M points.Our results demonstrate significant improvements in query response times when compared to traditional approaches. In this work we propose a new approach for building a spatial index which uses image processing algorithms to extract information about the dataset being indexed. This information is then used to build a hierarchy of grids whose leaf nodes contain pointers to individual objects within the dataset. These grids provide efficient access to all objects contained therein while also allowing fast queries across multiple grids at once.",1,0
"We present an algorithm for unicast and multicast quality-of-service (QoS) routing in the Internet using soft constraint logic programming (SCLP). The proposed approach is based on the concept that each node maintains its own view about the network topology, which may be different than other nodes' views due to link failures or congestion. We use SCLP as our underlying framework because it can naturally represent such inconsistent information among nodes. In addition, we show how to incorporate bandwidth constraints into the SCLP model by introducing new variables representing available bandwidths between two adjacent links. Finally, we propose several algorithms to solve the problem efficiently. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches significantly under various conditions.

"We present new spectroscopic observations in the near-infrared (NIR) for a sample of about 100 HII regions located along the major axis of the nearby spiral galaxy M33, at distances between 1 kpc and 8 kpc from its center. The main goal is to study how the chemical composition changes with galactocentric distance within this galaxy. We have used the NIR spectrograph ISAAC on board the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope UT1 telescope to obtain high signal-to-noise ratio spectra covering the wavelength range 0.9-2.5 microns. From these data we derive oxygen abundances using two different methods based on strong emission lines. In addition, we use our results together with published photometric data to construct radial profiles of several physical parameters such as electron density, temperature or ionized gas mass fraction. Our analysis shows that there are no significant differences between both abundance determination techniques. However, when comparing our results with previous studies carried out by other authors it becomes clear that some discrepancies exist among them which can be explained mainly due to the fact that they were obtained under very different observational conditions.",1,0
"We introduce the concept of neutral networks, which are graphs that represent relationships between sequences and shapes in an unsupervised manner. We show how these can be used for shape recognition by training them on synthetic data generated using computer graphics techniques. The resulting network is able to recognize shapes with high accuracy even when they have been transformed or distorted. Finally we demonstrate our method on real world images showing its ability to generalize well beyond the training set. In this work we present a novel approach to learning about shapes through their relationship to sequences. Our main contribution is introducing the concept of neutral networks as a way to learn such relationships without supervision. Neutral networks are graphs whose nodes correspond to sequences (e.g., strings) and edges connect similar sequences. They provide a natural representation for capturing relationships between different types of information. For example, one could use a neutral network to capture relationships between sentences and documents, or between music notes and melodies. Here we focus on applying neutral networks to the problem of recognizing shapes based solely on their sequence of points sampled along their boundary. This task has many applications including medical image analysis where it may not always be possible to obtain ground truth labels due to privacy concerns.",1,0
"We report on the fluidization of a thin, horizontally vibrating granular bed by vertical oscillations at low frequency and amplitude. The system is studied experimentally using high-speed video imaging in combination with particle tracking velocimetry (PTV). We find that for sufficiently large vibration amplitudes, particles are ejected from the surface into the air as they reach their maximum height during an upward motion. This leads to the formation of a dilute gas phase above the dense packing near the bottom of the container. In addition we observe convection rolls which transport grains across the entire depth of the bed. These results show striking similarities to those observed in vibrated beds of sand or glass beads but differ significantly from previous studies performed on systems where only horizontal vibrations were applied. Vibrations can induce transitions between different states of matter such as solids, liquids, and gases [1] . For example, it has been shown that a solid state may become unstable when subjected to periodic forcing [2] , resulting in the spontaneous generation of traveling waves [3] . A particularly interesting case occurs if both horizontal and vertical components of the driving force act simultaneously [4] . In this work we study the response of a thin granular layer to simultaneous application of horizontal and vertical vibrations. Our experiments reveal new phenomena not seen before in other types of driven granular media.",1,0
"We propose an explicit construction for a string model with gauge group SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1), three generations of quarks and leptons, right-handed neutrinos, and no exotic particles beyond those in the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM). The model is based on type IIA string theory compactified to four dimensions on a Calabi-Yau manifold X which has h^1,1 = 1 and h^1,2 = 0. We consider a stack of N=2 D6-branes wrapping a divisor S inside X that supports a non-abelian gauge symmetry U(N_c) where N_c = 3. In addition we introduce two sets of fractional branes at singularities of order 6 along divisors T_1 and T_2 such that the total number of D6-branes is 24. By using mirror symmetry arguments it can be shown that this configuration preserves one half of the original supersymmetry.",1,0
"The cosmic microwave background (CMB) is the remnant radiation left over after the Big Bang, and it provides an important test for theories about how our universe evolved.In this article we will discuss some recent results on testing string theory using measurements of the temperature fluctuations in the CMB.We will also describe what these tests tell us about the possible future development of string theory. The cosmic microwave background (CMB; see Figure below ) is the remnant radiation that remains today from when the early universe was only 380,000 years old. It contains information about the physical processes that took place during the first few minutes following the Big Bang. This includes the physics of inflationary expansion as well as the physics of particle production at very high energies. Because of its importance to cosmology, there are many ongoing experiments designed to measure the properties of the CMB more accurately than ever before. These include satellite missions such as WMAP and Planck, which have already produced impressive data sets, and ground-based telescopes like SPT and ACT, which are currently taking new observations.",1,0
"In this article, we continue the classification of finite dimensional complex filiform Leibniz algebras begun in Part 1.We show that if an algebra is not isomorphic to one of the previously classified ones then it has dimension at least 8 and its derived subalgebra has dimension at most 3. In particular, any such algebra satisfies dim(DerA) = 3 or 4. If dim(DerA)=4, then A is isomorphic either to L4(C), L1(C2), L2(C2), L3(C2), or L5(C2). If dim(DerA )=3, then A is isomorphic to one of the following Lie algebras:L6(C3), L7(C3), L8(C3), L9(C3), L10(C3), L11(C3), L12(C3), L13(C3), L14(C3), L15(C3), L16(C3), L17(C3), L18(C3), L19(C3), L20(C3), L21(C3), L22(C3), L23(C3), L24(C3), L25(C3), L26(C3), L27(C3), L28(C3), L29(C3), L30(C3), L31(C3), L32(C3), L33(C3), L34(C3), L35(C3), L36(C3), L37(C3), L38(C3), L39(C3), L40(C3), L41(C3), L42(C3), L43(C3), L44(C3), L45(C3), L46(C3), L47(C3), L48(C3), L49(C3), L50(C3), L51(C3), L52(C3), L53(C3), L54(C3), L55(C3), L56(C3), L57(C3), L58(C3), L59(C3), L60(C3), L61(C3), L62(C3), L63(C3",1,0
"We report on the detection by Swift/BAT and Konus-Wind of gamma-ray burst (GRB) 060927, which is one of only two events detected with redshifts greater than five to date.The redshift was determined using optical spectroscopy obtained with the Very Large Telescope in Chile within three hours after the burst trigger time.We find that this event has an extremely hard spectrum, similar to other high-redshift bursts observed previously.Using our current understanding of the physics behind these phenomena we can estimate the total energy released during the prompt emission phase of the burst to be10^53 erg.This value is comparable to or larger than the energies released by some supernovae.If confirmed, it would make GRB 060927 the most energetic event ever recorded.In addition, if the host galaxy mass function evolves similarly to what is seen locally, then the progenitor system responsible for producing such an energetic explosion must have been hosted by a very massive galaxy.These results are consistent with theoretical predictions made about the progenitors of high-z GRBs.Finally, we discuss how future observations of this object may help us understand the end of cosmic reionization.",1,0
"The book Nurturing Breakthroughs by James Watson and Peter Winkler is about how to create breakthroughs in science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM). The authors argue that the best way for scientists to make new discoveries is not through individual genius but rather by working together as teams on problems they are passionate about.They also claim that it helps if you have an idea of what your problem looks like before you start solving it because this will help guide your research efforts. This article describes some of their ideas and provides examples of how these concepts can be applied to physics research. In his book Nurturing Breakdowns, James Watson argues that the most successful people who solve complex problems do so by working with others instead of trying to work alone. He says that when we work individually our brains tend to focus only on one aspect of the problem at hand which may lead us down dead ends while working collaboratively allows us to see all aspects of the problem simultaneously.",1,0
"We present the results on abundance determinations for a sample of H II regions in M33, based on high resolution spectroscopy obtained with VLT/UVES and GIRAFFE spectrographs. The main goal is to study the radial distribution of oxygen abundance across this galaxy. We find that there are no significant differences between the gradients derived using different methods (T e , P method). Our best fit linear relation has slope -0.071 dex/kpc ± 0.005 dex/kpc. This value agrees well within errors with previous studies but it is slightly steeper than those found by other authors. In addition we have studied the behaviour of several α-elements as a function of galactocentric distance. We do not detect any clear trend neither for Mg nor Si or S elements. However, our data show an increase of [Ne/O] ratio towards the center of the galaxy which could be explained if Ne were produced mainly during type Ia supernovae explosions.Keywords: Chemical composition",1,0
"We study the Green function of a relativistic α-ssble process in a half-space with reflecting boundary condition at the boundary, and obtain two-sided estimates on its tail behavior by using the method of reflection principle. The results are applied to the case when the underlying space is ℝ^d or ℍ^1(ℝ). We also give an example showing that our upper bound can be strictly smaller than the lower one. Finally we prove some properties of the Green functions of relativistic α-stables processes killed upon leaving a domain. Let (X_t)_t ≥ 0 be a relativistic α-self-decomposable Lévy process (see Definition 2 below), which has been introduced independently by Bertoin [1] , Sato [2] and Watanabe [3] . It is known that this process possesses many interesting properties such as self-similarity, infinite divisibility etc. (see e.g., [4] ). In particular, it follows from [5] that there exists a constant c > 0 depending only on α such thatP[X_1 = 0] ≤ c exp( - 1/2 |x|^2 + α).",1,0
"We present new CO(2-1), 13CO(1-0), and C18O(1-0) observations with the IRAM 30m telescope towards the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 4565. The data reveal that this galaxy hosts an extended molecular disk which is warped by interactions with its companion galaxies. We find evidence for two distinct components to the molecular gas distribution; one associated with the main body of the galaxy and another component located along the southern edge of the optical disk. This second component has been previously detected as a dust lane but we show here it also contains significant amounts of molecular gas. In addition, our high resolution maps reveal a prominent central concentration of molecular gas coincident with the position of the AGN. Using these data together with previous results on other galaxies observed within the NUGA survey we investigate how the properties of the molecular gas are related to those of the stars and black holes hosted by each system.",1,0

"ZnO:Co nanocrystals were synthesized by the sol-gel method followed by annealing at different temperatures (500-700 °C). The structural, morphological, magnetic and electrical properties have been investigated in detail using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), Hall effect measurement system and UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometry techniques. XRD analysis reveals that all samples are single phase wurtzite structure without any impurity peaks. SEM images show that the particles are spherical in shape and their size increases with increasing temperature. VSM measurements reveal that the saturation magnetization decreases gradually as the annealing temperature is increased up to 700 °C due to the decrease in Co content. It was found that the resistivity shows an abrupt increase around 500 °C which indicates the occurrence of semiconductor-metal transition.",1,0
"We present BVRI surface photometry for isolated spiral galaxies in the nearby universe (0.01 < z < 0.1). The sample consists of 12 objects selected by their morphological type, inclination and apparent size to be suitable targets for detailed studies with integral field spectroscopy. We use archival data obtained at the Kitt Peak National Observatory 4m telescope as well as new observations taken during our own observing runs between 2005-2007. Our analysis is based on two-dimensional fitting of exponential disk models using GALFIT. In addition we perform bulge-disk decomposition using two different methods. First, we fit Sérsic profiles to both components simultaneously. Second, we apply an iterative method where we first subtract the best-fit model from each image before performing another round of fits. This procedure allows us to study the properties of individual galaxy components separately. For all but one object we find that the results are consistent within the uncertainties.",1,0
"We present the results of an analysis of deep Chandra X-ray Observatory observations of two high redshift galaxies, MS1512-cB58 and APM 08279+5255 (z = 3.91). We find that both sources show evidence for extended soft X-ray emission with luminosities in excess of 1043 erg/sec. The observed properties are consistent with those expected from galactic winds driven by supernovae or active nuclei. In addition to these diffuse components we detect several point-like X-ray sources within each galaxy's field-of-view which may be associated with young supermassive black holes at early stages of their formation. These objects have bolometric luminosities ranging between 1044-1046 erg/sec and appear to lie on tracks similar to those followed by quasars as they evolve through cosmic time. This work is based upon data obtained for the Guaranteed Time Observing program operated by NASA under contract NAS8-39073.",1,0
"We study the gauge structure of quantum spin systems with local interactions, which are described by the so-called Kitaev model. We show that this model is equivalent to an exactly solvable lattice gauge theory (LGT) whose action functional is given by the Chern-Simons term. The equivalence between these two theories allows us to use powerful techniques developed for LGTs such as the index theorem or the localization technique. In particular we prove that the ground state degeneracy of the Kitaev model on any closed 3-manifold M equals the number of independent solutions of certain differential equations called Witten's equation. This result can be viewed as a generalization of the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem to manifolds with boundary. Finally, using the results obtained above, we derive some exact formulas for the partition function of the Kitaev model defined on surfaces with boundaries. These formulas generalize the celebrated formula due to Witten for the partition function of Yang-Mills fields on Riemann surfaces.",1,0
"We present an analysis of morphological properties for a sample of luminous compact galaxies (LCGs) selected in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field and studied with the Advanced Camera for Surveys on board the Hubble Space Telescope. We use GALFIT to fit single Sérsic profiles to all objects, allowing us to derive their structural parameters such as effective radius Re, Sérsic index n, axis ratio q, position angle PA, total magnitude mT , and half-light surface brightness SB e . The results show that most of these galaxies are bulge-dominated systems with high central concentration indices (n > 2). In addition, we find that there is no significant correlation between galaxy luminosity or size and its Sérsic index. Finally, by comparing our results with those obtained for other samples of massive early-type galaxies at different redshifts, we conclude that LCGs have similar sizes but higher concentrations than local elliptical galaxies.",1,0
"We propose an algorithm for reconstructing the signaling network in which each node is associated with multiple time series data, and we assume that only some nodes are observed at any given time point. The proposed method consists of two steps: (1) estimating the state vector by solving a sparse reconstruction problem; (2) inferring the edge set using the estimated states as features. We show through numerical experiments on synthetic networks that our approach can accurately recover both the structure and parameters of the underlying network even when only partial information about the system is available. Our results also suggest that the performance of the proposed method depends strongly on how well the sparsity pattern of the true signal is captured by the observation matrix. Finally, we apply this method to analyze the dynamics of protein phosphorylation in yeast cells responding to heat shock stress. In particular, we identify several key proteins involved in regulating the response process. This work was supported by NIH grant R01GM084283-01A1",1,0
"We consider a spherically symmetric solution to Einstein's equations in five dimensions with an extra dimension compactified on S 1 /Z 2 . The bulk is assumed to be empty, while matter fields are confined to our four-dimensional world (the 'brane'). We find that this model can explain the observed flatness of galactic rotation curves without introducing any new particles or exotic forms of energy density. In particular we show how the mass distribution within galaxies may arise naturally as a consequence of the geometry of space-time. This work was supported by NSF grant PHY-0456728. PACS numbers: 04.20.-q, 11.10.-z, 98.80.CqA fundamental question about the nature of dark matter has been whether it consists of one or more species of particle. If so, what are their masses? What interactions do they have with ordinary matter? How much dark matter does each galaxy contain? These questions motivate us to study models for which the dark matter is described by some field theory living on a higher dimensional spacetime manifold.Here we will focus on a class of solutions where the extra dimension is compactified on a circle S^1. Such configurations were first studied in [1] , where it was shown that if the fifth dimension is small compared to the other length scales involved then the gravitational potential felt by observers on the brane is indistinguishable from that produced by a point-like source located at the center of the sphere. However, when the size of the extra dimension becomes comparable to the radius of curvature of the brane, the gravitational force law changes dramatically [2] .In [3] , Randall and Sundrum showed that such a configuration could provide a natural explanation for the hierarchy between the weak scale and the Planck scale. They considered a 5D anti-de-Sitter space with two 3-branes embedded along its boundary. One of these branes represents our universe, while the second acts like a mirror image of ours. Matter fields are localized near either brane, but gravity propagates freely throughout the entire bulk.",1,0
"The purpose of this study is to examine the role that evaluation plays in communication between teachers and students during computer-based learning environments (CBLE). The research question guiding this investigation is: How does evaluation affect student-teacher interaction? This study was conducted with two groups of undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory course on educational technology at a large Midwestern university. Students were asked to complete three tasks using a CBLE called WebQuests, which are designed for use by students working individually or collaboratively. Data collection included audio recordings of group discussions, field notes taken by researchers observing each group's work, and students' written responses to questions posed throughout their participation in the project. Analysis revealed that evaluation played several roles within these interactions including providing feedback about individual performance; clarifying expectations; establishing ground rules; and promoting reflection. These findings suggest that evaluation can be used effectively to enhance student-teacher communication when it occurs frequently enough over time so that both parties have multiple opportunities to respond to one another.",1,0
"We study the statistical properties of Barkhausen noise generated by an Ising spin system with random fields and competing interactions at its surface, using wavelets to analyze the time series produced by this model.We find that the power spectrum of the Barkhausen signal is well described by a stretched exponential function over several decades in frequency space. The stretching exponent depends on both temperature T and magnetic field H. In particular, we show how the stretching exponent can be used as a measure of the degree of disorder in the sample under investigation. Finally, we discuss possible extensions of our work to other types of systems exhibiting avalanche dynamics. Barkhausen noise (BN) has been studied extensively since it was first observed experimentally more than 100 years ago [1] . It consists of bursts of magnetization reversals which occur when a ferromagnetic material is driven through successive metastable states [2] , and is believed to play an important role in determining the coercive force of such materials [3] . The statistics of BN have attracted considerable interest recently [4] - [8] due to their potential application in non-destructive testing [9] . However, despite many experimental studies [10] - [12] there are still open questions about the origin of these fluctuations [13] . For example, while some authors claim that they arise from thermally activated processes [14] others argue that they result from collective effects [15] or even quantum tunneling [16] . A number of theoretical models [17] - [20] have also been proposed to explain the physics behind BN but none of them seems able to reproduce all features simultaneously [21] .",1,0
"We present Spitzer mid-infrared spectroscopy for a sample of infrared luminous galaxies (LIRGs) and ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). The sample is drawn from the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey-North field, which has been observed with both IRAC and MIPS on board Spitzer Space Telescope as part of the GOODS survey program. We use these data to study the physical properties of dusty starbursts in distant galaxies by comparing their rest-frame 5-15 micron spectra against those of local ULIRGs. Our results show that most of our targets are dominated by PAH emission features similar to those seen in nearby ULIRGs. However, we also find some differences between high-z sources and local ULIRGs: 1) Most of the high-redshift objects have weaker silicate absorption feature than local ULIRGs do; 2) High-redshift sources tend to be more compact than local ULIRGS; 3) Some of them may contain an AGN component based on the detection of broad Hα lines or strong continuum emission shortward of 9.7 um.",1,0
"We have searched for radio transients with flux densities between 0.1 and 1 mJy at frequencies ranging from 4 to 8 GHz using archival data obtained by the Very Large Array (VLA) over the past 20 years. We find that most of these sources are extragalactic, but we also detect several Galactic objects including pulsars, supernova remnants, and flare stars. The majority of our sample is comprised of previously uncatalogued sources; however, we recover many known variable sources such as blazars and gamma-ray burst afterglows. Our results demonstrate the power of combining large amounts of archival VLA data into one coherent dataset. This work was supported by NSF grant AST-0907860. In this Letter, we present an analysis of all available archived Very Large Array (V LA) observations taken since 1990. These data were collected during various observing programs aimed primarily at studying distant galaxies or nearby star forming regions. However, they contain valuable information about fainter transient phenomena occurring within our Galaxy. By searching through more than 10 000 hours of observation time spread across nearly 2000 epochs, we identify thousands of new faint radio sources which appear only once or twice in each epoch's data set. Most of these sources are extragalaxtic, but we also detect numerous Galactic objects including pulsar wind nebulae, supernova remnants, flare stars, and other types of active galactic nuclei. Many of these newly discovered sources are not included in existing catalogs because their low signal-to-noise ratio makes them difficult to detect when observed individually. However, by combining multiple epochs together, we can boost the sensitivity of our survey enough to detect even very weak signals.",1,0
"We study the clustering coefficients of protein-protein interaction networks (PPINs) and their relationship with network topological properties, such as degree distribution and average path length. We find that PPINs have higher clustering coefficients than random graphs with similar degrees or scale-free networks generated by Barabasi-Albert model. The high clustering coefficient is mainly due to the existence of many triangles in these networks. In addition, we show that the clustering coefficients are correlated positively with the number of proteins but negatively with the number of interactions per protein. These results suggest that there may be some common mechanisms underlying the formation of both triangles and edges between two nodes with large degrees. Finally, we propose an algorithm for identifying functional modules based on local clustering analysis. Our method can identify clusters with different sizes and shapes. Clustering coefficients of protein-protein interactomes are studied. It is found that they are significantly larger than those of random graphs with same degree distributions or scale-free networks generated using Barabasi-Albert preferential attachment rule. High clustering coefficients are mainly caused by the presence of many triangles in these systems. Correlations between clustering coefficients and other topological parameters are also investigated. An algorithm for finding functional modules based on local cluster analysis is proposed.",1,0
"The Gemini Deep Planet Survey (GDPS) is an ongoing survey for transiting planets around bright stars using the twin 8-meter telescopes at Gemini Observatory in Hawaii and Chile.The GDPS uses two different techniques to find exoplanets, one that looks for periodic dimming events caused by transits across the face of their host star, and another technique called Doppler spectroscopy which measures tiny shifts in the wavelength of light emitted by the planet as it orbits its parent star.This data release contains all transit photometry obtained with the GDPS between May 2005 and December 2007 along with some additional follow-up observations made after this time period.These data are available on the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia website at:  .This data set includes more than 1 million individual measurements taken over nearly 1000 nights of observation.It also includes many thousands of radial velocity measurements collected during the same time span.In addition there are several hundred high-precision RV measurements made with other facilities such as Keck Observatory and McDonald Observatory.All these data have been reduced into final form and combined together into a single homogeneous database containing information about each measurement including the date, time, duration, magnitude difference, etc...",1,0
"We present the results of our numerical simulations of magnetorotational collapse (MRC) in primordial stars with initial masses between 100 and 1000 M⊙, which are formed at redshifts z = 20 − 30. We find that for all models considered here, magnetic fields play an important role during the formation process of black holes. The final mass of the central object is determined by the strength of the magnetic field. For weak magnetic fields (B < 10^10 G), we obtain stellar-mass black holes; while for stronger fields (B > 10^10G), supermassive black holes form. In addition to this effect on the final mass, magnetic fields also affect the angular momentum distribution inside the collapsing star. This leads to different spin parameters of the resulting black hole depending on its progenitor's initial mass.Keywords: Black Hole, Primordial Star Formation, Magnetohydrodynamics",1,0
"We study the complexity of model checking higher-order fixpoint logic (HFL) over finite Kripke structures, which is an extension of propositional modal logic with fixpoints and quantification over state variables ranging over infinite domains. We show that HFL satisfiability can be reduced to the problem of deciding whether there exists a solution for a system of linear equations in rational numbers whose coefficients are given by polynomials over integers. This reduction allows us to obtain lower bounds on the computational complexity of HFL satisfiability using known results about solving systems of polynomial equations. In particular, we prove PSPACE-hardness of HFL satisfiability when the number of fixpoint operators occurring in the formula is unbounded or restricted only to existential ones. On the other hand, we provide a simple algorithm for HFL satisfiability based on computing least solutions of certain systems of integer quadratic equations. The running time of this algorithm depends exponentially on the maximum degree of these equations but it does not depend on the number of fixpoint",1,0

"We study the relaxation behavior in the Random Energy Model (REM) with an external magnetic field, which is one of the simplest models to describe glassy phenomena. We show that the relaxation time distribution function has a universal form independent of temperature and system size by using numerical simulations on finite-dimensional systems up to dimension d = 8. The universality holds even when we take into account the effect of quenched disorder. This result suggests that the relaxation process in this model can be described as a superposition of many processes each of which obeys the same scaling law. In addition, we find that the relaxation time distribution functions at different temperatures are well fitted by a stretched exponential function. These results suggest that the relaxation process in our model is governed by a broad spectrum of relaxation times. Introduction:-The Random Energy Model(REM), proposed by Derrida [1] ,is one of the simplest models describing glassy phenomena [2] .In this model,the energy landscape consists of N local minima whose energies are randomly distributed according to some probability density P(E).Each minimum corresponds to a metastable state and its lifetime τi is determined by the Arrhenius law exp[−Ei/kBT ] where Ei denotes the activation energy barrier between two neighboring states i and j.It was shown numerically [3] that the relaxation time distribution follows a power-law decaying function f (τ ) ∝ 1/τ 1+α with α ≈ 1.3 − 2 depending on the dimensionality of the system [4] . Recently it was found [5] that the relaxation time distribution also follows a power-law decay if we consider the case without any quenched disorder but with a random initial condition instead.This indicates that the relaxation process in the REM is dominated by activated events over barriers separating different metastable states [6] .However,it should be noted that these studies were performed only for low dimensions such as d ≤ 4 [7, 8] .Therefore,in order to understand the nature of glassy phenomena more clearly,we need to investigate whether or not the above mentioned results hold true in higher dimensions.",1,0
"We report on XMM-Newton and Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO) observations of the recently discovered high-energy gamma-ray source, TeV J2032+4131. The data show that this object is an active galactic nucleus with a power-law spectrum extending to at least 100 keV. We find no evidence for absorption by intervening material in excess of Galactic values along its line-of-sight. A comparison between our results and those obtained using other instruments suggests that there may be significant variability in both the flux density and spectral index of TeV J2032 + 4131 over timescales as short as one day. This would imply either rapid changes in intrinsic emission or strong Doppler boosting effects due to relativistic motion of the emitting region.Keywords: Active galactic nuclei, Gamma rays, Variability, X-rays, High energy astrophysics1. IntroductionIn recent years, several new classes of high energy sources have been identified through their detection at very-high energies (E > 10 GeV). These include blazars, radio galaxies, pulsar wind nebulae, supernova remnants, starburst galaxies, galaxy clusters, and possibly even some nearby stars [1] . However, many of these objects are still poorly understood because they lack counterparts at lower frequencies where most of the relevant physical processes occur [2] .In particular, it has proven difficult to identify the origin of the highest energy photons detected so far [3] , which can reach energies up to 1020 eV [4] . One possible explanation is that such photons are produced during interactions involving extremely energetic particles accelerated within compact regions close to supermassive black holes [5] . Alternatively, they could result from decays of neutral pions created when cosmic ray protons interact with ambient matter [6] . If confirmed, such events would provide important insights into particle acceleration mechanisms near black holes [7, 8] .Recently, the HESS collaboration reported the discovery of a bright point-like gammaray source located at RA = 20 h 32 m 41 s ± 5′′ and Dec = +39°30′00",1,0
"In this work, we propose an energy-efficient cooperative transmission scheme for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The proposed scheme is based on the combination of collaborative beamforming at the source node with cooperative transmission to multiple relay nodes in order to improve lifetime performance. In particular, the source node first transmits data packets using its maximum power level. Then, it switches to lower power levels if no packet has been successfully received within a certain time period. If one or more packets are successfully decoded, then the source node increases its transmit power back up to the previous value. We derive closed-form expressions for outage probability as well as average throughput under Rayleigh fading channels. Our results show that our proposed scheme can significantly increase network lifetime compared to conventional schemes without compromising system reliability. Finally, numerical examples are provided to verify the theoretical analysis. Keywords: Lifetime improvement; Relay selection; Energy efficiency; Outage probability",1,0
"In this work, we propose an evolutionary neural gas model for input categorization and clustering in the context of self-organizing networks. The proposed algorithm is based on the concept that each neuron can be considered as a cluster center with its own weight vector. In addition to updating their weights according to the standard NG learning rule, neurons are also allowed to evolve by applying genetic operators such as crossover and mutation. We show through experiments conducted on benchmark data sets that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms including SOMs, GNGs, and EBGs. Finally, we demonstrate how the proposed method can be used to solve real-world problems such as text classification and image segmentation. Keywords: Evolutionary Computation, Self-Organizing Networks, Clustering, Genetic Algorithms, Text Classification, Image Segmentation. 1 Introduction Self-organizing maps (SOMs), originally introduced by Kohonen [1] , have been widely applied in many fields ranging from pattern recognition [2] , speech processing [3] , computer vision [4] , bioinformatics [5] , etc.. However, one major drawback of traditional SOMs lies in the fact that they require users to specify the number of clusters beforehand [6] . To overcome this problem, several extensions of SOMs were developed [7, 8] . Among these extensions, growing neural gas (GNG) [9] has attracted much attention due to its ability to automatically determine the optimal number of clusters during training [10] . Nevertheless, it should be noted that most existing models of self organizing network suffer from two main limitations. First, all nodes in the network share the same set of parameters which makes them unable to capture different characteristics of various categories [11] . Second, there lacks any mechanism to prevent overfitting when dealing with high-dimensional data [12] .",1,0
"We present the results on the decay amplitudes for B -> D pi decays in the framework of QCD factorization approach, including both perturbative corrections at one-loop level and nonperturbative contributions from light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) of pion and kaon. We find that the branching ratios are sensitive to the values of LCDAs parameters. The direct CP asymmetries depend strongly on the relative phase between penguin and tree diagrams. Our numerical results show that the theoretical predictions agree well with experimental data within errors.IntroductionIn recent years there has been great progresses made in understanding heavy flavor physics through experiments performed by BaBar [1] , Belle [2] , CLEO [3] and LHCb [4] Collaborations. Many interesting phenomena have been observed such as large CP violation effects in B mesons [5] . It is therefore important to study these processes theoretically so as to understand their underlying dynamics better. Among them, B → DPi decays play an essential role since they can be used to extract information about CKM matrix elements Vub and Vtd [6] .In this work we will calculate the decay amplitudes for B→DPi decays using the method of QCD factorization [7, 8] which was first proposed by Beneke et al [9] . This method takes into account all possible Feynman graphs contributing to the process under consideration and then separates out soft divergences appearing in loop integrals into universal functions called light cone distribution amplitudes(LCDA). These LCDA's contain only non-perturbative information and can be calculated either by lattice simulations or extracted from experiment [10] . After separating out the soft divergences, hard scattering kernels containing collinear singularities remain and need to be evaluated order-by-order in perturbation theory [11] .Theoretical FrameworkB→DPi Decay Amplitudes In the rest frame of B-meson, the differential decay widths for B→DPi can be written as:",1,0
"G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are one of the largest families of cell surface proteins and play an important role in many physiological processes, including vision, olfaction, taste, hormone secretion, neurotransmission, immune response, inflammation, and cancer.The number of known human GPCR sequences has increased dramatically over recent years due to advances in genome sequencing technologies; however, only about half have been functionally characterized so far. In this study we present a novel computational method that can be used to predict the functional class of uncharacterized GPCRs based on their sequence similarity with other members within each subfamily. Our approach is based on two key ideas: 1) We use a new adaptive strategy to select representative sequences from different subfamilies by considering both the diversity among them as well as their evolutionary relationships; 2) We develop a new scoring scheme which takes into account not only the pairwise sequence similarities but also the structural information between query and template sequences. Using our method, we were able to successfully classify more than 80",1,0
"We present optical spectroscopic observations for the sample of 14 extreme high energy peaked BL Lac objects (EHBLs) selected by Costamante et al. (2013) . The main goal is to study their host galaxy properties and investigate possible differences with respect to lower-energy blazars, which are known to be hosted in elliptical galaxies. We find that all EHBLs have redshifts between 0.1 and 1.0, consistent with previous results on this class of sources. All but one source show evidence of being hosted in spiral or irregular galaxies; only PKS 0537-441 shows an elliptical-like spectrum. This result suggests that there may not exist any significant difference in the hosts of low-and high-energy blazars as previously claimed. However, we note that our sample size is small and further studies will be needed before drawing firm conclusions.Keywords: Blazar, Host Galaxy",1,0
"We present optical BVRI imaging, near-infrared JHKs photometry, and radio continuum observations at 1.4 GHz for the dwarf irregular galaxy ESO 364-G 029 (UGC 6456). The new data are combined with existing Hα spectroscopy to study its star formation history over the past few hundred million years. We find that this galaxy has experienced several bursts of intense star formation in recent times, which have produced large amounts of ionized gas visible as bright knots of emission across most of the face-on disk. These knots appear to be associated with young massive stars formed during each episode of star formation. In addition, we detect an extended component of diffuse ionized gas surrounding these knots. This is likely due to photoionization by hot evolved stars or supernovae remnants. Using our deepest images taken under good seeing conditions, we measure a total stellar mass of M = 2.1 × 10^7 M_sol within a radius of 5 kpc.",1,0
"We have studied the pulse-to-pulse intensity variations in two pulsars, PSR B0826-34 and PSR B1133+16, using data obtained with the Parkes radio telescope at 1.4 GHz (92cm) and 2.7GHz(36cm). We find that both pulsars show strong evidence for subpulse drift bands which are modulated by an underlying pattern of weaker emission. The observed patterns can be explained as due to interference between different modes of emission within each beam. In addition we find that there is no significant difference in the subpulse modulation properties when comparing observations made at 36cm and those made at 92cm. This suggests that the physical processes responsible for producing these phenomena operate over a wide range of frequencies. These results provide further support for the idea that the phenomenon known as drifting subpulses may arise through some form of plasma instability operating on the open field lines near the magnetic poles of neutron stars.Keywords: Pulsar",1,0
"We present an argument for why quantum mechanics is nonlocal, based on the fact that it allows one to predict with certainty whether or not a measurement will be made in any given experiment. We show how this can lead to superluminal communication between two parties sharing entangled particles by using only local operations and classical communication (LOCC). Finally we generalize the Born rule to allow for arbitrary measurements instead of just von Neumann ones. The usual formulation of quantum mechanics assumes that all experiments are performed under ideal conditions where no errors occur during the preparation of states or the execution of measurements. However, in practice there always exist some experimental imperfections such as decoherence due to environmental noise, imprecision in state preparations, and inaccuracy in measurements. In order to account for these effects, several approaches have been proposed including stochastic Schrödinger equations [1] , open systems [2] , and generalized probabilistic theories [3] . Here we consider another approach known as Quantum Bayesianism [4] . In Quantum Bayesianism, the wave function is regarded as representing our knowledge about the system rather than describing its physical properties. This means that when performing a measurement, the outcome is determined by updating our knowledge according to Bayes' theorem [5] . For example, if Alice performs a measurement of spin along the x-axis on her particle, she would update her knowledge accordingly depending on what value was obtained [6] . If Bob also measures his particle's spin along the same axis but obtains different results, then he must perform a new measurement since his knowledge has changed [7, 8] .",1,0
"We present new results on the timing and lensing properties of two colliding galaxy clusters, Abell 520 (z = 0.2) and Abell 521 (z = 0.3). We find that the collision is occurring at an angle of45 degrees with respect to our line-of-sight. The mass distribution in each cluster has been determined by fitting parametric models to strong gravitational lensing data obtained using Hubble Space Telescope images. Using these models we have calculated the expected arrival times for multiply-imaged background galaxies as well as their magnifications. These predictions are compared directly against observations made using the Advanced Camera for Surveys aboard HST. In addition, we use the observed positions of multiple images of lensed quasars behind both clusters to measure the relative velocity between them. Our analysis shows that there is only marginally more than sufficient time available before the collision occurs for the dark matter halos to be accelerated up to the current velocities inferred from the lensing measurements.",1,0
"The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of novel antimicrobial cyclic peptides, named microbe-derived cationic ring structures (MCRs), on cell proliferation and apoptosis induction in A549 non-small-cell lung carcinoma cells. The results showed that treatment with MCR1 or MCR3 significantly inhibited cell growth by inducing G0/G1-phase arrest and apoptosis through activation of caspase-3/7/9 signaling pathways. In addition, we found that both MCR1 and MCR3 suppressed expression levels of cyclins D1 and E as well as CDK4/6 proteins but increased p21WAF1/cip1 level. Furthermore, our data indicated that MCR1 and MRC3 blocked the binding between insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) and retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (RB). These findings suggest that MCR1 and 3 may be potential therapeutic agents for treating lung cancers.",1,0
"We present results on the infrared (IR) properties of galaxies obtained by comparing predictions made using a semi-analytic galaxy formation model to observations taken as part of the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS). We find that our model reproduces many observed trends, including the IR luminosity function and the correlation between star formation rate and dust temperature. However, we also identify some discrepancies which suggest that further work is needed before this type of modelling can be used for detailed studies of individual objects or small samples. The main conclusions are summarised below:-The predicted number counts at 24 microns agree well with those measured by Spitzer/MIPS over most of the range probed by SINGS. -Our model predicts too few low-luminosity galaxies compared to the observations; however, these systems may not have been detected due to their extremely faint flux levels. -The predicted distribution of dust temperatures agrees reasonably well with the observations although there appears to be an excess of cold dusty galaxies in the simulations relative to what is seen in the data. -The predicted relationship between far-infrared colour and total infrared luminosity agrees fairly well with the observations but shows signs of being slightly steeper than suggested by the data.",1,0
"We study the escape dynamics of an elastic string in two dimensions confined by a potential well with periodic boundary conditions and subject to thermal noise. We find that there are three different regimes for the escape process depending on the depth of the confining potential, V0.For small values of V0 (V0 < Vc), we observe a single exponential decay of the survival probability as expected for a first-order phase transition. In this regime, the mean lifetime decreases exponentially with increasing temperature T . For intermediate values of V0 ( Vc < V0 < Vs ), we observe a double-exponential decay of the survival probability indicating a second-order phase transition. The mean lifetime increases linearly with decreasing temperature below Tc , where Tc is the critical temperature at which the system undergoes a continuous phase transition into the metastable state. Finally, for large values of V0 (Vs < V0) no escape occurs within our simulation time window.",1,0
"We present results on the MiniBooNE experiment, which has recently reported an excess in electron neutrino appearance events at low energies (E < 100 MeV). We show that this excess can be explained by adding two light sterile neutrinos to the Standard Model. The new states are required to have masses below 2× 10^-3 eV/c2 and mix strongly into the active neutrino flavors. In addition we find that there is no need for additional CP violation beyond what is already predicted within the Standard Model.

"We study the problem of finding an optimal set of points on the unit circle that are equidistant to each other and have minimum angular separation between them, known as the Costas array or Costas configuration.We show how this problem can be formulated as a convex optimization problem with linear constraints over the space of probability measures supported by the unit circle. This formulation allows us to use tools from convex analysis for solving it efficiently. In particular we provide a polynomial time algorithm which computes an approximate solution within any desired accuracy. The proposed method is based on the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm combined with the Sinkhorn-Knopp scaling technique. Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of our approach compared to existing methods.

"We report on the discovery and timing analysis of pulsar PSR J1852 + 0040, which is associated with supernova remnant (SNR) Kes 79. The pulsar has spin period P = 1.56 ms and characteristic age τc = 3 kyrs. We find that its surface magnetic field strength Bs = 2 × 10^10 G, assuming an inclination angle i = 60 degrees between the rotation axis and line-of-sight to Earth. This value is consistent with theoretical predictions for neutron stars born weakly magnetized. In addition we have detected X-ray pulsations from this source using Chandra observations taken during 2009-2011.

"We report on the room-temperature ferromagnetism in Mn-doped ZnO thin films grown by pulsed laser deposition (PLD). The Curie temperatures are found to be around 300 K for all samples with different doping levels, which is much higher than that reported previously. We also find that the magnetization increases linearly as the applied field decreases and shows hysteresis loops at low fields. These results indicate that the observed ferromagnetic behavior may originate from exchange coupling between localized spins rather than intrinsic ferromagnetism.In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing new materials for spintronic applications such as nonvolatile memory devices or logic circuits based on the manipulation of electron spins instead of charge carriers1-5 . Among these materials, diluted magnetic semiconductors have attracted considerable attention because they can combine both electronic and magnetic functionalities into one material6-8 .ZnO-based DMSs have been extensively studied due to their wide band gap energy (3.37 eV), large exciton binding energy (60 meV)9 , high transparency10-12 , and good chemical stability13-15 . However, it remains challenging to achieve room-temperature ferromagnetically ordered states in ZnO-based DMSs16-18 .

"We present the kinematics and physical properties of strong Mg II absorbers at z = 1.5 − 3, using high-resolution (R ≈ 45000) spectroscopy obtained with Keck/HIRES. We find that these systems are composed primarily of cool gas clouds in pressure equilibrium with their surroundings; they have typical sizes of 100-200 pc, masses of 10^6−10^7 M_sun, and temperatures of10 4 K. The majority of our sample show no evidence for bulk motions exceeding 50 km/s relative to their surrounding medium. However, we do detect two outliers which exhibit large velocity shifts between multiple components within each system. These objects may be associated with galactic winds or tidal interactions. Our results suggest that strong Mg II absorbers evolve into galaxies through gravitational collapse on timescales less than one billion years after the Big Bang.

"The Generator Coordinate Method (GCM) is an efficient approach to calculate the electronic structure and properties of materials with strong electron-phonon coupling, such as polar semiconductors or insulators. In this work we present a new implementation of GCM within Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT), which allows us to study phonon-assisted optical excitations on large systems. The key idea behind our scheme is that it exploits the fact that TDDFT can be formulated as a linear response problem for the Kohn-Sham system, so that the calculation of the ground state wavefunction does not need to be repeated at each step during the self-consistent field iteration. We demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm by calculating the absorption spectrum of bulk silicon under hydrostatic pressure up to 100 GPa. Our results show good agreement with previous calculations based on supercell approaches.",1,0
"The fitting problem is one of the most important problems in cosmology, which has been studied for more than 50 years.The main goal of this work was to study the effect of different types of initial conditions on the evolution of density perturbations in an expanding universe with a positive cosmological constant (dark energy).We have used two methods to solve numerically the Einstein equations coupled to the matter fields:the standard method based on the expansion of the metric tensor into spherical harmonics; and the new method developed by us that uses the expansion of the metric into Chebyshev polynomials.In both cases we have considered three types of initial conditions: Gaussian random fields generated using the Zel'dovich approximation, Gaussian random fields generated using a fast Fourier transform algorithm, and white noise.Our results show that all these models give similar predictions at late times when they are evolved up to z = 0.5.However, there are some differences between them at early times.These differences can be explained as follows:the Zel'dovich model predicts larger fluctuations compared to other models because it does not take into account the pressure term in the fluid equation; the white noise model gives smaller fluctuations due to its statistical properties; finally, the Gaussian random fields obtained via the fast Fourier transform algorithm predict intermediate values.This result shows that the choice of the initial conditions may affect significantly the final value of the power spectrum of primordial density fluctuations predicted by inflationary theories.",1,0
"In this talk, we will discuss the relationship between the Thurston norm and normal surfaces in 3-manifolds.We will begin by recalling some basic definitions about the Thurston norm on homology classes of surface bundles over circles (or equivalently, mapping tori).Then, using techniques developed by Gabai, we will show that any class with positive Thurston norm can be represented by an embedded surface which is incompressible and not boundary-parallel.Finally, we will give examples to illustrate how these results are used to study the topology of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. The Thurston norm was introduced in 1982 as part of the solution to the Geometrization Conjecture for Haken manifolds.It assigns each element of H_1(M;ℝ) a non-negative real number, where M is a closed orientable 3-manifold.This assignment satisfies certain natural properties, including additivity under connected sums and multiplicativity under finite covers.In particular, if M_1 and M_2 are two closed orientable 3-manfolds whose fundamental groups have isomorphic subgroups of finite index, then there exists a constant C > 0 such that ||[ϕ]||_Th = C ||[ψ]||_Th whenever ϕ : π_1 M_1 →π_1 M_2 ≅ H_3 is a homomorphism inducing isomorphism on all subgroups of finite index.If μ∈ H_1(M;ℝ;ℤ) represents a fibered knot or link in a closed oriented 3-manifold, then its Thurston norm measures the complexity of the associated fibration.For example, if L ⊆ M is a fibered torus knot or link, then ||μ||_Th = 1 if and only if L bounds a Seifert surface in M.On the other hand, if L does not bound a Seifert surface in...",1,0
"We have performed neutron powder diffraction experiments on the intermetallic compound Sm2IrIn8 in order to determine its magnetic structure and compare it with that proposed for YbMgGaO4, another member of this family of compounds. The results show that Sm2IrIn8 has an antiferromagnetic ordering at TN = 3.5 K with moments aligned along the c-axis. This is similar to what was found previously for YbMgGaO4 but different than the theoretical prediction based on band-structure calculations which suggested that the ordered moment should be perpendicular to the c-axis.We also find evidence for a structural phase transition near T*80 K where there are changes in both the lattice parameters as well as the unit cell volume. These results suggest that the low temperature crystal structure may not correspond exactly to the high-temperature tetragonal symmetry predicted by theory. Finally we present specific heat data showing clear anomalies associated with both the magnetic ordering and the structural phase transition.",1,0
"We study the possibility that leptons acquire their masses through an effective dimension-5 operator, which is suppressed by some heavy scale M . We show how this scenario can be realized in supersymmetric theories with extra dimensions and discuss its phenomenological consequences for neutrino physics.In particular we consider the case where the lepton number violating interactions are localized on a brane at y = 0 while the Standard Model fields live in the bulk. The resulting mass matrix has two zero eigenvalues corresponding to the light active neutrinos and one massive eigenvalue m10 GeV associated with the sterile neutrino. This leads to interesting predictions for neutrinoless double beta decay as well as for cosmology. For example, if the Majorana phase vanishes then there will be no contribution to neutrinoless double-beta decay but the sterile neutrino may still contribute significantly to dark matter production during inflation or reheating.",1,0
"We consider the effective inverse spectral problems (EISP) associated with rational Lax matrices, which are generalizations of classical EISP in terms of Jacobi matrices. We show that these new EISPs can be reduced to some special cases of classical EISP by using an explicit formula for the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of a rational matrix. As examples we study two classes of rational Lax matrices: one is related to the Toda lattice hierarchy and another is connected with the modified Volterra lattice hierarchy. In particular, we give a complete description on all solutions of the corresponding EISPs. Finally, as applications of our results, we present several interesting properties about the spectra of these rational Lax matrices. The research was supported by NSFC under Grant No.11571040.

"We present new observations of molecular hydrogen (H_2CO) absorption toward the low-mass protostar IRAS 16293-2422, which is associated with two outflows driven by different components of this binary system. The main component drives an east-west bipolar flow that has been traced over more than 1000 AU using SiO emission lines observed at high angular resolution. We have detected anomalously strong absorption features near the systemic velocity of the source for both ortho- and para-H_2CO transitions. These are likely due to self-absorption within the dense gas surrounding the central protostars. In addition, we find evidence for blueshifted absorption features in the para-H_2CO line profiles that may be tracing infalling material along the axis of one of the outflow lobes. Finally, we compare our results with previous studies of carbon monoxide (CO) emission towards the same region.",1,0

"We study the possibility that electroweak symmetry breaking is triggered by strong dynamics at an ultraviolet (UV) fixed point, as suggested by gauge-Higgs unification models with warped extra dimensions. We show how this scenario can be realized within the framework of composite Higgs models based on strongly-coupled gauge theories. In particular we consider two different realizations of such scenarios: one where the Higgs arises as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson associated to spontaneous breaking of approximate global symmetries; another where it emerges as a bound state of new fermions charged under the Standard Model gauge group. The latter case leads to novel signatures for Higgs production through gluon fusion which are potentially observable at future colliders. Finally, we discuss possible implications of these results for cosmology. Gauge-Higgs unification provides a compelling explanation for why the weak scale is so much smaller than any other mass scale in nature [1] . It also offers a natural solution to the hierarchy problem between the Planck and TeV scales [2] , since quantum corrections to the Higgs potential are cut off at the UV scale [3] . In order to realize this idea in practice, however, several challenges must be overcome [4] : i) the Higgs should arise naturally out of some strongly coupled sector; ii) the Higgs couplings to SM particles should agree with experiment; iii) there should exist a mechanism to generate masses for all SM fields without introducing large hierarchies among them. These issues have been addressed recently using the Randall-Sundrum model [5] , where the Higgs field lives on the IR brane while gravity propagates into the bulk [6] - [8] . This setup allows for a calculable description of the Higgs physics [9] , but introduces additional complications due to the presence of Kaluza-Klein gravitons [10] .",1,0
"We present evidence that the strong equivalence principle (SEP) holds in general relativity at least up to second post Newtonian order, by showing that the SEP is satisfied if it holds at first PN order.We show this by directly integrating the relaxed Einstein field equations with an appropriate source term which incorporates the effects of gravitational waves generated by accelerating bodies. The results are consistent with those obtained previously using perturbation theory. This work was supported by NSF grant PHY-0456747. In this article we will consider only isolated systems where no external forces act on any body. For such systems the total energy E = T + U , where T is the kinetic energy and U is the potential energy associated with all interactions between particles within the system. If there were no gravitational fields then the total energy would be conserved since the net force acting on each particle vanishes. However when gravitational fields exist they can exchange energy with matter through emission or absorption of gravitational waves.",1,0
"We study the conformational properties of one- and two-component bottlebrush polymers in good solvent conditions by means of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, using an off-lattice model with freely jointed chains. We compare our results for the radius of gyration Rg(N), end-to-end distance Ree(N), persistence length P(N), and contour length Lc(N) as functions of chain length N to those obtained within the framework of the worm-like-chain (WLC) theory. The WLC approach is found to be very accurate at predicting the scaling behavior of these quantities over several orders of magnitude in chain lengths. In particular, we find that the persistence length scales linearly with the number of monomers per backbone segment, which agrees well with recent experimental findings on bottle-brush polyelectrolytes.Keywords: Polymer brushes, Persistence length",1,0
"We report the discovery of two new TeV PWN candidates, HESS J1825-137 and HESS J1857+026, using data taken with the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) between 2004 and 2007. The sources are spatially coincident with extended radio emission that is likely to be associated with supernova remnants G18.0-0.7 and CTB 37A respectively. Both objects show hard power-law spectra extending up to at least 100 GeV. We discuss possible scenarios for their origin as well as implications on our understanding of particle acceleration mechanisms within PWNe. Keywords: Very high energy gamma ray astronomy, Pulsar Wind Nebula, Supernova Remnant, Particle Acceleration. 1 Introduction Pulsar Wind Nebulae (PWNe) are believed to be powered by relativistic winds ejected from young rotation-powered pulsars [1] . These winds interact with surrounding material creating shocks which accelerate particles to extremely high energies [2] , resulting in synchrotron radiation observed across the electromagnetic spectrum [3] . The detection of high-energy photons emitted by these systems can provide important information about the physical processes occurring inside them [4] . In particular, observations above 10 GeV have been used to study the spectral properties of several known PWNe [5] . However, only one object has so far been detected beyond 30 GeV [6] . This lack of detections may be due to the fact that most current instruments were not designed specifically for this purpose or because they operate under unfavourable observing conditions such as large zenith angles [7, 8] .",1,0
"We study the two-dimensional (2D) Ising model on square lattices with competing nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic interaction J1, next-nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic interaction J2, and external magnetic field H. We find that for small values of J2 there is no phase transition at finite temperature T in this system. However, when J2 increases beyond some critical value, we observe two successive transitions between paramagnetic state and ordered states as T decreases. The first-order transition line ends at tricritical point where second-order transition starts. In addition, we show that the ground-state energy per spin can be used to predict whether or not an array of π-rings will exhibit macroscopic degeneracy. Finally, by using the exact solution of 2D Ising model, we propose a new scheme for implementing adiabatic quantum computing which may lead to faster algorithms than those based on conventional methods. Two-dimensional Ising models have been studied extensively over past decades due to their rich physics and wide applications ranging from statistical mechanics [1] , condensed matter physics [2] , and biophysics [3] . Recently, it has also attracted much attention because of its potential use in designing efficient quantum computers [4] . In this work, we consider the following Hamiltonian, where Sx = ± 1 are classical spins located at each site x of a square lattice; J1 > 0 denotes the strength of nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic coupling while J2 < 0 represents the strength of next-nearest neighbor antifermomagnetic coupling. Here, h stands for the magnitude of external magnetic field applied along positive z-direction. It should be noted that our results remain valid even if one replaces the term −J2Sx2Sy2 with −J2(Sx1 + Sy1)(Sx2 + Sy2). This is because both terms give rise to same contribution after summation over all sites y such that |y| = 2.",1,0
"The author considers the problem of gravitational interaction between bodies in terms of their informational content. The main idea is that the gravitational field can be considered as an ensemble of gravitons which carry information about the source body. Gravitational waves are treated as carriers of information on the state of motion of gravitating objects. It is shown how this approach allows one to explain some phenomena observed in astrophysics (the Pioneer anomaly) and cosmology (dark energy). In addition, it is proposed to use the concept of 'information potential' for describing the evolution of the universe. This article was published by the journal Classical and Quantum Gravity Volume 27, Issue 14, pages 5993-6010, November 2010. DOI: 10.1088/0264-9381/27/14/05993/abstract. The following text is taken directly from the original publication.AbstractWe consider the problem of gravitational interaction among bodies in terms of their information content. The main idea here is that the gravitational field may be viewed as an ensemble of gravitons/quanta carrying information about the source body; gravitational waves are then seen as carriers of information regarding the state of motion of the gravitating objects. This viewpoint enables us to provide explanations for certain phenomena observed in astrophysical settings (e.g., the Pioneer anomaly), as well as in cosmological contexts (e.g., dark energy). Moreover, we propose using the notion of “information potential” to describe the evolution of the Universe.",1,0
"We present new spectroscopic observations for two globular clusters (GCs) in the nearby galaxy NGC 5128, which is known as Centaurus A. The GCs are located at projected distances of3 kpc to10 kpc from the nucleus of this elliptical galaxy. We have obtained high-resolution spectra with Gemini/GMOS-S on three different nights during 2013-14. These data allow us to measure radial velocities accurate to better than 1 km/sec for both GCs. In addition we also obtain line-of-sight velocity dispersions using these same GMOS-S data. For one cluster, we find that its systemic velocity agrees well with previous measurements by other authors. However, our measurement for the second cluster differs significantly from previously published values. This discrepancy may be due to contamination from an underlying stellar population or possibly because it has been misclassified as a GC.",1,0
"We present new optical photometry for the open cluster NGC 6791, obtained with the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) aboard HST as part of program GO-12775 (PI: A. Dotter). The data cover an area of 0.5 deg2 around the cluster center at high spatial resolution (0.1 arcsec/pixel), allowing us to study individual stars down to V = 20 mag. We use these observations together with archival WFC3/UVIS images taken under programs GO-10775 (PI: J. Kalirai) and GO-11775 (PI: S. Casagrande) to derive accurate stellar parameters for more than 1000 red giant branch (RGB) stars in this cluster. Our analysis shows that RGB mass loss is very efficient among low-mass stars, leading to the formation of white dwarfs with masses below 0.45 M . This result has important implications for our understanding of the evolution of low-mass stars near the end of their lives.Keywords: Open clusters",1,0
"The solar cycle is an important phenomenon in space weather, which can have significant effects on Earth and its technological infrastructure. The prediction of future solar activity has been studied for many years with varying degrees of success.In this work we use mean-field models to predict the next solar cycle (24) based on data from previous cycles. We find that our model predicts the amplitude of the current cycle well but underestimates the length by about one year. Our results suggest that the Sun will enter into minimum phase around 2013-14 followed by maximum phase around 2017-18. This prediction agrees reasonably well with other recent predictions made by different groups. However, it should be noted that there are large uncertainties associated with these predictions due to the chaotic nature of the solar dynamo process. Future observations may help reduce some of these uncertainties. Keywords: Space Weather, Solar Dynamo, Mean Field Modeling, Prediction",1,0
"We present an explicit construction for the CKM matrix, VCKM, in terms of the neutrino mixing matrices UPMNS and UMNS. The latter are defined as unitary transformations that diagonalize the Majorana mass matrices MPMNS and MMNS respectively. We show how this mapping can be used to derive relations between observables associated with quarks and leptons. In particular we find that the Jarlskog invariant JCPV is related to the lepton CP violating phase Δ by JCPV = 2 Δcos(2 θ_13) where θ_13 denotes the Cabibbo angle. This relation holds independently of whether or not there exists a Dirac CP violating phase in the PMNS matrix. Furthermore it allows us to relate the quark and lepton unitarity triangles. Finally we discuss possible implications on models beyond the Standard Model. Introduction: It has been known since the work of Kobayashi-Maskawa [1] , that the observed pattern of flavor changing neutral currents (FCNCs), which occur at tree level in the standard model (SM), requires new physics contributions [2] . These FCNC processes have so far only been observed within experimental uncertainties consistent with SM predictions [3] . In order to explain these results one usually assumes that the underlying theory respects some form of approximate symmetry [4] . One possibility would be to assume that the Yukawa couplings respect such symmetries [5] . However, if the fermion masses arise through spontaneous breaking of global symmetries [6] then the resulting effective Lagrangian will contain higher dimensional operators [7] . Such operators may induce large effects in FCNC processes [8] . Alternatively, one could consider extensions of the SM gauge group [9] .",1,0
We propose to search for new physics in events with two energetic jets and large missing transverse energy (MET) using data collected by the CDF experiment during Run II of Fermilab's Tevatron Collider. The MET is due to the presence of weakly-interacting stable massive particles that escape detection. We consider models where these particles are produced via interactions mediated by heavy gauge bosons associated with an extended electroweak symmetry group SU(2)xSU(3). In this class of models there exist exotic states such as color octets or triplets which can decay into pairs of quarks and/or gluons leading to final state signatures similar to those expected from supersymmetric theories. These models predict cross sections larger than Standard Model backgrounds over most of the parameter space considered here. This analysis will be performed on 1 fb-1 of integrated luminosity recorded by CDF between 2002-2007 corresponding to about 2 million events.,1,0
"We study the thermodynamics of the Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) black hole by using the tunneling method, which is based on the WKB approximation to quantum gravity. We find that there are two kinds of Hawking radiations for this black hole: one is thermal radiation with temperature T = 1/2πr0, where r0 is the radius of event horizon; another is nonthermal radiation with temperature T = 0. The latter can be regarded as the effect of the cosmological constant Λ. In addition, we also calculate the entropy of the SdS black hole and show that it agrees well with Bekenstein-Hawking entropy when the mass M ≫ 1/(8πGΛ). Finally, we discuss some possible applications of our results. It has been shown recently that the existence of the cosmological constant leads to new phenomena in physics [1] . For example, the vacuum fluctuations around an electrically charged particle lead to spontaneous emission [2] , while those around a neutral particle result in stimulated emission [3] . Moreover, the presence of the cosmological constant may affect the evaporation process of black holes [4] . In fact, the effects of the cosmological constant have already been studied extensively in the literature [5] - [8] . However, most works focus only on static or stationary black holes. Recently, the authors [9] investigated the thermodynamic properties of the Reissner-Nordström-de Sitter (RNdS) black hole by applying the tunneling method [10] . They found that besides the usual thermal radiation, there exists another kind of Hawking radiation whose temperature vanishes at the end point of evaporation. This phenomenon was interpreted as the effect of the negative pressure due to the cosmological constant [11] . Furthermore, they showed that the entropy of the RNdS black hole agrees very well with BekensteinHawking entropy [12] if its charge Q satisfies Q ≫ G/(2πℓ), where ℓ denotes the radius of the event horizon.",1,0
"The information-based asset pricing model is an extension to the traditional CAPM (Capital Assets Pricing Model) that incorporates additional factors into its analysis.The first factor, market risk premium, represents the excess return investors demand for holding risky assets over and above their returns on low-risk investments such as Treasury bills or bonds.The second factor, size effect, captures differences in expected returns between small-cap stocks and large-cap stocks.The third factor, value effect, measures the difference in returns between high book-to-market ratio stocks and low book-to-market ratio stocks; this factor has been shown to be particularly important during periods when interest rates are falling.This article provides a brief overview of these three factors along with some examples of how they can affect investment decisions. The Capital Assets Pricing Model (CAPM), developed by Sharpe (1964), Lintner (1965), Mossin (1966), and Black (1972), is one of the most widely used models in finance today.It states that the expected rate of return on any given security should equal the sum of two components - the risk-free rate plus a risk premium associated with the level of systematic risk inherent in each security.In other words, if you hold a portfolio consisting only of risk-free securities then your expected return will simply be the risk-free rate; however, if you hold a diversified portfolio containing both risky and non-risky securities then your expected rate of return will increase proportionately with the amount of risk you take on.For example, suppose we have a hypothetical investor who holds a portfolio consisting of 50",1,0
"We study the non-equilibrium evolution of an interacting onedimensional Bose gas initially prepared in a coherent state with finite particle number fluctuations and show that it exhibits universal features, which are independent of microscopic details such as interactions or initial conditions. We find that the system evolves into a stationary state characterized by non-vanishing density-density correlations at all distances. The time dependence of these correlations is governed by a single parameter, which we identify with the inverse temperature of the final equilibrium state. This allows us to determine this temperature directly from experimental data without any fitting parameters. Our results provide new insights into the nonequilibrium physics of quantum many-body systems and may be tested experimentally using ultracold atoms trapped in optical lattices.I. INTRODUCTORY REMARK The recent development of techniques for trapping and manipulating cold atomic gases has opened up exciting possibilities for studying strongly correlated quantum matter far from thermal equilibrium [1] . In particular, experiments have demonstrated how isolated quantum systems can evolve towards their ground states [2] , while being driven out of equilibrium by sudden changes in external control parameters [3] . In this work, we consider the case where the system is suddenly quenched across a phase transition [4] . For example, if the particles were originally confined to a harmonic trap, they would expand freely after switching off the confining potential [5] . Alternatively, the system could be initialized in its ground state [6] before undergoing a rapid change in some other parameter (e.g., magnetic field) [7, 8] . In both cases, the subsequent relaxation process will depend crucially on whether the system was initially prepared close to equilibrium [9] or not [10] . If the latter situation applies, then the system typically relaxes towards a metastable state [11] whose properties cannot be inferred from those of the original equilibrium ensemble [12] .",1,0
"We present the first measurement of the gamma-ray emission associated with the hot gas in galaxy clusters using data collected by Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). We find that the observed gamma-ray luminosity is consistent with theoretical predictions based on the assumption that the energy density of relativistic particles follows closely that of thermal plasma, as expected for hadronic models where cosmic rays are accelerated at shocks driven into intracluster medium by mergers or AGN activity. The inferred cosmic ray pressure is found to be comparable to the thermal pressure within r500 but decreases more rapidly outside this radius. This result suggests that cosmic rays may play an important role in regulating cluster dynamics over large scales. In addition, we use our results together with those obtained previously by Suzaku X-ray observatory to constrain the fraction of nonthermal pressure support in galaxy clusters. Our analysis indicates that the contribution of cosmic rays to total pressure can reach up to 30",1,0
"The origin and evolution of cosmic magnetic fields are one of the most important unsolved problems in astrophysics, which is closely related to many other fundamental issues such as star formation, galaxy formation and structure formation. In this talk I will review our recent work on simulating primordial magnetic fields with different physical processes involved. The first part focuses on the generation of seed magnetic fields during inflation by quantum fluctuations. We show that these seeds can be amplified significantly after reheating due to the magnetohydrodynamic turbulence driven by the decaying inflaton perturbations. Then we discuss how these seeds evolve into large-scale coherent magnetic fields through various mechanisms including inverse cascade, dynamo action and turbulent pumping. Finally, we present some possible observational signatures for future detection. This talk was given at the International Conference on ComputationTheory (ICCT) held in Beijing, China between September 24-27, 2014.",1,0
"We report on the evaporation of buffer-gas thermalized ions in a linear quadrupole ion trap (QIT). The QIT is filled with helium buffer gas at pressures between 0 and 1 mbar, which leads to temperatures up to 1000 K for trapped ions. We evaporate the ions by lowering the temperature of the surrounding helium bath down to 300 K within less than one second. This results in a significant reduction of the number density inside the QIT without affecting its trapping properties significantly. In this way we are able to reduce the number of stored ions by more than two orders of magnitude while keeping their kinetic energy below 10 eV per charge state. Our experimental findings agree well with theoretical predictions based on rate equations describing the time evolution of the number densities of all relevant species involved.IntroductionMultipole radio-frequency ion traps have been used extensively over the past decades as mass spectrometers [1] . They provide high resolution and sensitivity [2] , but they suffer from space-charge effects when storing large numbers of ions [3] . Space charge can be reduced by cooling the ions [4] or by removing them selectively [5] . Cooling requires sophisticated laser systems [6] that may not always be available. Selective removal has been demonstrated using pulsed electric fields [7, 8] , collisions with neutral atoms [9] , photoionization [10] , electron impact ionization [11] , and resonant photodissociation [12] .In our experiment, we use selective removal via rapid heating of the helium buffer gas [13] . Heating the helium causes the ions to lose their kinetic energy rapidly through elastic collisions [14] . As a result, the ions escape the trap volume before they gain enough energy to cause space charge problems [15] . A similar approach was recently reported [16] where the authors heated the helium buffer gas directly instead of indirectly via the ions [17] .Herein, we present detailed measurements of the process of evaporative cooling of buffer gas-thermalised ions in a linear quadrupolar ion trap (QIT) [18] . We show how the number density of the ions decreases exponentially after switching off the helium flow into the vacuum chamber containing the",1,0
"We present the results of our analysis on GRB 080916C, one of the most energetic bursts ever detected by Swift/BAT and Fermi/GBM. We find that this burst is consistent with being produced in an off-axis jet viewed at an angle θ60° to its axis. The observed light curve can be explained as emission from two components: (1) A bright component which peaks early during the prompt phase; it has a duration T90 = 1 s and a fluence Fγ = 2×10−6 erg cm−2. (2) An extended tail lasting for several hundred seconds after the end of the prompt phase; it contains about half of the total energy emitted by the source. Using detailed modeling we show that both these features are naturally reproduced if the burst was generated within a dense stellar wind environment surrounding a Wolf-Rayet star. In particular, we demonstrate how the density profile of such winds leads to a double-peaked structure in the time integrated spectrum of the burst.",1,0
"We present an efficient method for computing the vacuum energy and force between two parallel plates using only standard numerical electromagnetism methods, without resorting to any approximations or special treatments such as analytic continuation into complex frequencies. The key idea is that we can use the Feynman-Kac formula to express the vacuum expectation value of the stress tensor at finite temperature T = 1/β (where β is the inverse temperature) in terms of the corresponding quantity at zero temperature but with one additional term involving the time evolution operator over a period of length β . We then show how this expression may be evaluated efficiently by expressing it in terms of the Green's function of Maxwell's equations on a periodic domain. This allows us to compute the vacuum energy and force exactly within our computational framework, which consists of solving the vector wave equation numerically on a rectangular grid. Our results are compared against those obtained previously using other approaches, including analytic continuation into complex frequencies and the PFA.",1,0
"We present an explanation to the observed anomalies in globular cluster luminosity functions (GCLFs) and mass-to-light ratios, based on the assumption that these clusters are composed by two different populations with distinct chemical compositions.We show how this hypothesis can be tested using photometric data obtained at near-infrared wavelengths. The proposed scenario is able to explain all the main observational features associated to GCLFs:i) the presence of a peaked distribution; ii) its width; iii) the existence of a tail towards high luminosities; iv) the lack of low-luminosity stars. In addition, it also explains why some GCs have very large values of M/LV . Finally we discuss possible implications of our results regarding the formation history of globulars.

"We report the discovery and characterization of TrES-3b, an extrasolar planet with mass M = 1.3 MJup orbiting its host star every 31 hours at 0.081 AU (1.7 stellar radii). The planet is one of only two known transiting planets that are more massive than Saturn but less massive than Neptune; it has a radius R = 2.2 RJup and effective temperature T eff = 2400 K. We find no evidence for additional bodies in this system using radial velocity measurements taken over three years. This planet's proximity to Earth makes it an excellent target for atmospheric studies.Keywords: Extrasolar planet - Discovery - Transit photometry - Radial velocities - Atmosphere - Planetary systemsIntroductionIn recent years there have been several discoveries of giant exoplanets with orbital periods shorter than four days. These short-period planets are particularly interesting because they may be tidally locked into synchronous rotation about their axes, which would lead to strong day-night contrasts on their surfaces. Furthermore, these planets' atmospheres will experience extreme conditions due to high temperatures and intense radiation fields. As such, understanding how planetary atmospheres respond under these circumstances can provide important insights into processes occurring within our own Solar System as well as other planetary systems.Here we present the discovery and initial characterization of TrES-3b; a hot Jupiter with a period P = 3.09 d discovered by the transit method. Using follow-up observations made with the Spitzer Space Telescope, we show that TrES-3b orbits close enough to its parent star so that tidal forces should synchronize the planet's spin axis with its orbital angular momentum vector. However, we do not detect any significant infrared excess emission associated with the planet itself or its host star, indicating that either the planet does not possess a large amount of dusty material surrounding it and/or that the planet is too cool to produce detectable thermal emission beyond 4 microns.",1,0
"We study how the properties of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) affect their radio morphologies, and in particular whether they can explain the observed difference between Fanaroff-Riley type I (FRI) and II (FRII). We use high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations to follow the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), which are fed by cold gas accretion at rates that depend on the SMBH mass and its environment. The resulting jets are simulated using relativistic magnetohydrodynamics with an adiabatic index of 4/3. Our results show that FRIs have lower jet powers than FRIIs for similar BH masses because of differences in the accretion rate onto the central BH. This is consistent with observations showing that FRIs typically reside in less massive galaxies compared to FRIIs. In addition, we find that FRIs produce more collimated jets due to higher magnetic field strengths close to the BH horizon.",1,0
"The present work is devoted to the investigation of new possible nuclear properties using nonlinear methods, namely fractal dimension (FD) and recurrence quantification analysis (RQA). The FD was calculated for different mass number A in order to study its dependence on the system size. It has been found that there exists an optimal value of the scaling parameter which provides the best results for each nucleus separately. This fact indicates that the structure of the studied systems can be characterized as multifractals with non-trivial behavior. In addition we have shown that the obtained values are very close to those predicted by the percolation theory. We also applied RQA method to investigate the temporal evolution of the considered systems. Our calculations show that the complexity of the time series increases with increasing mass number A. Moreover it turns out that this increase follows closely the predictions made within the framework of the Random Matrix Theory. Finally we have compared our results with experimental data available for some light nuclei.",1,0
"We study the non-adiabatic current through an open quantum dot connected to two leads with different chemical potentials, which is driven by time-dependent gate voltages applied on both sides of the dot. We show that this system can be described as a 'turnstile' where electrons are pumped between the leads when the driving frequencies match certain resonances. The effect is robust against disorder and dephasing. This work was supported by NSERC (Canada) and CIFAR (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research). In recent years there has been growing interest in studying electron pumps based on semiconductor nanostructures such as quantum dots or carbon nanotubes [1, 2] . These devices have potential applications ranging from metrology [3] , single-electron transistors [4] , and spintronics [5] . In these systems, charge carriers are transported across the device via sequential tunneling processes [6] . A number of theoretical studies [7, 8] have shown that it is possible to achieve high efficiency in these devices even at room temperature [9] . However, most previous works focused only on adiabatic pumping [10] , i.e., the case where the frequency of the external drive is much smaller than all other relevant energy scales [11] . Recently, several experiments [12, 13] reported large currents generated by nonadiabatic pumping [14, 15] . It remains unclear whether these results can be explained within existing theories [16] . Here we consider a simple model of a quantum dot connected to two metallic leads [see Fig. 1(a) ] [17] . The dot level is modulated periodically by applying oscillating gate voltages V L/R = ±V 0 cos ωt on each side of the dot [18] . When the modulation period T ≡ 2π/ω matches one of the dwell times τ n = π /[2(E F − E n )] associated with the discrete levels E n of the isolated dot, electrons will be transferred coherently between the left and right leads [19] . Here E F denotes the Fermi energy of the leads [20] . As illustrated schematically in Figs. 1(b-c), depending on",1,0
"We study the holographic entanglement entropy for three-dimensional de Sitter space with gravitational Chern-Simons term by using the replica trick and the covariant phase-space method. We find that there is no logarithmic correction to the entanglement entropy, which agrees with previous results obtained via other methods. In addition, we show that the first-order corrections are proportional to the square root of the volume enclosed by the entangling surface. Finally, we calculate the second-order corrections and obtain an expression containing two terms. One of them has been previously found in Ref. [Phys. Rev. D 98 (2018) 084011] while another one is new. The latter can be written as a sum over all possible contractions between the Riemann tensor and its derivatives at the boundary points. This result shows that the gravitational Chern-Simons coupling constant plays a role similar to the Newton's constant in four dimensions.",1,0
"We present the results of simultaneous X-ray (Chandra) and radio (RXTE )observations of the Broad Line Radio Galaxy, 3C382 . The data were taken on 2001 September 24-25 UT during an outburst in which the source was detected at radio frequencies as high as 22 GHz. We find that the X-ray spectrum is well described by a power law with photon index Γ = 1.7 ± 0.1 modified by photoelectric absorption consistent with N_H = 2 x 1022 cm-2. There are no significant spectral changes between the two epochs observed. In addition to the continuum emission we detect several narrow lines including Fe Kα , He-like Si XIII , S XV and Ar XVII . These features appear blueshifted relative to their rest wavelengths indicating bulk motion towards us along our line-of-sight. Using these velocities together with estimates for the mass of the central black hole derived from optical measurements we estimate the distance of the emitting material from the center of the AGN to be10 light days.",1,0
"We present the first exact local solution to the equations of motion for type II B supergravity in AdS 5 × S 5 . The solution is supported by two independent harmonic functions, one on each side of an arbitrary surface Σ which divides space into three regions. We show that this solution preserves eight real supercharges and has vanishing central charge. It can be interpreted as a bound state of N = 4 SYM theory with gauge group SU(N)×SU(N), where the number of degrees of freedom scales like O(N 2 ) at large N. In addition we find a new class of solutions describing interfaces between different vacua of the same field theory. These are obtained by taking appropriate limits of our general solution. They preserve four supercharges and have non-vanishing central charges. One particular member of this family describes a supersymmetric Janus-like configuration interpolating between two distinct conformal fixed points of the same field theory.IntroductionThe study of holographic duals of strongly coupled quantum systems has been greatly advanced over recent years through the use of string/M-theory [1, 2] . A particularly interesting application of these ideas involves studying non-conformal theories using their dual description in terms of gravitational backgrounds [3, 4] . In order to construct such models it is necessary to solve the equations of motion associated with the relevant supergravity or gauged supergravity theory. This problem becomes more tractable when considering specific classes of solutions preserving some fraction of the original supersymmetry [5] , since only certain combinations of fields may then appear [6] . For example, if one considers configurations preserving all but one of the original supersymmetries (BPS states), then the resulting system will depend upon just five scalar fields [7, 8] . However, even in this case finding explicit solutions remains difficult [9] . One approach to solving BPS-type problems is to consider special cases where the geometry admits additional symmetries [10] . An important subclass of such solutions arises when the internal manifold M 6 factorises into a product of two spaces M 3 × M 3 [11] . In this",1,0
"We study the asymptotic behavior as |x|→∞ of solutions to certain homogenized spectral problems associated with Schrödinger-type operators on unbounded domains in R^n, n≥ 3.We show that if the potential is periodic and satisfies some mild decay conditions at infinity then there exists an explicit formula for the leading term of this expansion which involves only the first two terms of the Taylor series of the potential about zero. This result generalizes previous results obtained by one of us (S.V.) for potentials satisfying stronger decay assumptions near infinity.The proof relies heavily on the fact that the spectrum of these operators consists entirely of eigenvalues of finite multiplicity. The main idea behind our approach is to use the method of matched asymptotic expansions together with suitable integral representations of the solution to obtain information about its large-x behavior. In particular we prove that under appropriate hypotheses on the coefficients of the operator the solution has an exponential decay rate at infinity.",1,0
"We study the relationship between Dirichlet sigma-models on Riemannian manifolds with boundary, and mean curvature flows in the interior of these manifolds.We show that if the initial metric is conformally equivalent to the standard round sphere then there exists an explicit solution for all time which converges exponentially fast towards the round sphere as t →∞.In particular we prove that this holds true even when the manifold has corners or conical singularities at its boundary.The results are obtained by combining techniques from geometric analysis (in particular heat kernel estimates) and functional analysis (in particular spectral theory).Keywords: Mean Curvature Flow, Sigma Models, Conformal Geometry, Geometric Analysis, Functional Analysis. 1 IntroductionLet (M^n,g_0) be a compact smooth Riemannian n-manifold with nonempty boundary ∂ M = ∅. Consider the following evolution equation for metrics g_t on M:g_t+1 = e^-2tH_gg_t where H_g denotes the mean curvature vector field of the hypersurface M^n equipped with the metric g. This is called the Ricci-DeTurck flow [DeT84], since it can also be written as:g^ij_t = e^-2tH_gg^ij_0 + 2e^-2tH_gΓ_ij^k∇_k log g_0j Here, Γ_ij^k denote the Christoffel symbols associated to the metric g. If one starts with a metric g such that the scalar curvature R_g satisfies R_g > 0 everywhere, then the above flow preserves positivity of the scalar curvature. Moreover, if the initial metric is Einstein, i.e., R_g = c g_0 for some constant c>0, then the flow will preserve Einstein-ness.",1,0
"The Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino experiment (KATRIN) is currently under construction at the Karlsruhe Institute for Technology, Germany. It will measure the electron energy spectrum near the endpoint with unprecedented precision by using an electrostatic retardation spectrometer combined with a magnetic filter. The measurement aims at determining the absolute value of the effective electron antineutrino mass mneff with a statistical uncertainty of 0.2 eV/c2 or better. In this contribution we present results on the expected sensitivities of KATRIN to mneff as well as to possible contributions from right-handed currents in beta-decay. We show that these sensitivities are mainly determined by systematic uncertainties which can be controlled within the experimental accuracy required. This allows us to conclude that KATRIN has excellent prospects to determine mneff precisely enough to test whether it agrees with the predictions of standard model extensions such as supersymmetry.",1,0
"We present results on the role played by the rho meson in describing pion electroproduction data obtained with the CLAS detector at Jefferson Lab (JLab). The analysis is performed within an effective field theory approach, where we use chiral perturbation theory to describe the interaction between pions and nucleons up to next-to-leading order. We then introduce vector-meson degrees of freedom through the hidden gauge formalism. In particular, we consider contributions coming from one-loop diagrams involving rho mesons as well as tree-level processes mediated by rho mesons. Our theoretical framework allows us to study both neutral current reactions such as elastic ep scattering or charged current reactions like single-pion production off protons. Using this model, we are able to reproduce experimental data for all these observables simultaneously. Finally, we discuss how our findings can be used to extract information about the properties of the rho meson.

"We present new observations and analysis of the neutron star (NS) candidate RX J1856.5-37543, which is one of only two NSs with measured parallaxes to date.We use these measurements along with optical photometry in order to constrain its radius and distance as well as the interstellar extinction towards it. Our results are consistent with previous estimates for this source's radius but we find that our best-fit model has an unusually large value of A V = 1.6 ± 0.2 mag compared to other nearby stars. This suggests that there may be additional absorption by dust associated with the system or possibly even circumstellar material around the NS itself. The latter possibility would have important implications for understanding how such objects form.

"We present an algorithm for the construction of a discrete computer network in which each node is connected to all nodes within its distance, and also to some other nodes at larger distances. The number of additional connections per node increases exponentially as one moves away from it along any path. We show that this property can be used to construct efficient routing tables for such networks. Our results are based on a new concept called 'expanding dimension'. This concept allows us to define a natural hierarchy among the nodes of our network. In particular, we prove that if there exists a polynomial time algorithm for finding shortest paths between two given nodes then there must exist another polynomial time algorithm for solving the same problem but restricted only to pairs of nodes whose distance belongs to a certain range. Finally, we discuss possible applications of these ideas to distributed computing problems. Keywords: Computer network, Expanding Dimension, Hierarchy, Routing",1,0
"We have studied by means of molecular dynamics simulations how the dynamic behavior of silver atoms deposited on gold (100) is affected when the substrate temperature and the coverage are varied in such a way that the average number of nearest neighbors per atom changes between 1 to 4. We find that, for low coverages, the system behaves as if it were made up of isolated particles with no interaction among them. However, at higher coverages we observe collective effects which lead to the formation of ordered structures. The results obtained show that these structures can be classified into two different categories depending on whether they are formed by one or more layers of silver atoms. In particular, we found that the structure of the first layer depends strongly on the substrate temperature while the second layer shows only small variations. Finally, our calculations indicate that the third layer forms a disordered arrangement of silver atoms. This work was supported by DGESIC under project PB98-0443-C02-01",1,0

"We study information diffusion on networks with multiple communities, where each community has its own set of nodes and edges. We propose an epidemic model that captures the effect of both global and local interactions between users within different communities. The proposed model is based on two key ideas: (1) we assume that there are some influential individuals who can spread information to their neighbors faster than others; and (2) we allow for cross-influences among neighboring communities through these influential individuals. Our main goal is to understand how the structure of the underlying network affects the spreading process. In particular, our contributions include:1. We develop a novel mathematical framework to analyze the dynamics of information diffusion under the proposed epidemic model. 2. We show that if all communities have similar sizes then the number of infected nodes at time t grows as O(t log n), where n denotes the total number of nodes in the network. 3. We prove that if one community dominates the other ones by size then the number of infected individuals grows exponentially fast. 4. Finally, we provide extensive numerical experiments to validate our theoretical results.",1,0
"We present near-infrared (NIR) observations toward two millimeter dust cores, MM1 and MM2, located at the edge of the Vela Molecular Ridge cloud D. The NIR data were obtained with Subaru/Suprime-Cam on 2005 December 8-9 under photometric conditions. We detected several point sources associated with each core. In addition to these point-like objects, we found extended emission around MM1 that is likely due to scattered light by interstellar grains. Using our NIR data together with previous infrared and radio continuum surveys, we investigated the nature of the observed objects. Our results are summarized as follows:1. Two brightest point-like objects within MM1 have been identified as young stellar objects based on their spectral energy distributions.2. One of them shows an excess flux over its photosphere in K-band which suggests the presence of circumstellar disks or envelopes.3. Another object has no significant excess but exhibits strong Hα emission line suggesting active accretion onto the central star.4. Several other fainter point-like objects show neither excess nor Hα emission lines indicating they may be background stars.5. Extended emission was also seen around MM1.",1,0
"We present an explicit criterion to determine whether or not two given multipartite quantum states are separable, i.e., can be written as convex combinations of product states. The criterion is formulated in terms of the Bloch representation of the corresponding density matrices and it relies only on local measurements performed by each party. We show that our method provides a necessary condition for separability which is strictly weaker than other known criteria. Finally we illustrate its usefulness with some examples. Introduction:-The problem of determining if a given state belongs to the set of separable states has been extensively studied during last years [1] . In particular, several authors have proposed different methods to solve this problem [2] - [4] , but none of them seems to provide a complete solution yet. Recently, Vidal et al [5] introduced a new approach to study separability problems using the Bloch representation [6] of the density matrix associated to any pure state. This technique allows one to obtain simple conditions for separability which involve only local measurements made by each party involved in the system under consideration. However, these results do not apply directly when dealing with mixed states since they require the knowledge of all possible pure-state decompositions of such states. Here we will use another version of the Bloch representation [7] to derive a general criterion for separability applicable also to mixed states. Our main result consists of showing that there exists at least one decomposition into pure states compatible with the Bloch representation of every separable state. As a consequence, we prove that the criterion presented here constitutes a necessary condition for separabilty which is strictly weaker than previous ones [8] . Preliminaries:-In what follows we consider N-partite systems described by Hilbert spaces H 1 ,H 2 ...H N . A generic element |ψ⟩ ∈ H = ∑ N i=1 H i is called a pure state vector while ρ ∈ D(H) denotes a density operator acting on H. Any density operator can always be expressed in terms of its spectral decomposition [9]where |λ⟩ λ=1,...,d is an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors of ρ and p λ ≥ 0 (p",1,0
"We present an analysis of gravitational lensing by large-scale structure in the universe, as traced by neutral hydrogen (HI) at high redshifts z > 6. We use numerical simulations to show that this effect is detectable with future radio telescopes such as SKA and ngVLA. The signal-to-noise ratio for detecting these effects depends on the angular resolution of the telescope used; we find that it can be improved significantly if one uses multiple frequency channels instead of single-frequency data. This technique could provide valuable information about dark matter halos at early times when they were still forming their first stars. In addition, our results suggest that the cosmic web may have been denser than previously thought. Finally, we discuss how this method could be applied to detect primordial black holes. Introduction -Gravitational lensing has become a powerful tool for studying the distribution of mass in the Universe. It allows us to probe structures which are too distant or small to be detected directly through other means. For example, galaxy clusters act like lenses, magnifying background galaxies behind them. By measuring the distortion caused by lensing, one can infer properties of the cluster's dark matter halo [1] . Similarly, weak gravitational lensing measurements allow astronomers to map out the total projected mass density field over large areas of sky [2] . In recent years there has been growing interest in applying gravitational lensing techniques to study high-redshift objects [3] , including the epoch of reionization [4] . However, most previous studies focused only on the lensing produced by visible matter, such as galaxies and quasars [5] . Here we consider another source of lensing: the intergalactic medium (IGM). At very high redshift, before galaxies formed, the IGM was filled with neutral hydrogen gas [6] . As time passed, some fraction of this gas became ionized due to ultraviolet radiation emitted by young stars [7, 8] . But even today, much of the IGM remains neutral [9] . Since the IGM contains more mass than any individual galaxy [10] , its contribution to lensing should not be ignored [11] . The goal of this",1,0
"We have read with interest the recent preprint [1] . In this work we find that the authors' claim to set an upper bound on the lifetime of the electron is not justified because they did not take into account all relevant decay channels.We would like to comment briefly on their treatment of backgrounds as well as their choice of cuts used to select events. The main source of background comes from radiative Bhabha scattering e+e-→e+e-γ which has been studied extensively at LEP2 [2] , where it was found to be negligible compared to other sources such as two-photon processes or four-fermion final states (e.g., W pair production). This process can only contribute if one photon escapes detection; however, since photons are emitted almost collinearly with electrons/positrons, the probability of missing both photons is very small. Furthermore, the cross section for this process decreases rapidly when the invariant mass of the lepton pairs increases [3] .The authors also use a cut on the total energy of the event, Evis>10 GeV, which removes most of these events. They do mention that there may still be some residual contamination due to radiative Bhabhas but argue that this will be suppressed by requiring the presence of additional jets. However, even though the jet multiplicity distribution does decrease slightly after applying this requirement, the effect is too small to compensate for the loss of signal efficiency caused by removing events with low visible energies.In addition, the authors state that the contribution from radiative Bhabhas should be included in the systematic uncertainty estimate. However, this statement is misleading given that the quoted systematic error already includes contributions from many different sources including those related to the modelling of initial-state radiation [4] .Finally, we note that the authors present results obtained using Monte Carlo simulations performed with PYTHIA 6 [5] . It is known [6] that this generator underestimates the number of high-multiplicity...",1,0
"We study the evolution of density fluctuations in massive gravity, which is an extension to general relativity that includes terms quadratic in curvature invariants. We show that this theory predicts a scale-invariant spectrum of primordial perturbations with amplitude given by Δ^2 R = (4π)^-3/2 H_0^2 ∼ 10^-20 at horizon crossing during inflation.This value agrees well with current observations of the cosmic microwave background anisotropy. The same mechanism also leads to a suppression of power on small scales due to nonlinear effects. In addition, we find that massive gravity can lead to significant modifications to the growth rate of large-scale structures compared to standard ΛCDM cosmology. These results are consistent with recent measurements of galaxy clustering using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Finally, we discuss how these predictions could be tested observationally through future surveys such as Euclid or LSST. Massive gravity is an extension to general",1,0
"The cosmic code comparison project is an effort to compare the results produced by different cosmological codes, and thereby test their accuracy.The goal is to produce a set of simulated data that can be used as input for any number of codes, and then have each code run on this same dataset.This will allow us to determine how well these codes agree with one another in terms of both the physical quantities they predict (e.g., matter density profiles) and also the statistical properties of those predictions (e.g., power spectra).We are currently working towards producing a large suite of simulations covering a wide range of parameter space, including dark energy models, modified gravity theories, neutrino masses, and primordial non-Gaussianity.

"We present an analysis method for characterizing the stability of optical phase in astronomical instruments, based on the measurement and characterization of fringe contrasts obtained with different integration times.We show that this method can be used to characterize both short-term (< 1 hour) and long-term (> 24 hours) instrumental instabilities. The results are compared against those obtained using other methods such as power spectral density or Allan variance measurements. This new technique is applied to data taken at the Palomar Observatory Interferometer during commissioning runs in 2007-2008. It allows us to identify specific sources of instability which could not have been detected by previous techniques. In particular we find that the main source of instability comes from atmospheric turbulence effects rather than mechanical vibrations. Finally, we demonstrate how our method can also be used to measure the coherence time of the atmosphere.

"We present measurements of the top quark mass in final states containing one or two jets and large missing transverse energy, based on data collected by the Collider Detector at Fermilab during Run I (1992-1996). The analysis uses an iterative likelihood fit to extract the signal yield as a function of the assumed top quark mass for each jet multiplicity bin. We find mtop = 174.3 +/- 1.7 GeV/c2(stat) +/-3.1(syst), where the systematic uncertainty is dominated by uncertainties associated with modeling of initial state radiation and gluon splitting.These results are consistent with previous measurements performed by D0 and CDF experiments.

"We report on the first detection of Compton scattering of iron K-alpha lines (6.4 keV) by hot plasma in magnetic cataclysmic variables (mCVs). The observations were made with Suzaku satellite, which has an unprecedented combination of high sensitivity and energy resolution at 6.4 keV for mCVs. We detected significant excess emission above continuum around 6.4 keV in three out of four targets observed. This is interpreted as Compton-scattered line photons produced in the accretion disk coronae surrounding white dwarfs. In one target, we found that the scattered component was significantly stronger than the direct component. Our results suggest that the geometry of the X-ray emitting region may be more complex than previously thought.Keywords: Accreting compact objects, Hot plasma, Iron K-shell lines, Compton scattering, Suzaku, Cataclysmic variable",1,0
"We report results of X-ray observations with Suzaku satellite of the nucleus of radio-loud active galaxy Centaurus A (NGC 5128). The data were obtained in 2006 and 2007, when the source was observed for about 100 ks each time. We find that the spectrum is well described by an absorbed power-law model modified at low energies by photoelectric absorption due to cold gas. No significant emission lines are detected above 3 keV. Using this spectral model we derive constraints on abundances of heavy elements in the accretion flow onto supermassive black hole located in the center of NGC 5128. In particular, we show that iron abundance relative to solar value cannot be higher than 1.5-2 times its solar value. This result agrees with previous findings based on Chandra observation but contradicts earlier XMM-Newton measurement which suggested much larger overabundance of iron. Our analysis also shows that the absorbing material has relatively high column density NH2 x 1023 cm-2 .",1,0
"We propose an alternative scenario for the evolution of our universe, which is based on the idea that the expansion rate of the universe may be driven by its curvature rather than dark energy. We show how this can lead to a viable cosmology with no need for dark energy and without any fine tuning problems associated with other models in the literature. In particular we find that:The model has a number of interesting features including:This work was supported by the Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Project DP0877481. Any opinions expressed are those of the authors only. 1 Introduction. The discovery of accelerated cosmic expansion [1, 2] , as well as the recent detection of gravitational waves [3] have led to renewed interest in understanding the nature of gravity at large scales [4] . A possible explanation for these phenomena could lie within the framework of modified theories of gravity [5] . In order to explain the observed acceleration of the universe it seems necessary to introduce some form of 'dark energy' [6] into Einstein's field equations [7, 8] . However, there appears to be little agreement amongst theorists about what exactly constitutes dark energy [9] or whether it should even exist [10] . Furthermore, if one assumes that dark energy exists then it must be extremely finely tuned [11] so that it behaves like a cosmological constant [12] over many orders of magnitude [13] . It also remains unclear why such a small value of vacuum energy density would arise naturally [14] . Another possibility is that the apparent accelerating behaviour of the universe arises due to quantum effects [15] . For example, loop quantum gravity [16] predicts that space-time becomes discrete [17] leading to corrections to the Friedmann equation [18] . These corrections become significant when the scale factor reaches values close to the Planck length [19] . Other approaches include string theory [20] where the extra dimensions of spacetime [21] provide another source of potential modifications [22] .",1,0
"Turbo codes are powerful error correcting codes that have been adopted in several wireless standards, such as WiMax and 3GPP-LTE. However, their performance is limited by an error floor at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). In this work we propose pseudo-random puncturing for turbo codes which can be used to lower the error floor. The proposed technique exploits the correlation between parity bits generated by different component encoders within a turbo code. We show through simulation results that our method outperforms existing techniques with respect to both coding gain and bit error rate (BER) performance. Finally, we present some practical considerations on how to implement the proposed scheme efficiently.Turbo codes were invented by Berrou et al., [1] and they are powerful error-correcting codes that have been widely adopted in many communication systems including WiMAX [2] , DVB-S2 [3] , and 3GPP-LTE [4] . Turbo codes achieve near Shannon limit performance over additive white Gaussian noise channels [5] . However, there exists an error floor [6] - [8] when using turbo codes due to the inherent structure of these codes [9] . This limits the use of turbo codes in applications where low BERs are required [10] . Several methods have been proposed to reduce or eliminate the error floor [11]- [16] . These include interleaver design [17] , iterative decoding [18] , soft-decision feedback [19] , irregular repeat accumulate [20] , and concatenated codes [21] .",1,0
"We study the dynamics of Lorentzian brane-worlds with time dependent bulk cosmological constant in the context of Randall-Sundrum type II models, where we allow for both positive and negative values of the bulk cosmological constant. We show that there are two branches of solutions corresponding to either an expanding or contracting universe on the brane depending upon whether the bulk cosmological constant is positive or negative respectively. In addition, we find that these solutions can be smoothly connected by a branch of static solutions which correspond to Minkowski space-time on the brane. Finally, we also consider the possibility of having a change of signature across the brane and discuss how this affects our results. The main motivation behind studying braneworld scenarios comes from the fact that they provide us with a natural framework within which one may address some of the fundamental issues related to quantum gravity such as the hierarchy problem [1] . However, it has been shown recently [2] , that even if one considers only classical gravitational effects, then the standard four dimensional Friedmann equations cannot be recovered unless certain conditions are satisfied. These include the requirement that the energy density of matter fields localized on the brane should satisfy the weak energy condition (WEC) [3] . In order to overcome this difficulty, several authors have considered different approaches [4] - [8] . For example, in ref. [6] , the authors studied the case when the bulk cosmological constant changes sign at late times thereby allowing them to obtain realistic cosmologies without violating WEC. On the other hand, in ref. [7] , the authors showed that it was possible to recover the standard Friedmann equation provided the stress-energy tensor satisfies the null energy condition (NEC).",1,0
"We report on multiwavelength observations of the X-ray, optical and radio afterglows of the short-hard gamma-ray burst (GRB) 050724 detected by Swift satellite at 07:24:06 UT on 24 July 2005. The prompt emission lasted for about 1 s with an average photon energy E = 300 keV in the 15-350 keV band. We find that the temporal decay index is1.2 between 10s to 1000s post-burst time scale which indicates that this event belongs to the class of ultra-long GRBs. In addition we also detect a possible rebrightening feature around 100s post-burst time-scale. Our spectral analysis shows that the spectrum can be fitted well using both single power-law model as well as broken power law model. However, the best fit parameters are found to be consistent within their errors when compared with each other. Using our multi-wavelength data set, we estimate the total energetics associated with this event to be3 x 1044 erg.",1,0
"We study the effect of depletants on the phase behavior of binary mixtures of hard rods and hard spheres by computer simulation. We find that for sufficiently large concentrations of depletant, the system undergoes an isostructural transition to a new smectic phase with a different layer spacing than found in pure systems. The results are explained within mean-field theory using a free energy functional approach. DOI: 10.1063/1.3189000 I. INTRODUCTIO N The addition of small particles (depletants) to colloidal suspensions can lead to dramatic changes in their structure [1] . In particular, it has been shown experimentally [2] , theoretically [3] , and computationally [4] that adding nonadsorbing polymer chains or other types of depletants leads to the formation of ordered structures such as crystals [5] . In this work we consider the case where the depletants are spherical particles which do not adsorb onto the surfaces of the larger colloids [6] . This type of interaction between the two species gives rise to a rich variety of phenomena [7, 8] including liquid crystal phases [9] . Here we focus our attention on one aspect of these mixtures -the effect of depletants upon the smectic phases formed by mixtures of hard rods and spheres [10] . Smectics are mesophases characterized by layers of parallel oriented molecules separated by regions of disordered fluid [11] . These materials have attracted considerable interest because they exhibit many properties similar to those observed in biological membranes [12] . For example, both smectic A and C phases form spontaneously when lipids are mixed with water [13] . It was recently suggested [14] that smectic phases may also be present in certain protein solutions [15] .",1,0

"Fullerenes are spherical molecules composed entirely of sp2-hybridized carbons, which can be arranged in different ways to form various allotropes with unique properties. The most common is the C60 molecule (buckminsterfullerene), but other forms such as nanotubes or graphene have also been reported. Fullerenes were first discovered by Kroto et al., who received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1996 for their work on them.In this study we report on the growth mechanism and structural characterization of novel carbon-based nanomaterials that consist of an amorphous network of interconnected nanoparticles resembling fullerenes. These structures grow spontaneously when evaporating carbon atoms onto silicon substrates at temperatures between 600-700 °C under ultrahigh vacuum conditions.

"We present the theory for anomalous diffusion in terms of fractional Fokker-Planck equations and apply it to study the time evolution of chemical reactions occurring on realistic self-affined fractals, such as porous media or biological tissues. We show that the rate at which reactants are consumed is determined by the geometry of the medium through an effective fractal dimension D(t) that evolves with time according to a nonlinear differential equation. The solution of this equation depends on the initial conditions and can be obtained numerically using standard methods. In particular we find that if the initial distribution has compact support then the system reaches equilibrium after some characteristic relaxation time t*. For times larger than t* the consumption rate becomes independent of the initial condition and coincides with the one predicted by classical mean field theories. This result suggests that the dynamics of chemical reactions in complex environments may be described by simple models based only on geometrical information about the environment.",1,0
"The question is not new, but it has been recently revived by the publication of two papers in Nature and Science that claim to show that biodiversity loss leads to ecosystem collapse.The authors argue that this finding should be taken seriously because ecosystems are essential for human well-being.They also point out that there have been many previous studies showing that biodiversity loss can lead to declines in ecosystem functioning (e.g., productivity) without necessarily causing an abrupt change in state or collapse.In this article we review these recent findings on biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships as well as some earlier results suggesting that biodiversity may sometimes enhance rather than reduce ecosystem stability.We conclude with a discussion about how our understanding of biodiversity-ecosystem function interactions could be improved through further research. Biodiversity loss is one of humanity's greatest challenges today. It threatens the sustainability of natural resources used directly by humans such as food production systems and water supply, and indirectly via changes in climate regulation and disease transmission pathways. There is growing concern over the rate at which species extinction rates are increasing globally due to anthropogenic activities including habitat destruction, pollution, overexploitation, and invasive alien species1–3. This situation has led to calls for urgent action to conserve biological diversity4–6. However, despite widespread recognition of the importance of conserving biodiversity7–10, there remains considerable uncertainty regarding its role in maintaining ecosystem functions11–13. A number of theoretical models suggest that biodiversity loss will cause reductions in ecosystem functioning14–16. For example, Tilman et al. (1997)17 showed theoretically that reducing plant species richness would decrease primary productivity in grassland communities. Similarly, NaeemLi (1998)18 found experimentally that removing species from soil microcosms reduced decomposition rates. These predictions were supported by numerous subsequent empirical studies19–22.",1,0
"We present the results of our analysis on the correlation between blazar activity and accretion disk luminosity in active galactic nuclei (AGN). We use data for all AGNs with available information about their black hole mass, bolometric luminosity, radio flux density at 5 GHz, and redshift taken from the literature. The sample consists of 1248 objects including both BL Lacertae-type and flat-spectrum radio quasars. Our main result is that there exists an anti-correlation between the radio emission produced by jets and the optical/UV radiation emitted by disks. This effect can be explained if we assume that the jet power decreases as the disk luminosity increases. In addition to this general trend, we find evidence for two separate branches in the distribution of sources along the radio-optical plane. One branch corresponds to low-luminosity AGNs whose radio emission correlates positively with the disk luminosity; another one includes high-luminosity AGN where the radio emission anticorrelates strongly with the disk luminosity.",1,0
"The Cryptoplanet project is an ongoing effort to collect and archive data on the world's cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC). The goal of this project is to provide researchers with access to historical information about these currencies in order to facilitate research into their underlying technologies.This article describes how we collected our dataset for analysis as well as some preliminary results that have been obtained using it. We also describe plans for future work. In recent years there has been growing interest among academics in studying virtual currency systems such as Bitcoin [1] . One reason for this interest is that many believe that Bitcoin's success will lead to the development of new types of digital payment systems [2] , which could potentially be used by millions of people around the world [3] . In addition to its potential use as a means of exchange, Bitcoin may also serve as a platform for other applications [4] . For example, one can imagine a system where users pay each other directly via Bitcoins without having to rely on third parties like banks or credit card companies [5] . Another possible application would involve storing Bitcoins in cold storage [6] so they are not vulnerable to theft or loss due to hacking attacks [7, 8] . Finally, Bitcoin transactions might even be used to settle financial contracts [9] . Despite all of these exciting possibilities, however, little academic research has been done on Bitcoin itself [10] . Most existing studies focus instead on related topics such as mining [11] , price prediction [12] , transaction processing [13] , and security [14] .",1,0
"We present new results on the outer jets of the symbiotic star, R Aqr (=V1016 Cyg). We have analyzed archival Chandra data obtained between 1999 August 31 and 2000 September 30 as well as XMM-Newton observations taken between 2001 October 24 and 2002 November 3. The analysis shows that both jets are still active at least up to 2004 January 1. In addition we report on an optical spectroscopic campaign carried out with the Nordic Optical Telescope during 2003 December 10-17 which revealed no significant changes compared to previous campaigns. Finally, we discuss our findings within the context of current models for the formation of bipolar nebulae around evolved stars.

"In this thesis we study the problem of optimizing resource allocation in wireless networks by using non-cooperative game theory. We consider three different problems: (1) Code Optimization, (2) Power Control, and (3) Receiver Design. In each case, we formulate an optimization problem as a noncooperative game between users competing to maximize their own utility functions. Then, we propose distributed algorithms that converge to Nash equilibria of these games. Finally, we evaluate our proposed schemes through extensive simulations on both static and mobile scenarios.Keywords: Non-Cooperative Game Theory; Wireless Networks; Resource Allocation; Distributed Algorithms; Nash Equilibrium. 1 IntroductionThe rapid growth of wireless communication has led to increased demand for high quality services such as voice over IP (VoIP), video streaming, online gaming etc., which require efficient use of limited resources available at base stations or access points. To meet this growing demand, researchers have been working towards developing new techniques to improve the performance of existing wireless systems while maintaining low cost and energy consumption [1] . One promising approach is to optimize resource allocations among users in order to increase overall system throughput [2] , reduce interference [3] , minimize transmission delay [4] , and/or enhance fairness [5] .The main challenge faced when designing resource allocation strategies lies in the fact that there are usually multiple conflicting objectives [6] . For example, maximizing total user satisfaction may lead to unfair distribution of resources across users [7]; increasing spectral efficiency can cause severe inter-user interference [8] ; minimizing transmission delays may result in poor channel utilization [9] . Therefore, it becomes necessary to develop novel approaches that strike a balance between various conflicting goals [10] .This work was supported in part by NSF under Grants CNS-0721440, CCF-0729260, ECCS-0801571, and CNS-0916275.",1,0
"We present an experimental investigation into complementarity between position and momentum measurements on single photons using a modified version of the original Einstein-Bohr photon box experiment.The results show that, for this particular measurement scheme, there is no violation of Bell's inequality or any other form of nonlocality. We also demonstrate how our setup can be used to investigate quantum contextuality by performing two different experiments with identical settings but opposite outcomes. In one case we observe violations of Bell inequalities while in the other they are not violated. This shows that the observed behavior cannot be explained within classical physics and demonstrates quantum contextuality. Quantum mechanics predicts that certain physical quantities such as position and momentum do not have simultaneous well-defined values. Instead these quantities exist only as probability distributions which evolve continuously over time according to Schrödinger's equation. However, it has been shown that if both position and momentum were measured simultaneously then their respective probabilities would interfere destructively resulting in a zero probability of measuring either quantity at its most probable value [1] . This phenomenon known as Heisenberg uncertainty principle leads to the concept of complementarity: the impossibility of observing all properties of a system simultaneously [2] . In 1964 John Bell showed that local hidden variable theories could not explain some predictions made by quantum mechanics [3] , leading to the formulation of Bell's theorem [4] . Since then many experiments have been performed to test whether quantum mechanical predictions violate Bell's theorem [5] . These tests typically involve entangled particles [6] where each particle carries information about the state of another distant particle [7, 8] . If the particles are separated far enough so that they never interact again after being created, then the correlations between them must be due solely to quantum effects [9] .",1,0
"We present new experimental results on the relaxation dynamics of a liquid film that is pulled off an inclined solid substrate by gravity and capillarity. The experiments are performed in a microgravity environment aboard the International Space Station (ISS). We find that, for sufficiently large pulling speeds, the relaxation process can be described as a succession of three stages. In stage I, the contact angle decreases rapidly to its equilibrium value at which point the contact line stops moving. Stage II starts when the contact line has stopped moving; during this stage, the contact angle remains constant while the height profile of the free surface continues evolving towards its final shape. Finally, in stage III, the contact angle increases again until it reaches its initial value. This behavior is explained using a simple model based on lubrication theory. Our analysis shows that the relaxation time scales with the inverse of the pulling speed. For small pulling speeds, we observe deviations from our theoretical predictions due to inertial effects.Liquid films play important roles in many natural phenomena such as rain drops falling down a window or water evaporating into air. Dewetting processes occur frequently in nature but also have applications in industrial processes like coating technologies where thin films need to be removed from substrates. Understanding how these systems evolve over time requires knowledge about their relaxation dynamics after they have been perturbed out of equilibrium. Here, we study experimentally the relaxation of a liquid film that was pulled off an inclined solid wall by gravity and capillary forces.",1,0
"We present the results of an analysis of Chandra observations of two nearby radio-quiet quasars, PG 1211+143 and Mrk 335 (z=0.034). We find that both sources show evidence for significant variability on timescales as short as hours to days. The observed flux changes are consistent with those expected if these objects have relativistic jets which precess around their axes at small angles to our line-of-sight. In addition we detect rapid flaring activity in the soft X-rays during one observation of each source. This is most likely due to thermal instabilities within the accretion disk. Finally, we discuss how this behaviour may be used to diagnose whether or not an active galactic nucleus has a dominant jet component.

"We study the curve flows associated with nonholonomic solitonic hierarchies in terms of nonlinear connections (N-connections) on fiber bundles, which are generated by horizontal lifts of vector fields along curves. We show that these N-connection structures can be derived as solutions to certain classes of generalized Einstein equations for metrics depending on higher order derivatives of time variables. The corresponding geometric objects are defined by using the so-called anholonomy coefficients of N-connections. In particular, we consider the case when the base manifold is an arbitrary smooth n-dimensional Riemannian space (M^n,g) equipped with a family of local coordinates x^μ = (x^1,..., x^n). Then any point p∈ M^n has its natural coordinate neighborhood U_p⊂ M^n such that all points q∈ U_p have their own sets of coordinates x̅_q = x̅^̅1̅_q, ...,x̅_n_q related to each other via some diffeomorphism Φ_q : U_p→ V_q⊂ℝ^n+1. This allows us to define the following class of metric tensors on (M^n, g):G_αβ(x) := g_αβ + ∑_q=1^n h^q_αβ(x, x̅_q) where h^q_αβ(p, x̅_q) are functions of two arguments satisfying certain conditions. These conditions guarantee that the tensor field G_αβ defines a pseudo-Riemannian metric on M.",1,0
"We consider the motion of an incompressible, inviscid fluid in two dimensions under the influence of gravity and surface tension. The flow is assumed to be irrotational except for a finite number of singularities at which point vorticity may accumulate. We show that if the initial data are sufficiently small then there exists a unique global solution whose velocity field has only one component along each line parallel to the x-axis. This result generalizes previous results on two-dimensional flows by allowing more complicated wave patterns such as those generated by water waves or nonlinear optics.Keywords: Fluids; Vortices; Water waves; Nonlinear optics. 1 IntroductionIn this work we study the dynamics of fluids governed by the Euler equations in two space dimensions. Our main goal is to prove existence of solutions having certain special properties. More precisely, let us assume that the initial velocity field u0(x) = (u0x(x), u0y(x)) satisfies the following conditions:",1,0
"We present near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy of the black hole X-ray binary system A0620-00 obtained with the Subaru Telescope and Gemini Observatory in 2001-2002. The NIR spectrum shows strong emission lines originating from highly ionized species such as FeXXV-XXVI, NeIX-XI, MgXI-XII, SiXIV-XVII, SXV-XXIII, ArXVIII-XXIV, CaXIX-XXVIII, and NiXXI-XXIV. We find that these features are well reproduced by our photoionization model calculations for an accretion disk irradiated by hard X-rays emitted from the central source. In addition to the above mentioned ions, we also detect absorption lines due to neutral hydrogen and helium at wavelengths longer than 1 micron. These absorptions originate from the interstellar medium along the line-of-sight toward this object.Keywords: Near-infrared spectroscopy",1,0
"We present the results of high-resolution numerical simulations of compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in periodic boxes with different sizes and resolutions, ranging from (2^10∼ 2^12)^3 to (4^10∼ 4^12)^3 grid points at resolution levels between 64 3 and 512 3 . We find that the scaling relations for kinetic energy spectra are consistent with those predicted by Kolmogorov's theory when normalized appropriately.The magnetic field spectrum follows a power law over several decades in wavenumber space, but deviates significantly from the prediction of idealized MHD turbulence theories such as Iroshnikov-Kraichnan or Goldreich-Sridhar models. In addition, we show that the anisotropy of velocity fluctuations is negligible compared to that of magnetic fields. Finally, we demonstrate that our simulation data can be used to test theoretical predictions on the statistics of Alfvénic modes.",1,0
"We report on the detection and analysis of giant pulses (GPs) from the Crab pulsar using data recorded with the MWA-LFD prototype system at frequencies between 80 and 240 MHz. The GPs are detected by searching for excess power in short time intervals, which is then compared to that expected from background noise fluctuations. We find that the number of GP candidates increases as we lower the frequency below 150 MHz. This increase can be explained if the emission mechanism responsible for producing GPs has an intrinsic spectral index steeper than -1.5. In addition, we show that the pulse width distribution changes significantly when going from high to low radio frequencies. Finally, we present results showing how the flux density of individual GPs varies across our observing bandwidth. These observations provide new insights into the physical processes occurring within the magnetosphere of this energetic pulsar. Keywords: Radio astronomy, Pulsar",1,0
"We present new observations in the mid-infrared (MIR) and near-infrared (NIR), as well as archival data, to study the physical conditions of the gas surrounding the young stellar object Re 4 IRS located at the center of the reflection nebula NGC 1333 IRAS 2. We find that the MIR spectrum is dominated by strong ro-vibrational lines of H_2O and CO, while the NIR spectrum shows prominent Brackett-γ line emission with an equivalent width of1 Å. The observed fluxes are consistent with those expected for a T Tauri star surrounded by a dense circumstellar disk heated by accretion shocks. In addition, we detect several forbidden transitions of [Fe II] , [S III] , [N II] , and [C II] . These results suggest that the central source has recently undergone a burst of enhanced mass loss activity which may be related to its recent transition into the main sequence phase.",1,0
"We have investigated charge injection capability (CIC) of Suzaku X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (XIS). The CIC is an important feature for high energy resolution spectroscopy, which can be used to reduce the effect of pile-up in bright sources and improve the spectral quality at low energies. We performed detailed analysis on the performance of CIC by using Crab observations with different count rates. By comparing the results obtained with and without CIC we found that CIC improves the spectral fitting significantly especially below 1 keV where the pile-up fraction becomes large when the source flux increases. This improvement was confirmed also by analyzing simulated data generated by xisrmfgen and xissimarfgen. Finally, we applied this method to analyze the observation of Mrk 421 during its flare state. We successfully detected emission lines such as O VII Kα line and Fe XXV Kα line from the spectrum taken with CIC enabled.These results show that CIC works well even under strong pile-up conditions.",1,0
"We propose to use the time evolution of cosmological redshifts in order to probe the nature of dark energy, which is one of the most important problems in modern physics and astronomy. We show that this method can be used for testing various models of dark energy by using only two parameters (the present-day values of Hubble constant H0 and deceleration parameter q0). The proposed method does not require any additional information about the universe beyond what we already know today. This makes it possible to perform an independent check on the results obtained with other methods such as supernovae Ia observations or cosmic microwave background anisotropy measurements. In particular, our analysis shows that the current data are consistent with the standard ΛCDM model at 1σ level but do not rule out some alternative models like quintessence or phantom fields. Finally, we discuss how future surveys could improve the constraints on these models. Cosmological redshifts play an important role in modern astrophysics and cosmology because they provide us with valuable information about the expansion history of the Universe. However, their interpretation requires knowledge of the underlying theory describing the dynamics of space-time. For example, if we assume general relativity then cosmological redshifts can be interpreted as due to the Doppler effect caused by the recession velocities of distant galaxies [1] . On the other hand, if we consider modified gravity theories then cosmological redshifting may have different physical origins [2] . In recent years there has been growing interest in studying the possibility of probing the nature of dark energy through its effects on cosmological redshifts [3] - [8] . Dark energy is currently believed to dominate the content of the Universe [9] , however its exact origin remains unknown [10] . It is usually described within the framework of Einstein's field equations by introducing a new component into the stress-energy tensor [11] . Its presence leads to accelerated expansion of the Universe [12] , which manifests itself in the form of observed...",1,0
"We present spectroscopic redshifts for Lyman alpha emission-line galaxies (LAEs) selected with narrow-band imaging data taken by Subaru/Suprime-Cam and VLT/VIMOS on the basis of their strong rest-frame ultraviolet emission lines, including Ly-alpha line.

This value agrees well with that estimated from photometric redshifts based on multi-band optical-to-infrared SEDs constructed from deep ground-based observations as well as those derived from Spitzer/MIPS 24 micron fluxes. Our sample consists of two sub-samples; one has been observed only once while another was observed twice or more times. No significant difference between these samples are seen except for the fraction of objects showing double peaks in their Ly-alpha profiles.",1,0
We present the first results on two massive binary systems with periods longer than 100 days that are potential targets for future space-based optical interferometers such as SIM or TPF-I. The primary stars in these binaries have masses between 8 to 12 Msun and their companions are less massive (1-5 Msun). We used high resolution spectroscopy obtained at McDonald Observatory to determine orbital parameters for both systems. In addition we determined stellar atmospheric properties using photometric data taken by Hipparcos satellite and spectroscopic observations made at McDonald Observatory. Our analysis shows that the components of HD 37362 system are very similar while those of HD 54672 differ significantly. This is consistent with our expectations based on evolutionary models which predict that the more massive star will evolve faster and become redder. These results demonstrate that it may be possible to use astrometric measurements combined with radial velocity curves to measure directly mass loss rates due to winds driven by radiation pressure.,1,0

"We study the effect of 'illusion of control' on minority games with different number of players, as well as on Parrondo's paradoxical games. We show that for all these cases there is an optimal value of illusion of control which maximizes the performance of the system. The results are obtained by using numerical simulations based on Monte Carlo method. In particular we find that the optimal values of illusion of control depend strongly on the number of players involved in each game.I. INTRODUCTIO NA. Illusion of Control (IC) The term 'illusion of control' was first introduced by Langer [1] . It refers to situations where people tend to overestimate their ability to influence events or outcomes [2] , even when they have no real control [3] . In recent years this concept has been applied to many fields such as: gambling [4] , stock markets [5] , sports [6] , health [7] , education [8] etc., showing its importance in human behavior [9] - [11] . B. Minority Game (MG) MGs were proposed by Challet and Zhang [12] as models of financial markets. They consist of agents who make decisions according to some strategy at discrete time steps. At every step one agent makes a decision among two options, called spin-up and spindown. If more than half of the agents choose the same option then it wins; otherwise it loses. Agents can change their strategies during the course of play [13] . There exist several variants of MGs: single-agent [14] , multi-agent [15] , continuous-time [16] , quantum [17] , evolutionary [18] , co-evolutionary [19] , spatially extended [20] , and others [21] - [23] . C. Parrondo's Paradoxical Games (PPGs) Parrondo's paradoxical games [24] are simple two-player games played between a player A and B [25] . Each player plays against his opponent with a certain probability p i = 1 − q i , where 0 < p i , q i ≤ 1 [26] . When both players use the same strategy s i ∈ −1, 1, the expected return per round is zero [27] . However if",1,0
"We consider the information-theoretic limit theorems (CLTs) for linear spectral statistics of large dimensional Gram random matrices, which are defined as follows.Let (X_1,…, X_n) be an iid sequence of zero-mean complex Gaussian vectors in ℂ^d and let Y=XX^* denote its covariance matrix. We assume that the distribution of X is invariant under unitary transformations on each coordinate axis. Then we define the Gram random matrix G_n byG_n = Y^1/2Y^1/2 where Y^1/2 denotes the square root of Y. The main purpose of this work is to establish central limit theorems for linear spectral statistics of the form ∑_j=1^n f_j(λ_j), where λ_j's are the eigenvalues of G and f_j's are functions satisfying some regularity conditions. In particular, we show that if f has bounded variation then the limiting distribution of ∑_j=0^n f_j(λ_i) can be expressed explicitly using the Stieltjes transform of the Marchenko-Pastur law.",1,0
"We have studied thermally unstable accretion disks by using an adaptive pseudo-spectral domain decomposition method (PSDDM). We found that limit-cycles appear when the viscosity is moderate, and they are suppressed as the viscosity decreases. The results obtained here agree well with those reported previously for non-adaptive PSDDMs.Keywords: black hole, disk instability, limit cycle, spectral methods, viscous flow1 IntroductionIn recent years there has been considerable interest in studying the nonlinear behavior of thermally unstable accretion flows onto black holes because such instabilities may be responsible for some observed phenomena associated with active galactic nuclei (AGNs) or quasars [1, 2] . For example, it was suggested that the rapid variability of AGNs/quasars could result from thermal-viscous instabilities [3 -5] , which can lead to limit cycles [6] . However, previous studies on this subject were limited mainly due to computational difficulties [7 -9] .In order to overcome these difficulties we developed recently an adaptive pseudospectral domain decomposition method (APSDDM), which allows us to study numerically the nonlinear evolution of thermally unstable accretions more efficiently than before [10, 11] . Using APSDDM we investigated the effects of various physical parameters on the nonlinear evolution of thermallly unstable accretion disks [11] . It turned out that the effect of magnetic fields on the nonlinear evolution depends strongly on their strength; while weak magnetic fields tend to enhance the growth rate of the limit-cycle amplitude, strong ones suppress them [12] .In this work we continue our investigation into the nonlinear evolution of thermaly unstable accretion disks by considering the case where the viscosity parameter α = 0.1. This value of α corresponds roughly to the situation expected at distances of about 10 Schwarzschild radii from the central black hole [13] .",1,0
"We present the results of an analysis of high-resolution optical spectra obtained with the Subaru Telescope for a sample of young, low-mass (0.5-2 Msun) PMS stars in Orion Nebula Cluster. We find that most of these objects show significant periodic variability on timescales ranging between 1 day to several months. The observed periods are consistent with those expected if the photometric variations result from rotational modulation due to starspots and/or plages. In addition we detect strong Hα emission lines which indicate chromospheric activity. Our observations suggest that many of our targets have relatively rapid rotation rates compared to older field dwarfs at similar masses. This is likely caused by tidal locking during their formation process. Finally, we also report the detection of two new spectroscopic binaries among our target list. These systems will be useful as benchmarks for testing theoretical models of binary evolution.",1,0
"We present new photometric observations in the visible range for five faint irregular satellites of Uranus (Sycorax, Prospero,Stephano, Setebos; Trinculo) obtained with the 1-m telescope at the South African Astronomical Observatory during two observing runs on September 24-25th 2010 and March 28-29th 2011. The data were reduced using standard procedures within IRAF. We used aperture photometry to extract magnitudes of these objects relative to comparison stars observed simultaneously.These results are presented together with previously published light-curves and colour indices. All our measurements are consistent with previous ones but we have significantly improved their accuracy by reducing systematic errors due to atmospheric conditions or instrumental effects. Our analysis shows that all five satellites exhibit very similar behaviour - they are redder than predicted by models of irradiated icy bodies and show no significant phase variations over several years. This suggests that they may be covered by dark material which is not exposed directly to solar radiation.",1,0
"The authors describe how they have created an artificial life form that self-assembles into a structure similar to the fruiting body of the Dictyostelium discoideum, or 'dictyos' for short.The dictyos is made up of thousands of identical cells connected by elastic filaments and can be grown in Petri dishes with nutrients added.It has been shown to grow and divide indefinitely without any external control signals (such as hormones).This work was done at Harvard University's Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering.... Self-assembly refers to the spontaneous organization of matter into ordered structures such as crystals, snowflakes, and living organisms like bacteria colonies and animal tissues. In this study we report on our efforts toward creating a synthetic multicellular system capable of autonomous growth and division through self-assembly. We designed a minimal cell based on a spherical water-in-oil emulsion droplet containing a single microtubule-based cytoskeleton surrounded by a lipid membrane. These cells are able to attach to each other via flexible polymeric tethers and assemble into three-dimensional aggregates called “dictyos” which resemble the fruiting bodies formed by the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoidium.

"We present the results of an infrared survey of the Galactic plane using Spitzer/InfraRed Array Camera (IRAC) data in four mid-infrared bands centered at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8 microns. The IRAC observations cover about one third of the entire sky with |b| < 1 degree. We have identified more than 100 thousand candidate young stellar objects (YSOs), including both Class 0/I YSOs and Classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs). About half of these are associated with previously known star-forming regions or open clusters. Most of them show extended emission around their central cores which is likely to be due to circumstellar disks and/or envelopes. A large fraction of our sample shows bipolar morphology indicative of outflows driven by accretion onto the central star(s). The spatial distribution of the newly discovered YSO candidates suggests that most of the recent massive star formation has occurred within the last few million years along the spiral arms of the Galaxy.",1,0
"We present new spectroscopic observations for the open cluster NGC 1883, which is located at a distance of about 1 kpc in the constellation Cassiopeia (α = 20 h 18 m , δ = +58°). The data were obtained with the 2-m telescope of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional de San Pedro Mártir (OAN-SPM) on December 16-17, 2009 using the REOSC spectrograph equipped with grism #7 covering the wavelength range 3700-7000 Å. We measured RVs for 23 stars by cross-correlating their spectra against those of template dwarfs observed under similar conditions. Our results show that most of these objects have heliocentric velocities between -40 to -50 km/sec, while only two stars are found outside this interval. These values agree well with previous determinations based on photometric methods.In addition we derived metallicities [Fe/H] for 14 stars using the calibration of Alonso et al. (1999) . For all but one star our measurements indicate solar or slightly subsolar metallicities ranging from -0.10 dex up to +0.20 dex.

"We propose to use thermal noise as the information carrier for totally secure communications, zero power consumption devices, and computing systems. We show that by using an appropriate detection scheme, we can extract digital bits from the thermal noise with high fidelity at room temperature. The proposed system is based on a single-electron transistor (SET) which has been demonstrated in experiments recently. In addition, we demonstrate how this SET-based device can be used to perform logic operations such as AND gate and NOT gate. Finally, we discuss possible applications of our proposal including quantum key distribution, ultra-low power sensor networks, and energy efficient data centers. This work was supported by NSF under Grant No. ECCS-0926491. A new paradigm called 'thermal noise informatics' is introduced where thermal noise is utilized as the information carrier for various tasks ranging from totally secure communication over wires to zero-power communication and computation. By employing an appropriate detection scheme, it is shown that one can extract digital bits from thermal noise with high fidelities even at room temperatures. It is also shown that these extracted digital bits can be used to perform logical operations such as AND gates and NOT gates. Possible applications are discussed along with their advantages compared to existing technologies.",1,0
"We present the theory for macroscopic quantum tunneling (MQT) in high-temperature superconductors with an emphasis on its application to c-axis junctions. We show that MQT is suppressed by thermal fluctuations and magnetic field, but can be enhanced by applying a bias current or increasing the junction area. The results are compared with experiments performed at 4 K and 77 K. In particular we find good agreement between our theoretical predictions and experimental data obtained recently on YBa2Cu3O7-x single crystals.IntroductionSuperconductivity was discovered more than half a century ago [1] . Since then many new materials have been found which exhibit this fascinating phenomenon [2] , including some with very high transition temperatures T_c [3] . However, despite intensive research efforts there still remain several open questions about the nature of these novel compounds [4] . One such question concerns the mechanism responsible for their unusual properties [5] .It has been suggested [6] that the pairing interaction may involve phonons [7 - 9] as well as spin excitations [10 - 12] . This leads to two possible scenarios for the formation of Cooper pairs [13] : either they form directly out of electrons via electron-phonon interactions [14] , or indirectly through spin-fluctuations [15] . These different mechanisms lead to distinct physical pictures [16] . For example, if one assumes that the pairing occurs only due to electron-phonon interactions [17] , it follows that the gap function should vanish along certain lines in momentum space [18] . On the other hand, if one considers the possibility of pair formation mediated by spin fluctuations [19] , the gap function vanishes over all momenta [20] .The most important feature of both types of models is that they predict the existence of nodes [21] in the energy spectrum [22] . Nodes occur when the order parameter changes sign across the Fermi surface [23] . They were first predicted theoretically [24 - 26] and later observed experimentally [27] .",1,0
"We present evidence for dark matter annihilation in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) haze, which is an excess emission at large angles with respect to the Galactic center that was first detected by Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). We use data from Planck and Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT), as well as new measurements of the CMB temperature anisotropies made using the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). The observed spectrum of this signal can be explained if it originates from dark matter particles with masses between 1 GeV and 10 TeV, annihilating into pairs of photons or leptons. This interpretation requires a boost factor of about 100 relative to standard thermal relic expectations.If confirmed, our results would provide strong support for models where dark matter self-annihilates into Standard Model particles. They also have important implications on the nature of dark matter itself, since they require either non-thermal production mechanisms or additional interactions beyond those predicted within the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model.",1,0
"We study the effective anisotropy constants, Keff , of an assembly of identical spherical particles in which each particle has uniaxial anisotropy along its easy axis (EA) that is tilted by an angle θ relative to the applied field direction. We show that for small values of θ, Keff can be written as a sum of two terms: one term proportional to sin2θ arising due to dipolar interactions between the particles; another term independent of θ arising due to the shape anisotropy of individual particles. For large values of θ, we find that Keff decreases rapidly with increasing θ because of the reduction in the number density of particles having their EA parallel to H. The dependence of Keff on θ is found to agree well with experimental results obtained recently for FePt nanoparticles.In this work, we also calculate the activation energies associated with reversal processes involving rotation about different axes of the nanoparticle. It turns out that these activation energies are strongly dependent upon the value of θ.",1,0
"We show that correlation clustering is NP-hard to approximate within any constant factor, even for graphs with maximum degree three and clusters of size at most four.We also present an algorithm which solves this problem exactly in time O(n3). Our results are based on reductions from the exact cover by 3-sets (X3C) problem. The X3C problem asks whether there exists a collection of subsets of a set S such that each element of S belongs to exactly 3 sets in the collection; it has been shown to be NP-complete. For more information about our work see  .Correlation clustering is one of several problems studied under the umbrella of 'clustering'; these include k-means clustering, spectral clustering, and graph partitioning. It was introduced independently by Bansal et al., Blum et al., and Dasgupta et al. as follows.Given a weighted undirected graph G = (V, E), where V denotes the vertices and E denotes the edges, we say that two vertices u, v ∈ V are adjacent if they share an edge e ∈ E. A cluster C ⊆ V is defined as a subset of nodes whose pairwise distances satisfy some threshold t > 0. More formally, given a distance function d : V × V → R+ , let dist(u,v) denote the shortest path between u and v; then, C is said to be a valid cluster if and only if for all pairs of nodes u, v ∈ C:dist(u,v)≤ t",1,0
"The character rings of classical groups are studied in this article, and their Hopf algebra structures are determined by using the results on the representation theory of finite groups obtained recently. The main result is that if G is an abelian group with order nn, then the character ring K[G]K[G]has a Hopf algebra structure whose comultiplication map ΔΔ satisfies (1) Δ(g)(h)=Σi=1n[g−ih]/(n−1)! for all g∈G, h∈G, (2) Δ(gh)=gΔ(h)+hΔ(g), and (3) Δ(e)=e for e∈G. In particular, we have shown that the character ring of any cyclic group CcC_c has a Hopf algebra strucutre satisfying these conditions. We also give some examples to show how our method works.",1,0
"We study the phenomenology of string compactifications with large extra dimensions, focusing on supersymmetric particles in the mass range accessible to current experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We consider two classes of models that are motivated by recent developments in string theory: weakly coupled heterotic orbifolds and strongly coupled Type IIB orientifold constructions. In both cases we find that there is an interesting interplay between the Kaluza-Klein excitations associated with the extra dimensions and the lightest Standard Model superpartners. For example, in some regions of parameter space it may be possible to produce gluinos or squarks directly via Drell-Yan processes; alternatively, these states can decay into lighter Standard Model superpartners which then cascade down to the LSP neutralino. The resulting collider signatures depend sensitively on the details of the underlying model parameters as well as the number of extra dimensions.",1,0
"We study the cosmology of modified gravity models with an action that contains higher-order curvature terms, such as R^2 and R_μνρσ. We show how to derive constraints on these theories using observations of large-scale structure (LSS), cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB), supernovae Ia (SNeIa), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), Hubble constant measurements (HST), and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). In particular we consider two classes of models: those in which the gravitational field equations are fourth order in derivatives; and those where they are second order but contain extra degrees of freedom beyond the usual massless graviton. For both cases we find that current data is consistent with general relativity at the level of one part in 10^6 or better. However, future experiments may be able to detect deviations from GR if they exist.Keywords: Modified Gravity",1,0
"We consider the problem of recovering an unknown signal on a domain Ω by observing noisy measurements at some locations in Ω, where the noise is assumed to be additive white Gaussian with variance σ^2.We show that if the number of observations scales as O(n^1/3) then it is possible to recover the signal exactly using convex optimization techniques (where n denotes the total number of pixels). This result improves upon previous results which required O(n^2/3) samples for exact recovery. The proof relies on recent developments in probabilistic potential theory and the so-called 'Dobrushin uniqueness theorems'. Our analysis also shows how one can use this framework to obtain guarantees under more general conditions than those considered previously.The main idea behind our approach is to view the reconstruction process as a statistical estimation problem over a probability space equipped with a Gibbs measure. In particular, we introduce a new notion called 'local observability' which quantifies the amount of information contained within each observation about the underlying signal.",1,0
"We present an approximate theory to study the effect of a magnetic field on the ground state properties and phase diagram of strongly correlated systems, such as high-Tc cuprates or heavy fermion compounds. The starting point is the exact diagonalization (ED) of small clusters with periodic boundary conditions at zero temperature. We use Lanczos ED method to calculate the energy spectrum of these clusters. Then we construct a variational wave function by projecting this cluster eigenstates onto a set of single-particle orbitals obtained within density functional theory (DFT). This allows us to obtain accurate results even when using only very few DFT states per orbital. Finally, we perform Monte Carlo simulations based on the Gutzwiller projected BCS wave functions to investigate the thermodynamic behavior of our system. Our main result shows that the application of a magnetic field leads to a suppression of the superfluid order parameter ψ which can be understood as a consequence of the Zeeman splitting between spin-up and -down electrons.",1,0
"We present the results of our analysis of a sample of 25 high-resolution quasar absorption line systems with metallicities ranging between 1/100 and 1/10 solar, selected to have low dust content (i.e., < 0.1 mag extinction at 2200 A). We use these data together with those for another 20 DLAs presented by Pettini et al. (1999) to investigate the chemical enrichment history of DLA galaxies over cosmic time. The main conclusions are as follows:The abundance patterns observed in this sample can be explained if we assume that most of the metals were produced during an early burst of star formation which occurred less than 10 Gyr ago.This is consistent with previous studies based on smaller samples but it also shows that there may not always be evidence for recent star formation activity even when such activity has been inferred from other indicators.In addition, we find no correlation between metallicity and dust content or neutral hydrogen column density.Finally, we show that the mean value of [Fe/H] measured in DLAs agrees well with the predictions made using simple models of galactic chemical evolution.",1,0
"In this work, we propose an adaptive service provisioning scheme to provide quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees and maximize the network utility by jointly optimizing resource allocation at both base stations (BSs) and mobile users (MUs). The proposed scheme is based on a communication model that incorporates user mobility into the QoS requirements. We formulate the problem as a joint optimization over BSs' power control variables, MUs' transmission rates, and their association with BSs. To solve it efficiently, we first decompose the original problem into two subproblems: one for each BS and another for all MUs. Then, we develop distributed algorithms to obtain solutions to these problems iteratively using dual decomposition techniques. Finally, simulation results show that our proposed algorithm can achieve better performance than existing schemes under various system settings. In recent years, wireless networks have been widely deployed around the world due to their low cost and easy deployment [1] . However, they are vulnerable to security attacks such as eavesdropping [2] , jamming [3] , and data tampering [4] . To enhance the security level of wireless communications, physical layer security has attracted much attention recently [5] - [8] . Physical layer security exploits the characteristics of the wireless channel to ensure secure transmissions without relying on any additional cryptographic keys or protocols [9] . It was shown in [10] that if the legitimate transmitter-receiver pair shares no common information about the statistical properties of the channels between them and other potential eavesdroppers, then perfect secrecy cannot be achieved even when there exists infinite number of antennas at the transmitter side. Therefore, practical approaches should consider imperfections in the estimation process [11] , limited transmit power [12] , and finite antenna numbers [13] .",1,0
"We study the non-Markovian evolution of bipartite Gaussian states under local dephasing noise and global squeezing interaction with an environment at finite temperature. We show that, for any initial state, there exists a critical time beyond which the system becomes separable. The critical time is determined by the initial state's purity and the environmental temperature. For pure initial states, we find that the critical time decreases monotonically as the temperature increases; while it first decreases then increases when the initial state has mixedness. In addition to this general result, we also present some specific examples where the critical times are analytically obtained. Our results provide useful insights into the effect of environmental temperature on the entanglement dynamics of open quantum systems. Introduction:-Entangled states play important roles in many fields such as quantum information processing [1] , condensed matter physics [2] , and quantum optics [3] . It is well known that the presence of external environments can lead to the loss of entanglement [4] . Therefore, understanding how the entanglement evolves in noisy environments is crucially important both theoretically and experimentally [5] . In recent years, much attention has been paid to studying the entanglement dynamics of quantum systems [6] - [8] . However, most previous works have focused only on Markovian processes [9] - [11] or special types of initial states [12] - [14] . Recently, several authors studied the entanglement dynamics of two-mode Gaussian states [15] - [17] . They found that the entanglement decays exponentially fast if one mode undergoes phase damping (or amplitude damping) [18] ; however, it may decay slowly even though the other mode experiences strong dissipation [19] . Moreover, they showed that the entanglement revival occurs periodically [20] . These studies were mainly based on numerical simulations [21] . Very recently, analytical solutions were presented [22] - [24] . Nevertheless, these investigations did not take into account the effects of environmental temperatures [25] - [27] .",1,0
"We report on measurements of the spin polarization in the ferromagnetic semiconductor EuS using two different spectroscopies, namely zero-field (ZF) and Zeeman split Andreev reflection (ZSAR). The ZF technique is based on measuring the conductance through an interface between a normal metal and a ferromagnet as function of the angle between magnetization directions of both materials. In contrast to this method we use the ZSAR technique which allows us to measure directly the spin polarization at the Fermi level by applying a small external field parallel to the sample surface. We find that for low temperatures below 10 K the results obtained by these techniques are consistent within experimental error bars. However, above T = 10 K there is a significant discrepancy between the values determined by the two methods. This may be explained by assuming that the temperature dependence of the spin polarization has a non-monotonic behavior. Our findings demonstrate that the combination of ZF and ZSAR experiments can provide valuable information about the electronic structure of ferromagnets.",1,0
"We study the properties of type-D Einstein metrics on compact manifolds with boundary, and their relation to supersymmetric solutions of supergravity theories. We show that these spaces are characterized by an integrable complex structure J which is compatible with the metric g and satisfies certain additional conditions at the boundary. In particular we prove that if (M n ,g) is such a space then there exists a unique spinor field ψ satisfying (D_μψ)^α = 0 for all α∈Γ_n where D_μ = ∂_μ + iA^μ is the Dirac operator associated to the connection A = dg - J∧d. Moreover this spinor field has constant norm and defines a Killing vector field X = ψ^*ψ whose flow preserves both g and J.The existence of such a spinor field implies that the scalar curvature R_g of the metric vanishes identically. Conversely, any solution of the vacuum Einstein equations with vanishing scalar curvature can be written as a warped product over a flat base manifold times a Riemannian Einstein solvmanifold. This result generalizes previous results obtained in dimension four by Bryant and Salamon [BS] .",1,0
"We study the G-convergence for nonlinear viscoelastic flows in bounded domains with smooth boundaries, where the constitutive relation is given by an integral-type equation. We prove that if the sequence of solutions to the corresponding problems converges weakly* in L^∞(0,T;L^2) then it also converges strongly in L^1(0,T;H^-1). As applications we consider two examples of such equations. The first one is the Oldroyd-B model which describes the flow behavior of polymeric fluids. In this case our results show that the limit problem can be formulated as a system of partial differential equations coupled through the stress tensor. The second example deals with the so-called Maxwell fluid whose relaxation time depends on the shear rate. Here we obtain a new formulation of the limit problem involving only ordinary differential equations. Finally, we present some numerical experiments illustrating these theoretical results.

"We have used data obtained by the DIRBE instrument on board the COBE satellite to determine the far-infrared cosmic background (CIB) at wavelengths between 1.25 mm and 240 m, which is dominated by emission lines from interstellar atomic hydrogen. We find that the CIB intensity in this wavelength range can be described as a power law with an index of -2.6 +/- 0.1. The total energy density of the CIB integrated over all wavelengths longer than 100 microns amounts to about 5 x 10(-3). This value agrees well with previous estimates based on IRAS observations but it is significantly higher than values derived from recent ISO measurements. Our results are consistent with theoretical predictions for the contribution of dusty galaxies to the CIB. They also provide new constraints on models describing the formation of structure in the universe.Keywords: infrared radiation; cosmology; galaxy evolution; intergalactic medium",1,0
"We study the dynamical stability properties of rapidly-rotating, axisymmetric neutron star models with different equations of state (EOS). We find that for all EOS considered here, there is an instability associated to the presence of toroidal magnetic fields which can be excited by differential rotation between core and crust regions. The growth timescale of this instability ranges from 10-100 ms depending on the strength of the field and the degree of differential rotation present initially.This instability may have important consequences for magnetar flares as well as for the spin evolution of young pulsars. In particular we show how it could lead to rapid spindowns during the first few hundred milliseconds after birth if the initial conditions are such that the unstable mode has a large enough amplitude. Finally, we discuss possible observational signatures of these instabilities. Dynamical non-axisymmetric modes in rapidly-rotating relativistic stars",1,0
"We have investigated how different assumptions about the velocity distribution function (VDF) affect the shape of the observed line profile in the solar corona, using an analytical model for the VDF that includes both isotropic thermal motions and anisotropic nonthermal motions. We find that the inclusion of nonthermal motions can significantly alter the shapes of the simulated line profiles compared with those obtained assuming purely Maxwellian distributions. The effects are more pronounced when the plasma temperature decreases and/or the degree of anisotropy increases.In particular, we show that the presence of nonthermal motions leads to significant asymmetries between the red-and blueshifted wings of the line profiles. These results suggest that it may be possible to use observations of coronal lines to constrain the properties of the underlying VDFs. However, this requires accurate measurements of the Doppler shifts associated with each emission feature along the line-of-sight.",1,0
"The thermal stability and melting behavior of metallic single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are investigated by using an efficient tight-binding molecular dynamics simulation method with the Tersoff potential function. The results show that SWCNTs can be melted at temperatures ranging from 2000 to 3000 K, depending on their diameters. It is found that the melting temperature increases as the diameter decreases for both zigzag- and armchair-type tubes. In addition, it is shown that the melting process involves two stages in which the tube wall first becomes disordered followed by the formation of liquid-like structures inside the tube. Finally, we find that the melting point of SWCNTs depends strongly on the chirality index n-m. For example, the melting points of zigzag-type SWCNTs increase rapidly when n-m changes from 0 to 1 or -1.Keywords: Thermal stability, Melting behavior, Carbon nanotube",1,0

"We present the latest advances in optical frequency combs and their applications to precision metrology, including calibration techniques for high-resolution spectroscopy instruments such as Fourier transform spectrometers (FTS). We discuss how these techniques can be used to improve measurement accuracy by orders of magnitude over traditional methods.In particular we describe two novel approaches that are being developed at NIST:1) The use of an optical frequency comb locked to a high-accuracy atomic clock to calibrate FTS measurements with sub-Hz uncertainty. 2) A technique called 'self-calibration' which allows one to measure absolute frequencies without requiring any external reference standards or other auxiliary equipment. These techniques have been demonstrated using both laboratory experiments and field tests. They represent important steps towards realizing the vision of a future where all spectroscopic measurements will be traceable back to fundamental physical constants. This is especially relevant today given the growing interest in developing portable, low-cost devices capable of performing accurate chemical analysis anywhere around the world.",1,0
"We present new optical and ultraviolet (UV) spectra for the intrinsically X-ray weak quasar PHL 1811, obtained with the Keck Observatory's HIRES spectrograph in 1998-99. The data cover wavelengths between 3200 A and 10400Å at resolution R = λ/∆λ ≈ 45000. We find that the continuum emission is well described by an accretion disk model with parameters similar to those found previously for other quasars. However, we detect no broad absorption lines or narrow absorption features associated with outflows. In addition, there are several unusual properties of the line profiles which suggest that this object may be different than most quasars studied so far.Keywords: Quasars; Broad Absorption Lines; Accretion Disk Modeling. 1 IntroductionPHL 1811 was discovered as part of the Palomar-Green survey (SchmidtGreen 1983 ) and has been observed extensively since then. It is one of only two known examples of an X-ray weak quasar (Wilkes et al. 1994) , where the ratio of its soft X-ray flux density to its 2500 Å flux density is less than 0.1. Wilkes et al. (1994) suggested that it might have a high column density absorber along our line-of-sight, but subsequent observations failed to confirm this hypothesis (e.g., Mathur et al. 1995) . Instead, they concluded that the source must be intrinsically X-ray weak because of some unknown mechanism. Recent Chandra observations show that the spectrum below 2 keV can be fitted reasonably well using a power law plus Galactic absorption (Mathur et al. 2002 ) . This suggests that the intrinsic X-ray weakness could arise due to a steep spectral index rather than strong obscuration. Another possibility is that the X-rays are absorbed by ionized gas near the central black hole .PHL 1811 also shows interesting variability on time scales ranging from hours to years. For example, Wilkes et al. (1995) reported rapid changes in both the hardness ratios and luminosity during their ASCA observation. They interpreted these variations as being caused by partial",1,0

"The development of large space telescopes requires the use of lightweight materials to reduce launch costs and increase telescope performance in orbit. Silicon Carbide (SiC) is an excellent candidate material due to its high strength, low density, and radiation hardness at cryogenic temperatures. However, it has been shown that SiC exhibits significant changes in thermal expansion with temperature which can lead to dimensional instability during cool-downs or warm-ups. This work presents results on the measurement of the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of SiC-100 over a wide range of temperatures using a novel technique based on laser interferometry. The measured values are compared against literature data as well as theoretical predictions obtained by ab initio calculations.

"We report on our analysis of the outburst mechanism of SGR 1806-20, which is one of three known magnetars (neutron stars with superstrong magnetic fields).

The BAT light curve shows that there are two major flares lasting about 100 days each; these flares were also observed simultaneously at other wavelengths. In addition we find evidence for several smaller bursts occurring between the main flares. Using an improved version of the method developed by Israel et al. (2008) we searched for pulsations in the BAT data corresponding to the time intervals when the source was active.

"The development and application of superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) in magnetic resonance imaging has been reviewed, with emphasis on the recent advances made by our group at UCLA. The SQUID is an extremely sensitive magnetometer that can be used to detect very small changes in the local magnetic field produced by nuclear spins during NMR experiments. In this review we describe how these devices have been incorporated into several different types of low-field MRI systems including micro-SQUID arrays fabricated using standard semiconductor processing techniques as well as macroscopic SQUID gradiometers developed specifically for use in human brain studies. We also discuss some of the challenges associated with operating such instruments under conditions where the ambient magnetic fields are not completely shielded or controlled. Finally, we present results obtained recently using one of these new technologies to study the effects of anesthesia on functional connectivity within the human brain. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), which was first demonstrated more than 30 years ago, provides detailed information about the structure and function of living tissues through noninvasive measurements of their water content [1] . This technique relies upon the detection of tiny radio-frequency signals emitted by hydrogen nuclei when they precess around the main magnetic field B 0 , which is generated by a large electromagnet [2] . In conventional clinical scanners, the strength of B 0 ranges between 1 T and 3 T [3] . However, there are many applications where it would be desirable to perform MRI scans at much lower fields [4] . For example, the use of high-field magnets may cause significant heating problems due to dielectric losses in biological tissue [5] . Moreover, the cost of building and maintaining such large-scale facilities makes them inaccessible to most research laboratories [6] . Another disadvantage of working at higher fields is related to the fact that the relaxation times of protons become shorter [7, 8] . As a result, the signal-to-noise ratio decreases rapidly [9] making it difficult to obtain high-quality images [10] .",1,0

"We present the results for hadron production in semiinclusive DIS off nuclei at large Bjorken x and low Q^2, obtained with the HERMES experiment using data taken between 1997 and 2002. The analysis is performed within the framework of collinear factorisation and the modified perturbative approach to nuclear shadowing developed by Frankfurt et al.. We find that the observed suppression of leading neutron production relative to deuterium can be explained by nuclear effects alone without invoking any additional mechanism such as intrinsic charm or gluon saturation. In addition we observe an enhancement of strange particle production which cannot be described by conventional partonic models but may be attributed to the presence of intrinsic strangeness in the proton wave function.1 IntroductionSemi-inclusive deep-inelastic lepton-nucleus scattering (SIDIS) has been studied extensively over many years both experimentally [1]-[6] and theoretically [7][8][9] . This process provides information about the quark structure of the target nucleus through measurements of final state particles produced in association with the scattered lepton. At high values of Bjorken-x, where the struck quarks are highly virtual, SIDIS probes the transition region between the non-perturbative regime governed by confinement physics and the perturbative domain dominated by short-distance interactions [10] .In this kinematic range it becomes possible to study the properties of bound-state systems directly via their interaction with hard probe photons [11] , thereby providing insight into the dynamics underlying the formation of composite states [12] - [14] . Theoretical studies have shown that the cross section for SIDIS depends strongly on the transverse momentum k_T of the outgoing hadrons [15] - [17] . It was found that the dependence of the cross sections on k_T could be used to discriminate among different theoretical approaches [18] - [20] . For example, calculations based on the standard DGLAP formalism [21] predict a strong increase of the cross section with increasing k_T [22] while those employing the CCFM evolution equations [23] lead to much weaker dependences [24] .2 Experimentally measured quantities",1,0

"We report the discovery of an eclipsing binary system HS1857+5144, which is composed of two white dwarfs with masses 0.6 M⊙and 0.8M⊙respectively. The orbital period of this system is 1.5 hours. We find that the mass ratio q = M2/M1=0.84 ±0.04 for this system by using the method of spectral disentangling. This value indicates that it may be in the stage before the final merger into one single degenerate star. In addition to its short orbital period, we also found that the temperature difference between these two components is very large (∼10000K). These results suggest that this system has just evolved out of common envelope phase.Keywords: Hot subdwarf B stars; Eclipsing; Pre-Cataclysmic Variables; White Dwarfs; Spectral Disentangling",1,0
"We study the critical behaviour of irreversible reaction systems with mass-action kinetics in one dimension, using Monte Carlo simulations and mean-field theory. We find that for large system sizes there is no phase transition at all; instead we observe an abrupt change between two different dynamical regimes as a function of temperature T . For low temperatures (T < Tc) the dynamics are dominated by fluctuations which lead to slow relaxation times towards equilibrium. In contrast, for high temperatures (T > Tc), the dynamics become much faster since the system relaxes quickly into metastable states. The crossover temperature Tc depends on the number N of particles present in the system and increases logarithmically with N . The results presented here can be understood within the framework of the recently developed concept of 'active matter'. Active matter consists of self-propelled units such as living cells or artificial microswimmers. It has been shown that active matter exhibits similar properties as conventional condensed matter close to its critical point.",1,0
"The Neutrino Factory and Muon Collider Collaboration (NFMCC), in collaboration with other European laboratories is proposing an innovative concept for a large liquid argon imaging detector that will be used as part of the future Neutrino Factory or Muon Collider experiments at CERN. The proposed project aims to build a very massive modular LArTPC using state-of-the-art technology. This would allow us to exploit the unique features offered by this type of detectors such as: excellent particle identification capabilities; high spatial resolution; good time resolution; hermetic detection volume; possibility to operate under intense magnetic fields etc., which are essential requirements for precision measurements on neutrino oscillations parameters. In addition, it could also provide important information about CP violation effects in the leptonic sector.A detailed description of the physics case can be found here [1] .A technical proposal has been submitted [2] , including a preliminary design study [3] .In order to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach we have built a small prototype [4] consisting of: two TPCs filled with 1 tonne each of liquid argon; one central cathode made out of carbon fibre; four wire planes located above and below the cathode plane; three wire planes placed along the sides of the chamber; a set of scintillator paddles surrounding the active volume of the chambers.",1,0
"We study heavy quarkonium transitions to hybrid mesons by using the multipole expansion method within the framework of nonrelativistic potential models. We calculate decay widths for various types of transitions, including E1, M1, E2, M2, E3, M3, E4, M4, and S-wave pion emission processes. The results are compared with available experimental data as well as theoretical predictions based on other approaches such as lattice gauge theory.In addition we determine mass spectra of hybrids by solving Schrödinger equations numerically. It is found that our calculated masses agree reasonably well with those obtained recently by lattice gauge theories. Finally, we discuss possible production mechanisms of hybrid states at future experiments. This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 10675040.

"We present new observations with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Spitzer Space Telescope to study the galaxy population in the cluster Abell 2744 at z = 0.308. We find that most of the red sequence galaxies are located on the edges of the X-ray emission peaks, while blue cloud galaxies are found mostly inside these regions. The spatial distribution of star formation rate density is also consistent with this picture. These results suggest that ram pressure stripping may be responsible for quenching star formation activity in many central galaxies. In addition, we identify several flaring galaxies which show strong [O iii]λ5007 line emissions in their spectra taken by HST/ACS grism. They have high SFRs ranging between 100 - 400 M⊙ yr−1 , but they do not appear as AGNs based on their optical colors or mid-infrared properties. Their large velocity dispersions indicate that they might be undergoing mergers.",1,0
"We present the results of our numerical simulations of magnetized accretion disks in which we solve the mean-field magnetohydrodynamic equations for an axisymmetric disk with a prescribed radial distribution of angular momentum and mass fluxes, using the shearing-box approximation.We find that the magnetic field is amplified by differential rotation to produce large-scale poloidal fields whose strength increases outward as (r^-3/2) (where r is the radius). The toroidal component of the magnetic field also grows rapidly due to winding up of the poloidal field lines by shear flows. As a result, the plasma beta parameter decreases inwardly toward the central object. In addition, we find that the Maxwell stress associated with the magnetic field causes significant redistribution of angular momentum within the disk. This leads to enhanced transport of angular momentum outwards across the disk surface compared to viscous stresses alone.",1,0
"We present an analysis of anisotropies in the angular correlation function and its Fourier transform, the angular power spectrum, using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III Baryonic Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). We use this to constrain cosmological parameters including the equation-of-state parameter ww for dark energy as well as the matter density Ω_m and Hubble constant H_0. The results are consistent with previous measurements but have smaller statistical errors due to our larger sample size. In addition we find that the inclusion of redshift-space distortions improves constraints on all three parameters by about 10",1,0
"We present the results of an optical spectroscopic survey of radio galaxies in clusters at redshifts z=0.4-0.8, carried out with the William Herschel Telescope (WHT). We find that the fraction of AGN-powered radio galaxies decreases towards higher galaxy density environments within the clusters. This is consistent with previous studies which have found evidence for environmental quenching of star formation activity among massive galaxies. However we also find that there are many examples where powerful radio sources reside in dense regions without any obvious signs of being environmentally suppressed. These objects may be undergoing rapid evolution or they could represent a population of recently accreted field galaxies whose properties are still evolving to resemble those of their local counterparts. The sample consists of 20 radio galaxies selected from the VLA-COSMOS 3 GHz Large Project catalogue (Smolčić et al., 2009) using the following criteria: 1) They lie in one of four X-ray luminous clusters at 0.4 < z < 0.8; 2) Their radio luminosity lies above L(3GHz) = 10 25 W Hz-1; 3) They do not show strong emission lines indicative of ongoing nuclear activity; 4) They were observed during our WHT run on 2010 May 24-25.",1,0
"We present the results of our calculation for two-photon transition rates between excited states of atomic hydrogen, including all relevant bound-bound and bound-free processes. We use these results to calculate the evolution of the number density of neutral hydrogen atoms during cosmic reionization. The main goal is to study how this process depends on the properties of the first stars that ionize the universe.In particular we focus on the effect of different stellar initial mass functions (IMF) on the ionization history of the universe. For example, if massive stars are more numerous than low-mass ones then they will produce more photons per unit time which can lead to faster reionization. On the other hand, if most of the energy released by the first stars goes into winds or supernovae explosions rather than radiation then less UV photons would be produced leading to slower reionization. Our calculations show that the IMF has only minor effects on the overall duration of reionization but it does affect its detailed shape.",1,0
"The aim of this study was to evaluate whether virtual ultrasound (US) puncture tracts can improve percutaneous renal access in patients with complex anatomy and difficult-to-visualize calices on fluoroscopy.In total, 50 consecutive patients underwent US-guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy using an in-room C-arm system for real-time image guidance. The procedure was performed under general anesthesia or conscious sedation. A pre-procedural CT scan was obtained without intravenous contrast medium injection. Using OsiriX MD software, two urologists delineated the kidney contour and identified all visible calices. Subsequently, they projected their findings onto the live fluoroscopic images during the procedure. They were asked to perform punctures into each calyx that could be visualized on fluoroscopy. After successful puncture, stone removal was attempted through the sheath inserted via the needle. Successful puncture was defined as reaching at least one calix. Overall success rate was 88",1,0
"We study the connection between J-operators, which are defined as bounded linear operators on Banach spaces that satisfy the functional equation T_J(x+y) = T_J(x) + T_J(y) for all x, y ∈ X, and hypercyclic operators.The main result is that if X has an unconditional basis then every operator in the commutator ideal generated by any J-operator is hypercyclic (and even supercyclic). This generalizes earlier results due to Ansari, Bernal-González, Herrero-Burton, Johnson, Lancien, Salas, Shkarin, and Sourour.We also show how this theorem can be used to prove that certain classes of operators are not hypercyclic or have only trivial hypercyclic vectors. Finally we give some examples illustrating our results. The research leading to these results was supported by EPSRC grant EP/D076446/1",1,0
"We study the phase structure of a surface model defined by an energy functional that consists of two competing terms, one favoring smooth surfaces and another penalizing their curvature fluctuations. The latter is modeled as a harmonic term in the local mean curvature. We show that this model exhibits three phases depending on temperature T . At high temperatures (T > Tc), it behaves like a liquid; at low temperatures (T < Ts) it forms a solid-like state where all triangles are equilateral; for intermediate temperatures (Ts<T< Tc) we find a disordered glassy phase which can be characterized by its fractal dimension D = 2 − H ≈ 1.7 ± 0.1. This value agrees well with numerical simulations performed recently by other authors.In addition to these results, our analysis also provides evidence for a first-order transition between the ordered and disordered states. Finally, we discuss possible extensions of our approach towards more realistic models of biomembranes.",1,0
"We consider the problem of learning an unknown distribution over binary strings, where each string is generated by sampling independently at random with replacement according to some fixed probability vector . We show that if we are given samples drawn iid from , then it can be learned in polynomial time using standard statistical techniques (e.g., maximum likelihood). However, when the number of possible values for each bit grows large, this approach fails because there may not exist any sample which contains all possible values for every bit. In such cases, we propose a novel algorithm based on Gibbs sampling and prove its correctness under certain conditions. Finally, we present experimental results demonstrating our method's effectiveness. The main contribution of this work lies in showing how to learn distributions over combinatorial objects like graphs and trees. This is achieved by first reducing these problems into learning distributions over binary strings, and then applying our proposed algorithms. Learning distributions over combinatorial objects has many applications including data mining, computer vision, bioinformatics, etc. .",1,0
"We propose that the energy release process in coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is due to two different physical mechanisms, magnetic reconnection and catastrophic loss of equilibrium driven by ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities.The first mechanism releases free magnetic energy stored in the corona into kinetic energy of plasma flows during solar eruptive events such as flares or CMEs. This mechanism has been studied extensively using numerical simulations based on resistive MHD models with various levels of complexity ranging from simple two-dimensional configurations to more realistic three-dimensional ones. In this work we focus our attention on the second mechanism which involves rapid conversion of magnetic field energy into thermal energy through an explosive reconfiguration of the magnetic topology. We show how this mechanism can be modeled analytically within the framework of ideal MHD theory. Our results suggest that both processes are likely to operate simultaneously but at different stages of evolution of the erupting flux rope.",1,0
"We report the discovery of a new satellite galaxy, dubbed 'A pair of bootes' (ApoBootes), orbiting around our Galaxy at a distance of about 300 kpc in projection and with an estimated mass of 1.5 x 10^10 M_sun . ApoBootes is located on the opposite side of the Galactic center to the Magellanic Clouds and has a very low surface brightness. We have used deep near-infrared images taken by the VISTA telescope as part of the Vista Variables in the Via Lactea survey to identify this object. The photometric properties are consistent with those expected for a dwarf spheroidal galaxy. This work was supported by the Australian Research Council Discovery Project funding scheme under grant DP130104011. We present evidence that ApoBootes may be associated with a previously known overdensity of stars discovered by Belokurov et al. (2007) using SDSS data.",1,0
"We study the dynamics of an ensemble of elastically-coupled reed oscillators driven by a common acoustic field, and show that they can exhibit striking phenomena such as synchronized chaos or phase-locked states with multiple incommensurate frequencies. We also demonstrate how these effects are modified when the system is connected to a passive resonator. The results presented here may be relevant to understanding the behavior of biological systems such as colonies of fireflies or neurons.In recent years there has been growing interest in studying nonlinear dynamical systems composed of many interacting elements [1-3]. These studies have revealed new collective behaviors which cannot occur in single element systems [4] . Examples include synchronization [5-7] , clustering [8] , chimera states [9] , and spatiotemporal patterns [10-12] . In this work we consider a model consisting of N identical elastically-coupled reed-oscillators [13] driven by a common acoustic wavefield [14-16] (see Fig 1) . Each oscillator consists of two vibrating plates separated by a thin layer of air [17] . When the pressure difference across one plate exceeds its critical value, it begins to expand rapidly until the restoring force due to the other plate causes it to contract again. This process repeats periodically resulting in self-sustained oscillations at a frequency determined by the geometry of the device [18] .The coupling between neighboring oscillators arises because each oscillator acts like a small loudspeaker radiating sound into the surrounding medium [19-21] . As a result, nearby oscillators experience similar driving forces and their natural frequencies become locked [22] . If all oscillators lock onto the same frequency then the entire system behaves coherently; if different groups of oscillators lock on to different frequencies then the system exhibits spatially-extended multistability [23] .",1,0
"We present new results on interstellar absorption lines toward early type stars observed with UVES at VLT, as part of the ESO-POP project (ESO program 085.D-0571). We have searched for high-velocity clouds (HVCs) by looking for blueshifted components in the MgII doublet line profiles. The sample consists of 16 OB-stars located within 1 kpc distance from Earth. In addition to previously known HVCs we find several new ones. Some of these are associated with nearby galaxies while others may be related to Galactic halo gas. A comparison between our data set and previous surveys shows that there is no significant difference in the number density distribution of HVCs along different sightlines. This suggests that most of them are small structures which do not cover much solid angle around their host galaxy or star.Keywords: Interstellar medium",1,0
"We present an analytical model for calculating the aperture efficiency of a reflector antenna with circularly polarized feeds, based on ray tracing through the feed-horn optics and physical optics (PO) at the aperture plane. The PO method is used to calculate the electric field distribution over the aperture surface by solving Maxwell's equations using Green functions. We show that this approach can be applied to any type of feed horns, including corrugated conical horns or dual-polarized log-periodic dipole arrays. This work was motivated by our recent study of aperture efficiencies of two different types of antennas operating at 1.4 GHz: a single-dish radio telescope equipped with a corrugated conical feed horn and a multi-element interferometer consisting of eight log-periodic dipole array elements. In both cases we found good agreement between numerical results obtained with our new model and experimental data.Keywords: Antenna design",1,0
"We study the spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on the square lattice with nearest-neighbor (NN) exchange interactions J1, J2, and J3 along x-, y-, and z-directions respectively. We show that this system can be mapped onto an effective spin-1/2 XXZ chain by using the Holstein-Primakoff transformation for spins 1/2. The ground state phase diagram is obtained numerically by exact diagonalization method. In addition to the Néel ordered phase at small values of |J2/J1| < 0.5, we find two different types of quantum disordered phases depending upon the value of J3/J2. For large values of J3/J2 > 1.0, there exists a gapless singlet phase where all excitations are gapped out except one massless excitation corresponding to the Goldstone mode associated with the spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry. On the other hand, when J3/J2 < 0.5, there appears another type of disordered phase which has a finite energy gap between the ground state and first excited states. This phase corresponds to a valence bond solid phase where each site forms singlets with its NN sites only.Finally, we also discuss how these results may be relevant to understand the magnetic properties of some quasi-two-dimensional organic compounds such as EtMe3Sb[Pd(dmit)2]2 and κ-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu[N(CN)2]Cl.",1,0
"We present an overview of the theory and practice of nonparametric regression, with emphasis on its application in physics. We begin by introducing some basic concepts such as kernel density estimation (KDE) and spline smoothing. Then we discuss how these methods can be used for data analysis problems that arise frequently in physics experiments. Finally, we provide several examples illustrating our discussion. The goal is not only to introduce readers unfamiliar with this topic but also to give physicists who are familiar with it a new perspective on their work. This article serves as a companion piece to another one entitled 'Statistical Modeling of Physical Laws' which appeared earlier in ArXiv.org. In that article, we introduced the concept of parametric models and discussed how they can be applied to solve various types of data analysis problems encountered in physics experiments. Parametric models assume that all unknown parameters have been determined exactly beforehand; however, in many cases there may exist uncertainty about those values due to limited experimental precision or lack of knowledge. Nonparametric regression provides a way around this problem by allowing us to estimate the functional form of the underlying model without making any assumptions about the exact value of each parameter.",1,0
"We present new constraints on the merger rate density and mass ratio distribution for luminous red galaxies (LRGs) using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7). We use these results to place limits on the number of massive dark matter haloes that are not associated with LRG hosts in the local universe. The halo occupation model we employ is based upon an extension of the HOD formalism developed by Zheng et al. (2005) , which allows us to simultaneously constrain both the mean occupation function and its scatter at fixed luminosity as well as the fraction of satellite galaxies that have been recently accreted into their host haloes. Our analysis indicates that there exists a significant population of massive haloes that are not occupied by LRGs within our sample volume. This result suggests that either many of the most massive haloes were assembled very early during cosmic history and/or that they contain only low-mass galaxies.",1,0
"We study the dynamics of carrier-carrier interactions in semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) by solving numerically the time-dependent Schrödinger equation for two interacting electrons or holes confined to an anisotropic QD potential well. We find that, depending on the initial state, there are three different regimes of interaction between carriers which can be classified as weak coupling regime with no significant energy exchange; strong coupling regime where one electron is excited into higher states while another remains in its ground state; and finally, intermediate regime where both carriers undergo transitions simultaneously but at slightly different frequencies. In addition we show how these results depend on the dot shape and size parameters. Finally, we discuss possible applications of our findings such as generation of entangled photon pairs via biexciton decay. Quantum dots have been studied extensively over past decade due to their unique optical properties [1] . The most important feature of QDs is the possibility of controlling their emission wavelength through variation of their size [2] , allowing them to operate within a wide range of wavelengths [3] . In this work we focus on studying the effects of carrier-carrier interactions [4] in semiconductor QDs using numerical solution of timedependent Schrödinger equations [5] . Carriers interact strongly when they occupy neighboring single-particle levels [6] leading to formation of bound excitonic complexes [7, 8] . However, if carriers occupy distant single particle levels then their mutual Coulomb attraction leads to formation of virtual excitons [9] . These virtual excitons may either recombine radiatively [10] or non-radiatively [11] giving rise to Auger processes [12] . On the other hand, if carriers occupy adjacent single particle levels then their interaction becomes so strong that it cannot be treated perturbatively anymore [13] . This situation occurs e.g., during relaxation of photoexcited carriers [14] or in presence of external electric field [15] .",1,0
"We introduce the concept of separability functions, which are generalizations of Dyson indices to arbitrary finite groups. We show that these functions can be used as indicators for quantum entanglement in mixed states. In particular we prove that separability probabilities vanish if and only if all separable pure state decompositions have vanishing Schmidt coefficients. This is an extension of the result by Peres-Horodecki on positive partial transpose matrices. Finally we present some explicit examples illustrating our results. The concept of separability functions was introduced recently [1] . These functions provide a generalization of Dyson indices [2] , which were originally defined for Lie algebras, to arbitrary finite groups. They play an important role in physics since they appear naturally when studying the properties of many-body systems with short-range interactions [3] . In this work we study how separability functions behave under tensor products. It turns out that their behavior depends crucially on whether or not the group has Abelian subgroups. For example it follows directly from the definition that separability functions do not change at all under tensor product over Abelian groups. On the other hand there exist non-Abelian groups where separability functions increase exponentially under tensor product [4] . As another consequence of our analysis we obtain new bounds on the number of linearly independent separability functions [5] .",1,0
"The cosmological constant is one of the most important parameters in modern physics, and its value has been determined by observations to be extremely small but nonzero.In this article we will discuss how it can be explained as an effect of quantum gravity at very high energies. We will also show that if the universe underwent inflationary expansion after the Big Bang then there should exist primordial gravitational waves which could have observable effects on the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR). Finally, we will argue that these effects may provide us with new ways for testing the predictions of general relativity against those of alternative theories such as string theory or loop quantum gravity. The cosmological constant is oneof the most important parameters of modern physics. Its value was determined by observations to be incredibly small but non-zero. It plays a crucial role in our understanding of the evolution of the Universe since it determines whether the current accelerated expansion of space-time will continue forever or eventually slow down and stop. This question remains open despite many years of research into the nature of dark energy.",1,0
"We present low-temperature (LT) and high-temperature (HT) expansions for the excess internal energy, entropy, pressure, and chemical potential of hard-core penetrable-sphere (HCP-S) fluids in terms of the packing fraction η. The LT expansion is obtained by using an exact expression for the HCP-S pair correlation function at contact to calculate the virial coefficients up to order (η^10). We show that this approach yields results which are accurate over a wide range of temperatures and densities when compared against computer simulation data. In addition, we compare our results with those predicted by various integral equations including the Percus-Yevick approximation, the hypernetted chain closure, and the mean spherical approximation. Finally, we use the HT expansion to obtain analytical expressions for the thermodynamic properties of HCP-S fluids near their critical points.I. INTRODUCTORY REMARkS The study of simple model systems has played an important role in understanding many aspects of condensed matter physics [1] . One such system consists of particles interacting via repulsive potentials whose cores can be penetrated [2] , i.e., they do not have any finite minimum separation distance between them. This class of models includes both soft spheres [3] as well as hard-core penetrable-spheres [4] . In recent years there has been renewed interest in studying these types of interactions due to their relevance in describing colloidal suspensions [5] , granular materials [6] , and protein solutions [7, 8] . For example, it was shown recently [9] that the effective interaction between two proteins immersed in water can be accurately described by a hard-core repulsion plus a short-range attraction. It should also be noted that the concept of 'penetrability' may be used to describe other physical phenomena besides inter-particle interactions [10] .",1,0
"We study the energy dependence of jet transport coefficient κ and parton saturation scale Q_s in strongly coupled N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory (SYM) at finite temperature using AdS/CFT correspondence. We find that both quantities exhibit power law behavior with respect to the temperature, i.e., κ∼ T^-2/3 and Q_s∼ T^-1/2. The results are consistent with those obtained by lattice QCD simulations for hot nuclear matter produced in heavy ion collisions. In addition, we show that the ratio between these two scales is independent of temperature as expected from the dimensional analysis. Finally, we discuss possible implications on the phenomenology of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. PACS: 05.45.Mt, 11.10.Wx, 12.38.Gc, 14.20.Dh, 25 .75.-q",1,0
"We present results on J/psi production at midrapidity (y = 0) and forward rapidity (y = 3.2), using the PHENIX detector, for Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 130 GeV. The data are compared to theoretical calculations based on perturbative QCD with different sets of parton distribution functions. We find that none of these models can describe both datasets simultaneously.These results suggest that there is significant medium-induced gluon radiation which affects the fragmentation function of quarks into hadrons containing charm or bottom quarks. This effect may be related to the observed suppression of high-pT particles produced by heavy flavor quarks. PACS numbers: 25.75.-q, 11.10.Kk, 12.38.MhI . IntroductionHeavy quarkonia such as J/ psi , Ψ_c, andΨ_bhave been proposed as probes of the hot dense matter created in relativistic nuclear collisions [1] . In particular, it has been suggested that their yields could be suppressed due to color screening effects [2] and/or Debye mass effects [3] in this medium. However, recent measurements [4] show no evidence for such a suppression. Instead, they indicate that the yield increases slightly with centrality [5] . In order to understand how heavy quarks fragment in the presence of a thermalized medium [6] , we study J/psi production in Au+Au collisions at sNN= 130 GeV. Measurements were performed with the PHENIX experiment [7] at RHIC [8] .II. ExperimentA.

"We present new maps of the circumstellar SiO (v=1, v=2) masers around the Mira variable R Leo obtained with the Very Long Baseline Array at 22 GHz and 43 GHz. The observations were carried out on September 24th 2004 using all ten antennas available for VLBA operation during that time period. We detect two distinct groups of masers: one group is located near the star's position as determined by optical astrometry; another group lies about 0.5 arcsec to the south-west of this location. Both groups are associated with an extended bipolar structure seen in previous single-dish observations. This structure has been interpreted as a shell-like envelope surrounding the central star. Our results show that both groups of masers trace different parts of this shell-like structure. In addition we find evidence for a third component which may be related to the presence of a companion object.Keywords: Masers",1,0
"We study the competition between pseudogap formation, CDW ordering, and superconductivity within an extended Hubbard model on square lattice using DMFT+ED method. We find that at low temperatures there is no phase separation but instead a coexistence region where both phases are present with different weights depending on doping concentration. The results show that the pseudogap opens up around half-filling for all values of U studied here (U = 2 − 8t). At higher dopings we observe a dome-like structure which becomes more pronounced as U increases. In addition to this feature, we also see another peak in DOS near the Fermi level which corresponds to the onset of CDW order. This second peak disappears when temperature is increased or doping decreases. Finally, we have calculated the superfluid weight Δ_s^2 by solving linearized Eliashberg equations self-consistently. Our results indicate that the maximum value of Δ_s^2 occurs close to optimal doping.",1,0
"Transit timing is an important tool for detecting planets in multi-planet systems, as well as characterizing their orbits. In this work we present the first transit timing analysis of the Kepler data using the method developed by Agol et al. (2005) to detect additional bodies in planetary systems. We find that there are two new candidate planet pairs around KOI-284 (Kepler Object of Interest 284), which has been previously identified as having three transiting planets. The best-fitting model consists of four planets orbiting one star with periods ranging between 1.5 days and 12 years. This system shows strong evidence for orbital eccentricity among its planets. We also report on another system containing five planets, KOI-377, where our results show that it contains at least six planets. Finally, we discuss how these newly discovered systems can be used to test theories about formation and evolution of planetary systems. Transits provide information not only about the radius but also the mass of exoplanets. However, most known transiting planets have been found through photometric surveys such as Kepler or CoRoT, which do not allow precise measurements of the masses due to limited precision of the light curves. On the other hand, radial velocity surveys usually measure the mass more precisely than photometry does, but they cannot determine whether a given object transits because they lack phase coverage near inferior conjunction. Therefore, combining both techniques allows us to obtain accurate values of the radii and masses of transiting planets.Here we present the discovery of two new multi-planet systems based on combined photometric and spectroscopic observations made with the HARPS spectrograph attached to the 3.6 m telescope at La Silla Observatory. Both systems contain several super-Earths with short orbital periods. One of them, KOI-284, was already known to host three transiting planets; however, here we demonstrate that it actually harbors four planets. Our results suggest that all four planets have significant orbital eccentricities. Another system, KOI-377, hosts at least six planets.",1,0
"We present new near-infrared (NIR) observations and modeling results for the young stellar object, Barnard 68 (B68). The NIR data were obtained with the Gemini Near-Infrared Spectrograph on the 8-meter Gemini North telescope in Hawaii during two nights in December 2005. We used these data to construct an SED model that includes both photospheric emission and dust continuum emission. Our best-fit model suggests that B68 is surrounded by a dense core with a mass of 0.1 M_solar_(M_solar = 1.99 x 10^30 kg), which has been heated up to about 100 K due to the central star's radiation. This temperature corresponds to a luminosity of 3 L_sun_(L_sun = 3.84 x 10^26 W). In addition, we found that there are at least three other sources within the field-of-view of our observation whose fluxes contribute significantly to the total observed flux density.",1,0

We propose a novel method for ranking images based on their relevance with respect to users' interests as well as their popularity among other users. Our experiments show that our proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both quantitatively (in terms of precision) and qualitatively (by showing more relevant images). In addition, we demonstrate how this new ranking can be used to improve the performance of existing applications such as tag recommendation systems or photo sharing services. Social media has become one of the most popular ways people share information online. One of its main advantages is that it allows users to easily connect with each other through shared content. For example, Facebook currently hosts over 1 billion photos uploaded by its members [1] . Similarly, Flickr [2] , which was launched in 2002, now contains more than 100 million public photos [3] . In these platforms, users are able to upload pictures they have taken themselves or find interesting ones from others. They also provide mechanisms to annotate them using free-form text labels called 'tags' [4] . These tags allow users to describe what is depicted in the picture, but may not always accurately reflect the user's true interest [5] . As a result, when searching for specific topics, users often get irrelevant results [6] . To address this problem, researchers have recently started exploring techniques to rank images according to their relevance to users' interests [7, 8] . However, there still exists significant room for improvement [9] .",1,0
"The problem is to estimate the number of independent measurements in an experiment, given that some statistical properties are known for each measurement. The method proposed here uses only information about the mean value and variance of the distribution of results obtained by repeated measurements on one sample (or several samples). It can be used as a tool for planning experiments with minimal error or for estimating the accuracy of existing experimental data. This article presents a new approach to this problem based on the concept of entropy. In particular, it shows how to calculate the mutual information between two random variables using their probability density functions. A numerical example illustrates the application of these methods.Keywords: Redundancy estimation, Entropy, Mutual Information, Experiment Planning1 IntroductionWhen designing an experiment, we need to know what kind of precision our measuring instrument will give us. If we want to measure something precisely enough, then we should make sure that there is no correlation between successive measurements made on the same object [1] . For example, if we have a device which measures the temperature of water at room temperature T = 20 °C , then we would like to obtain values close to 20 ± 0.1°C when repeating the measurement many times [2] .In practice, however, such repeatability cannot always be achieved because of various factors affecting the measurement process [3] . Therefore, before starting any research work, you must determine whether your measuring equipment meets all requirements [4] .2 Problem statementLet X be a continuous random variable describing the result of a single measurement performed under certain conditions [5] . We assume that the distribution function F(x) of X has been determined experimentally [6] . Then the question arises - how many independent measurements do we need to perform so that the average deviation of the measured values does not exceed a specified threshold ?",1,0
"We present the results of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations made with the European VLBI Network (EVN) and the NRAO Very Large Array (VLA). The sample consists of 19 GPS radio sources selected on the basis that they have flat or inverted spectra between 5 and 8GHz, but steep spectra above 10GHz. We find that all these objects are compact in our EVN images; their sizes range from 0.1 to 2 mas. In addition we detect one source which is resolved into two components separated by about 3mas. This object has been previously detected as an extended source using VLA data alone. Our results show that most GPS sources appear unresolved even when observed with baselines up to 6000 km. However there appears to be some evidence for structural evolution within this class of objects. These results will help us understand how GPS sources evolve over time.Keywords: Radio astronomy",1,0
"We present new observations of intervening metal systems at z1.5-2.0 towards the gamma-ray burst (GRB) 050525A, which is one of only two GRBs with spectroscopic redshifts known to date.

This system has log NHI/cm−2 = 19.6 +0.2 −0.1 , corresponding to a total hydrogen column density of 5 × 1020 cm−2 . It also shows strong low-ionization transitions such as Al iii λ1854, 1854 + 1862, and S iv λ1063, 1073 that are not seen in typical high-redshift absorbers.

"We report on neutron scattering experiments performed to investigate magnetic excitations and their dispersion relations in the two-dimensional (2D) frustrated quantum magnets Zn0.8Cu3.2(OD)6Cl2 and Zn1.5Cu2.5(OD)6Cl2 with different Cu2+/Cu3+ ratio. The results show that both compounds are characterized by an energy gap at the zone center which is consistent with theoretical predictions for the 2D Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice. In addition we find evidence for a broad continuum of low-energy excitations extending up to about 5 meV. These findings suggest that these materials may be close to a quantum spin liquid state. We also present high-resolution powder x-ray diffraction data showing that the crystal structure remains unchanged upon deuteration.Quantum spin liquids are exotic phases of matter where spins remain disordered down to zero temperature due to strong quantum fluctuations. They have been predicted theoretically as ground states of many strongly correlated systems such as doped Mott insulators or geometrically frustrated magnets but so far only few experimental realizations exist. Here we report on neutron scattering investigations of two new candidate materials for this fascinating phase - the deuterated copper-oxalate based salts Zn0.8Cu2.9(OD)6Cl2 (Zn0.8Cu3O2Cl2·2H2O) and Zn1.5-Cu1.5(OD) 6Cl2 (Zn1.5Cu2O3Cl2·2H2O). Both compounds crystallize in the same monoclinic space group C2/c as previously reported for the non-deuterated parent compound ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2. However, they differ significantly in the amount of Cu2+ ions replaced by Cu3+ leading to changes in the local environment around each Cu ion. This has important consequences for the exchange interactions between neighboring spins resulting in significant differences in the observed magnetic properties.

"The extraction of fresh water and energy from the atmosphere is proposed as an alternative to conventional sources, which are limited in supply or environmentally damaging.The process involves condensing atmospheric moisture into liquid water using solar power and then collecting this water on a surface coated with hydrophobic materials that allow it to be easily transported by air currents.This technology could provide clean drinking water for remote communities without requiring large amounts of land area or infrastructure investment. It also has potential applications in agriculture where irrigation can be provided at low cost through the use of wind-driven sprayers. In addition, the collected water may be used directly as fuel if combined with electrolysis cells powered by renewable electricity. The process requires minimal maintenance once installed and would operate continuously over many years. A pilot-scale demonstration system was constructed near Tucson Arizona (USA) during 2011-2013. The results show that the system produces up to 1 gallon per day of potable water under favorable conditions.",1,0
"We present new observations at 1 mm and 3 mm wavelengths toward two Giant Molecular Clouds (GMC) in the Small Magellanic: Cloud, LMC N11B and 30 Doradus. We use these data to derive accurate masses for both GMCs by fitting their spectral energy distributions with modified blackbody functions. The derived masses are M(LMC N11B) = 2.1 x 10^6 M_sol and M(30 Doradus) = 5.2 x 10^7 M_sol . These values are significantly higher than those obtained using previous methods based on CO line measurements alone. This discrepancy is likely due to an underestimation of the gas temperature when only one or few lines are used as tracers. Our results show that the total cloud masses inferred from millimeter dust continuum emission can be up to three times larger than previously estimated. Millimeter dust continuum emission has been shown to provide more reliable estimates of the total cloud masses compared to other techniques such as single-dish radio observations of carbon monoxide (CO). However, most studies have focused on Galactic Giant Molecular Clouds (GMGs), while little work has been done towards extragalactic GMGs. In this study we present new observations at 1mm and 3mm wavelengths toward two Giant Molecular Clusters (GMCs) in the Small Magellan: Cloud, LMC N 11B and 30 Doradus; we also include archival data taken with the IRAM-30m telescope. Using these data sets we fit the observed SEDs with modified blackbody functions; our analysis shows that the derived masses are M(N11B)=2.1x10^6M_sol and M(Doradus)=5.2x10^7M_sol , which are significantly higher than those reported in previous works.",1,0
"We propose to use the open string field theory (OSFT) as a model for inflation in type IIB superstring theory, which is based on the tachyon condensation and its decay into closed strings. We show that this OSFT can be described by a noncommutative geometry with a fuzzy sphere background. The resulting effective action contains higher derivative terms such as R4 term, but it does not contain any ghosts or tachyons. This suggests that our proposal may provide a consistent description of inflationary universe within the framework of string theory. In addition we find that there are two possible ways to realize inflation depending on whether the inflaton is identified with the radius of the fuzzy sphere or the radial component of the gauge fields living on the branes. Finally we discuss some phenomenological consequences of these models. Introduction:-In recent years many attempts have been made towards understanding cosmology using string/M-theory [1] . One of the most interesting proposals has been the idea of D-brane inflation [2] , where one considers a stack of N coincident D3-branes moving slowly through the extra dimensions. It was shown that if the distance between the branes becomes small enough then they start to interact strongly via exchange of massless closed string modes [3] . As a result the potential energy density stored in the form of open strings stretched between them starts to decrease rapidly leading to spontaneous symmetry breaking [4] . The main problem associated with this scenario is how to stabilize the size of the extra dimensions so that the system remains at the minimum of the potential during inflation [5] ? A simple way out would be to consider compactification of the extra dimensions [6] . However, this leads to problems like moduli stabilization [7, 8] and also introduces unwanted degrees of freedom [9] . Another possibility is to introduce anti-D3-branes [10] which lead to additional contributions to the scalar potential [11] . But again this requires fine tuning [12] . Recently Sen [13] proposed another mechanism called 'tachyon condensation' [14] , where he showed that the unstable vacuum state corresponding to the maximum of the potential decays into stable states corresponding to minima",1,0
"We present the results of 3D radiation hydrodynamic simulations of accretion disks around black holes, performed with our new code RHD3DPHOTON. We show that this code is able to reproduce previous results obtained by other authors using different codes (e.g., JETSPEC), as well as some new results which have not been previously reported in the literature. In particular we find that:1) The disk becomes unstable when its luminosity exceeds a critical value Lcrit = 0.1LEdd.2) For super-Eddington luminosities there are two types of instability modes: one associated with thermal convection and another related to photon bubbles.3) There exists an upper limit on the mass flux through the disk, above which no steady state solution can be found. This result has important implications for models of AGN feedback. 4) When the luminosity approaches or exceeds LEdd, the disk develops strong outflows along the equatorial plane.",1,0
"We present an alternative approach to the dynamics of interacting Brownian particles, based on Feynman diagrams and path integrals in phase space. The method is illustrated by considering two examples: (i) the overdamped motion of N identical particles diffusing in one dimension under the influence of pairwise additive interactions; (ii) the diffusion of a single particle in three dimensions with arbitrary time-dependent external forces acting upon it. In both cases we obtain exact results for the mean-square displacement as well as higher-order correlation functions. We also discuss how our formalism can be used to study more complicated systems such as those involving hydrodynamic interactions between particles or active particles that perform directed motions. Interacting Brownian particles are ubiquitous in nature, ranging from colloidal suspensions [1] , granular matter [2] , and biological cells [3] to molecular motors [4] . Their collective behavior often exhibits non-trivial features which cannot be captured within standard statistical mechanics approaches [5] . In this work we develop a new theoretical framework to describe the stochastic dynamics of many-body systems composed of interacting Brownian particles. Our starting point is Feynman's path integral representation [6] of the probability distribution function P(rN;tN|r1t1;r2t2…rntn−1), where rN denotes the positions of all particles at times tN=t1,…,tn=NΔt, Δt being the discretization step size [7, 8] . This expression involves a sum over all possible trajectories connecting pairs of points r1,…,rn and t1,…,tn; each trajectory is weighted by its corresponding action S[rN;tN]=∫dtN[−kB TlnP(rN;tN=rNt;rN−1tN−1…)+Pext(rN;tN)], where kB is Boltzmann's constant and T is temperature [9] .",1,0
"We present the results of a numerical study on the relaxation dynamics of an initially straight contact line in a two-dimensional geometry, which is driven by surface tension and viscous dissipation at the moving interface between liquid and gas phases.We solve the Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible fluids with free-slip boundary conditions using a spectral element method to simulate the flow field around the evolving droplet shape. The initial condition consists of a circular droplet sitting on top of a flat substrate that has been perturbed slightly away from its equilibrium position. As time evolves, we observe the formation of capillary waves along the contact line as well as the development of small satellite drops near the main droplet due to pinching off events. In addition, we find that the contact angle decreases continuously during this process until it reaches zero degrees when the entire droplet detaches from the substrate. Finally, we compare our simulation results against experimental data obtained from high-speed video microscopy measurements performed by other researchers.",1,0
"We present new observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) that reveal an extended region of disturbed molecular gas surrounding the active galactic nucleus (AGN) of NGC 5194, also known as M51a or Whirlpool Galaxy. The AGN is located at the center of this interacting galaxy pair and has been classified as a Seyfert 2 based on optical spectroscopy. We detect two prominent dust lanes extending to the north-east and south-west of the AGN along its minor axis. These are likely caused by tidal forces between the galaxies during their interaction. In addition, we find evidence for a third dust lane oriented perpendicularly to these two features which may be associated with a nuclear bar. Our ALMA data show that the distribution of dense molecular gas traced by HCN(1-0), HCO+(1-0), and CS(2-1) emission lines exhibits a ring-like structure around the AGN. This feature appears to have been shaped by powerful outflows driven by the AGN.",1,0
"We present new results on the evolution of galaxy clustering in the range 0 < z < 5, based on an analysis of data obtained with the VIMOS spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). The sample consists of about 2000 galaxies selected by their Lyman-alpha emission line fluxes and covers a wide range of redshifts between 2<z<5. We measure the two-point correlation function for this sample using both direct counts-in-cells methods as well as Fourier space techniques. Our main result is that we find no evidence for any significant change in the amplitude or slope of the correlation function over this large redshift interval. This suggests that there has been little evolution in the typical mass scale of dark matter halos hosting these galaxies since z=5. In addition to measuring the overall shape of the correlation function, we also examine how it depends upon various physical properties such as luminosity, color, and spectral type.",1,0
"We study the profinite complex associated to a family of smooth projective curves over a field k with fixed genus g>0. We show that this is homotopy equivalent to the classifying space of the group Aut(C) of automorphisms of one curve C in the family (Theorem 1). This result generalizes previous results by Deligne on families of elliptic curves. In particular we obtain new information about the cohomology groups H^1(Aut(C),k*) for all such families (Corollary 2). In section 3 we use our results to prove some basic facts about the anabelian geometry of the moduli stack M_g of stable curves of genus g. For example we give a simple proof of the fact that the Picard scheme Pic0M_g has no torsion points if char(k)=0 or p>3g-2 (Proposition 4). The main tool used here are the results obtained in sections 1-2 combined with Grothendieck's comparison theorem between étale fundamental groups and Galois groups.",1,0
"We study the decay modes of neutrinos into unparticles, as well as their elastic scattering off electrons mediated by virtual unparticles. We find that these processes are strongly suppressed for small values of the coupling constant between ordinary particles and unparticles. For larger values of this coupling we obtain branching ratios which can be tested at future experiments such as T2K or NOVA. The results presented here may also have implications on other models with extra dimensions beyond those considered so far.IntroductionIn recent years there has been an increasing interest in theories where new physics is described by fields whose excitations do not carry standard model (SM) charges [1] . These so-called 'unparticles' [2] , if they exist, could manifest themselves through various experimental signatures [3] .In particular, it was shown [4] that decays of SM particles to pairs of unparticles would lead to deviations from the expected exponential behavior of the corresponding lifetimes. This effect should be observable experimentally [5] . Furthermore, it was suggested [6] that unparticles might play a role in explaining some puzzling features observed recently in cosmic ray data [7, 8] .Another interesting possibility is that unparticles couple directly to SM fermions [9] . If this were true then one would expect to see effects similar to those predicted in Ref. [10] for Kaluza-Klein gravitons coupled to leptons. Namely, the cross sections for certain processes involving SM fermions and unparticles would grow logarithmically with energy [11] . Such logarithmic growths have indeed been found [12] - [14] in several cases including e+e-→e+e-U, U→eν, and U→μτ. However, in all these studies only the case of scalar unparticles was considered. It turns out [15] that vector-like couplings give rise to additional contributions to the amplitudes which modify significantly the predictions obtained previously [16] .",1,0
"We study energy density-flux correlations for a free scalar field in 1+1 dimensions, both at finite temperature T and in vacuum (T=0). We show that these correlation functions are nontrivial even when evaluated on the light cone x+x=t+t0=2ct. In particular we find that they exhibit power law behavior with exponents which depend continuously on c. This is in contrast to what happens in ordinary quantum mechanics where such correlators vanish identically outside the light cone. The results presented here can be obtained by using standard techniques developed within the framework of thermofield dynamics. They provide further evidence that this formalism provides a useful description of thermal states also beyond equilibrium situations. Energy density-flux correlations play an important role in various physical phenomena ranging from hydrodynamics to particle production processes in heavy ion collisions. However their calculation has been hampered so far by the fact that it requires knowledge about off-diagonal elements of the two-point function of the corresponding operator. Here we present explicit expressions for these quantities for a free massless scalar field theory in one spatial dimension.",1,0
"We present new results on the nature of dust extinction in external galaxies, based on observations with HST/ACS of type Ia supernovae (SNe) at redshifts z=0.1-0.7. We find that SNe Ia are systematically bluer than expected if they were standard candles, but this effect is consistent with being due to dust extinction by interstellar material along their line-of-sight. In addition we find evidence for an additional component of dust extinction which increases rapidly towards higher redshift. This extra extinction may be associated with the intergalactic medium surrounding galaxy clusters, or it could arise within individual galaxies as a result of recent star formation activity. These findings have important implications for cosmological studies using distant SNe Ia as distance indicators.Keywords: Galaxy cluster, Interstellar matter, Intergalactic medium, Redshift evolution, Supernova, Supernova Ia",1,0
"We present the results of an investigation into the evolution of dark matter halos and their substructure, using high-resolution cosmological N-body simulations with different mass resolutions. We find that the number density profiles of subhalos are well described by a power law at all redshifts z < 5 for both low-mass (10^9 Msun/h) and high-mass (10^12 Msun/h) halos. The slope of this profile is independent of halo mass but depends on redshift; it steepens as time progresses. This behavior can be understood if we assume that the subhalo population consists of two components: one which follows the host's potential closely and another whose orbits have been significantly affected by dynamical friction. In addition, we show that the fraction of subhalos within r200c decreases rapidly towards higher masses. Finally, we demonstrate how our findings can be used to quantify the effect of numerical resolution on the abundance of subhalos.",1,0
"We give explicit formulae for the product of two Ozsvath-Szab o 4-dimensional manifold invariants in terms of their associated modular forms and theta functions.We also show that these products are not always positive, which is an obstruction to using them as intersection numbers on moduli spaces of curves.

These techniques involve studying certain periods of meromorphic differentials on hyperelliptic Riemann surfaces.

"We present mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopic observations of six active galactic nuclei (AGNs), obtained using the Infrared Spectrograph on board the Spitzer Space Telescope, and compare them to predictions based on radiative transfer models. We find that all objects show strong silicate absorption features at 9.7μm and 18.2μm, which are well reproduced by our models if we assume an optical depth of ∼10-20 along the line-of-sight through each torus component. The observed MIR fine structure lines can be explained by photoionization modeling only when taking into account extinction due to dust inside the torus. This is consistent with previous results showing that AGN tori have large covering factors. Our analysis shows that the obscuring material has a temperature distribution peaking around 300 000 K. Finally, we discuss how these findings may affect current ideas about the geometry of AGN tori.",1,0
"In this work, we consider a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system where each transmitter has limited feedback information about its channel state to the receiver. We assume that there is no cooperation between transmitters in terms of power allocation or transmission strategies. Each transmitter can only adjust its own transmit power level based on local CSI knowledge at the transmitter side. In addition, each transmitter may turn off its radio completely when it does not have any data to send. The objective is to maximize the sum rate by optimizing both the power control policy as well as the transmission strategy for all users simultaneously under these constraints.First, we derive an upper bound on the achievable sum-rate using finite-rate feedback assuming Gaussian codebooks. Then, we propose two algorithms to solve the optimization problem numerically. Finally, simulation results are presented to show the performance gain achieved by our proposed algorithm over existing schemes.",1,0

INTRODUCTORY REMARk The heavy fermion compound PrOs_4_2Sb_12 has been studied extensively since its discovery by de Haas-van Alphen effect [1] . It was found to have several interesting properties such as non-Fermi liquid behavior [2] , unconventional superconductivity [3] , and quantum criticality [4] . In particular, it shows two distinct superconducting transitions in both resistivity [5] and specific heat [6] experiments. However, these features were observed only after the sample had undergone severe mechanical stress during the measurement process [7, 8] . This suggests that the physical properties of PrOs_4_2 Sb_12 might depend strongly on the microscopic structure of the samples [9] .In fact, recent theoretical calculations suggest that the ground state of PrOs_4_2 Sb_12 should contain multiple competing orders [10] . Therefore, it would be very important to study the effects of external perturbations on the physical properties of this material [11] .",1,0
"We study the transport properties in a one-dimensional (1D) spin-orbit coupled system, where the electron-electron interactions are treated within the Hartree-Fock approximation. We find that for strong enough spin-orbit coupling and repulsive interactions there is an insulating phase at half-filling which can be understood as a Mott insulator due to the formation of bound states between electrons on neighboring sites. The transition into this state occurs when the Fermi energy crosses the lowest bound state. In addition we show how the presence of disorder changes these results. Finally, we discuss possible experimental realizations of our model using semiconductor nanowires or carbon nanotubes. Introduction:-In recent years it has been realized that many interesting phenomena observed in condensed matter physics such as high-Tc superconductivity [1] , fractional quantum Hall effect [2] etc., have their origin in strongly correlated electronic systems. One of the simplest models describing interacting fermions is the Hubbard model [3] . However, even though much progress has been made over the past few decades [4] , exact solutions of the Hubbard model are still lacking [5] . Recently, several authors [6] - [8] studied the effects of spin-orbit coupling on the ground-state properties of 1D Hubbard chains by employing various numerical techniques like density matrix renormalization group [9] , exact diagonalization [10] , DMRG [11] , Bethe ansatz [12] , variational Monte Carlo [13] , Quantum Monte Carlo [14] etc.. It was found that depending upon the strength of spin-orbit coupling and the value of Coulomb repulsion U , different phases appear in the ground state. For example, if the spin-orbit coupling is weak compared to the hopping amplitude t then the ground state is either metallic or insulating depending on whether U/t < 2 or U/t > 2 respectively [15] . On the other hand, if the spin-orbit",1,0
"We report on the search for a K-nuclear bound state in 4 He using the reaction ^4He (K - , n). The experiment was performed at TRIUMF with an incident beam energy of 1 GeV and a target thickness of 0.5 cm. A total number of 2.1 x 10 9 events were recorded by two large area silicon strip detectors placed downstream of the target. No evidence is found for such a state within the kinematic limits set by the experimental resolution. Upper limits are determined as a function of the binding energy B and the width Γ of the hypothetical state. For a narrow resonance with B = 50 MeV/c2 we find that the upper limit to its production cross section is 3 nb/sr at 90",1,0
"The formation and characterization of bovine serum albumin (BSA) nanoparticles formed by electrostatic interaction between anionic graft copolymer poly(acrylic acid-co-methacrylamide) (PAM-g-PAA) and protein in aqueous solution are reported here. The size, shape, surface charge density distribution, zeta potential, and stability of these particles were investigated as functions of polymer concentration, ionic strength, temperature, and pH value. It was found that PAM-g-PAA/BSA nanoparticles could be prepared over wide ranges of conditions. At low pH values, the particle sizes increased slightly with increasing polymer concentrations due to the increase in intermolecular interactions among proteins. However, when the pH value reached 7.0, the particle sizes decreased significantly because of the decrease in net charges on both polymers and proteins. In addition, it is shown that the shapes of PAM-g-PAA/protein nanoparticles changed from spherical to ellipsoidal or rod-like structures depending upon the pH values.",1,0
"We present new results on the morphological properties, gas content, and star-formation activity in a sample of low-mass (M* < 1010 M⊙) galaxies at z = 0.5 − 1.0 drawn from the GOODS-North field. We use deep HST/ACS imaging to measure galaxy sizes, Sérsic indices, and bulge-to-disk ratios for these objects. In addition we obtain Spitzer/MIPS 24µm photometry which allows us to estimate their total infrared luminosities as well as dust-corrected SFRs using the prescription of Kennicutt et al. (2009) . Our main findings are summarized below:-The majority of our sample is composed by disk-dominated systems with n < 2. The median value of B/T is 0.3 ± 0.1.-There exists an anti-correlation between stellar mass and size that can be explained if most of this population has experienced recent episodes of intense star formation. This would have caused them to expand significantly while still being dominated by young stars.-Most of the galaxies in our sample show high specific star-formation rates (SSFR > 10^-10 yr-1). These values are comparable or even higher than those found among local dwarf irregular galaxies. -Our data suggest that there may exist two different populations within our sample. One group shows relatively large sizes and low SSFRs indicative of quiescent disks. A second class displays smaller sizes but much higher SSFRs suggesting they could be undergoing rapid growth through mergers and/or accretion events.",1,0

"We present an efficient data redistribution scheme that allows the parallel execution of computations on dynamically resized computational domains in distributed memory environments. The proposed approach is based on multidimensional block-cyclic distributions and exploits locality by using space-filling curves to map blocks onto processors. We show how this technique can be used to efficiently redistribute data between different processor configurations, while minimizing communication overheads. Our experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing approaches when executing applications with dynamic load balancing requirements. In particular, we achieve speedups up to 3Â compared to state-of-the-art techniques such as the one presented in [1] .IntroductionParallel computing has become increasingly important due to its ability to solve large problems faster than serial computers [2] , but it also presents new challenges related to the distribution of work among multiple processing units [3] . In order to take advantage of parallelism, many algorithms are designed so that they can run simultaneously on several processors [4] . However, these algorithms often require some form of data redistribution during their execution [5] . For example, consider a computation where each process stores part of a dataset (e.g., matrix) [6] . If the number of processes changes at runtime, then all processes need to exchange information about which parts of the dataset they store before continuing [7] . This problem becomes even more challenging if the size of the datasets stored by individual processes varies [8] or if there are dependencies between them [9] .",1,0
"The deformation principle is the main tool in this article for constructing new geometric structures on physical spaces, which are not necessarily Riemannian manifolds but can be more general objects such as Finsler or pseudo-Finsler ones.The basic idea behind it consists in deforming an initial space into another one by means of some suitable transformation group acting transitively on both spaces. This method allows to obtain many interesting results concerning various aspects of geometry and physics (e.g., geodesic flows,...). In particular, we show that any homogeneous Finsler manifold admits a canonical connection with totally skew-symmetric torsion whose curvature tensor satisfies certain properties similar to those satisfied by the Weyl conformal curvature tensor. We also prove that every locally Minkowski spacetime has a natural generalization of the Poincaré metric, called the generalized Poincaré metric, which turns out to be invariant under all local Lorentz transformations. Finally, we present several examples illustrating our approach.",1,0
"Cirrus clouds are an important component in Earth's radiation budget, but their radiative properties remain poorly understood because they occur at high altitude where direct measurements are difficult to make. In this study we use data collected by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) lidar system located on the SIRTA observatory near Paris during [2002] [2003] [2004] [2005] [2006] . The observations show that cirrus clouds can be found between 5 km and 12 km above sea level with a mean optical depth of 0.2 ± 0.1. We find that mid-latitude cirrus clouds have multiple tropopause features such as double or triple tropopauses which may affect their microphysical structure. These results suggest that cirrus clouds play an important role in determining the vertical distribution of water vapor in the atmosphere. Citation:IntroductionCirrus clouds cover about 10",1,0
"We report on spectropolarimetric observations of the M8+M9 binary star LHS 1070A,B (GJ 436) with ESPaDOnS at CFHT. The two stars are separated by only 0. ′′ 1 and have been known to be magnetically active for many years. We find that both stars show significant circularly polarized emission lines indicative of Zeeman splitting due to their magnetic fields. In addition we detect Stokes V signatures indicating net linear polarization across all observed spectral lines. This is likely caused by scattering processes within the stellar atmosphere. Using our new data set together with previously published photometric measurements we derive rotation periods of P A = 3.6 ± 0.1 days and P B = 4.2 ± 0.3 days for the primary and secondary component respectively. These values are significantly longer than those derived from previous studies which were based solely on photometry. Our results suggest that the rotation period of each individual component depends strongly on its effective temperature as well as its surface gravity.",1,0
"We give an explicit formula for the star product on the cotangent bundle T^*M over a Poisson manifold (M,π) with symplectic leaves L_i and corresponding moment maps μ_i : T^*M → L_i.We show that this star product is given by the formula(f ⋆ g)(x) = ∑_i=0^n f(x)g(μ_i^-1(x)) π^ij(x) where π^ij are the components of the inverse matrix to the Poisson tensor π_ij.This result generalizes earlier results obtained by Kontsevich [K] , Fedosov [F]and others.It also gives a new proof of the fact that the star product is uniquely determined up to isomorphism by its properties of associativity and commutativity.The main idea behind our approach is to use the formalism of Koszul complexes developed by Getzler [G1] .",1,0
"We present here an application of the Scenario Machine (SM) to calculate the luminosity functions for different types of binaries in our Galaxy, including black hole and neutron star systems as well as white dwarf - main sequence stars. The SM is used to generate synthetic populations of these objects by assuming that they are formed according to some initial mass distribution and evolve through various stages following evolutionary tracks obtained from stellar evolution calculations. We find good agreement between the results of this method with those derived from observations. This work was supported by NASA grant NAG5-10842. Keywords: Binary X-rays Sources; Luminosity Function; Stellar Evolutionary Tracks. 1 Introduction X-ray binaries are composed of either two neutron stars or one neutron star plus another object such as a black hole or a white dwarf. They can be divided into three categories based on their orbital periods; short-period (P orb < 3 hrs), intermediate-period (3 hrs < P orb < 100 days), and long-period (P orb > 100 days). In addition there exist several classes of X-ray transients which have been observed at all periods but whose nature has not yet been determined conclusively [1] . These include soft X-ray transients, supersoft X-ray transients, classical novae, symbiotic stars, recurrent Novae, and microquasars [2] . The number density of X-ray binaries per unit volume depends upon both the formation rate of binaries and how many survive until they become detectable [3] . Since most of them are located within 10 kpc of Earth [4] , it is possible to estimate the total number of X-ray binaries in our galaxy if we know the space density of each type of system [5] . However, since only about 10",1,0
"We have studied the variation of the Amati relation (Amati et al., 2002) in a sample of about 100 GRBs detected by Swift satellite and we found that it is not constant, but varies as a function of redshift z. We also find that this effect cannot be explained only by selection effects due to detector thresholds.The observed evolution can be described by a power law dependence on cosmological time t (1+z)3.5. This result suggests that there may exist some physical mechanism responsible for such behaviour. In particular, we suggest that the luminosity distance dL could play a role in determining the shape of the spectrum at high energies. If so, then the spectral properties of GRB prompt emission are related to its intrinsic luminosity rather than being determined solely by the geometry of the emitting region.The results presented here support previous claims that the Amati relation should be used cautiously when applied to distant bursts.",1,0
"We present an analysis of the properties of giant planet candidates detected by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) survey, which has been monitoring stars towards the Galactic bulge for more than ten years. We find that most of these systems are likely to be composed of two low-mass objects with masses below 0.5 MJup orbiting each other on periods longer than 100 days. The majority of them have orbital inclinations close to 90 degrees. These results suggest that many of the planetary mass companions found around nearby solar-type stars may also exist around distant red giants. This is important because it allows us to study their atmospheric composition using high-resolution spectroscopy.Keywords: Planetary systems; Planets; Transiting exoplanet searches; Red-giant stars; Bulge; Massive star formation; Stellar evolution; Extrasolar planets; Astrophysics",1,0
"We consider the problem of local purification in quantum networks, where each node is allowed to perform only local operations and communicate classically with its neighbors. We show that for any graph G = (V, E) there exists an algorithm which transforms any pure state on V into another pure state such that:1. The number of qubits communicated between neighboring nodes does not exceed O(log n), where n is the size of the network.2. Each node performs at most polylogarithmic many local operations. Our result implies that if we allow unlimited amount of entanglement then it suffices to use only logarithmic amount of classical communication per edge. This improves upon previous results by Aaronson et al., who showed that Ω(n log n) bits are necessary even when all states are restricted to be product states. In addition our result shows how to constructively convert this bound into an efficient protocol.",1,0
"We propose an optical scheme for implementing the Gaussian valence bond (GVB) state, which is one of the most important classes of quantum states in condensed matter physics. The GVB state can be used to describe many-body systems with strong correlations such as spin liquids or Mott insulators. We show that our proposed scheme allows us to distribute entanglement between two distant parties by using only linear optics elements and single-photon sources. Our results may have potential applications in quantum information processing.IntroductionQuantum entanglement plays a crucial role in various fields ranging from quantum communication [1] , quantum metrology [2] , quantum sensing [3] , and quantum computing [4] . In particular, it has been shown that quantum entangled states are useful resources for quantum teleportation [5] , superdense coding [6] , remote state preparation [7] , and quantum key distribution [8] .In recent years, there has been growing interest in studying quantum entanglement in many-body systems [9] - [11] . For example, the ground-state wavefunction of strongly correlated fermions on lattices can be written as a product of local singlet pairs known as valence bonds [12] . This class of states is called valence-bond solid (VBS) states [13] . It was later found that VBS states can also be represented by so-called valence bond basis [14] . These states include the famous Néel state [15] describing antiferromagnetic order [16] , the Haldane phase [17] corresponding to integer-spin chains [18] , and the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) model [19] representing gapped spin-1/2 chain [20] .Recently, several schemes [21]- [23] were proposed to generate these types of quantum states experimentally. However, all existing proposals require nonlinear interactions among photons [24] and/or complicated setups [25] . Therefore, they cannot be implemented easily in practice. On the other hand, some experimental demonstrations [26] - [28] have been performed recently to produce photonic qubits [29] . Thus, it would be interesting if we could find ways to implement these quantum states without requiring any nonlinear interaction [30] .",1,0
"We present the results of numerical simulations of two-dimensional N = (2, 2) super-Yang-Mills theory with gauge group SU(N). We use an improved action and perform calculations at several values of the coupling constant g in the range 0.1 < g < 1.0. The lattice size is 16 x 32 for all our runs except one where we used 24 x 48 sites. In order to study finite-size effects we have also performed some runs using 12 x 24 and 20 x 40 lattices.The main goal of this work was to check whether the phase transition between confinement and deconfinement phases observed previously by other authors persists when the continuum limit is approached.Our data show that there are no significant differences between the results obtained on different sizes of lattices within statistical errors. This indicates that the system does not undergo any phase transitions as it approaches the continuum limit.",1,0
"We report on the measurement and analysis of phase-resolved spontaneous emission in an optically pumped semiconductor laser with external cavity feedback (ECF). The ECF is formed by two mirrors, one of which has a variable distance to the active region of the laser diode. We show that this allows for tuning the delay between the optical pulses emitted at each round trip through the external cavity. By measuring the time dependent intensity autocorrelation function we are able to determine the pulse duration as well as the repetition rate of the pulsed output. In addition, we demonstrate how these parameters can be used to extract information about the carrier dynamics inside the gain medium.A detailed description of the experimental setup together with results obtained under different operating conditions will be presented. Finally, we discuss possible applications of our method including its use for studying relaxation oscillations or mode locking phenomena in lasers. Stimulated emission occurs when electrons in a material absorb energy from photons and then re-emit them into free space. This process is responsible for generating light in many common devices such as LEDs and lasers. However, it remains challenging to directly measure the properties of stimulated emission because the signal-to-noise ratio is often very low due to the small number of spontaneously emitted photons compared to those generated via stimulated emission. Herein, we present a new approach based on using a tunable external cavity to enhance the signal strength while simultaneously allowing us to control the timing of the emitted photons. Using this technique, we have been able to perform high-resolution measurements of the temporal characteristics of stimulated emission in a semiconductor laser.",1,0
"We present an overview of our recent work on vector meson production in heavy ion collisions at RHIC and LHC energies, based on holographic QCD models with chiral symmetry breaking (AdS/QCD). We discuss how these models can be used to calculate hadronic observables such as transverse momentum spectra and elliptic flow coefficients for light quarks and gluons produced in nuclear reactions. In particular we focus on the role played by the coupling between the bulk fields and the gauge field fluctuations dual to vector mesons. The results are compared with experimental data obtained at RHIC and LHC: they show good agreement both qualitatively and quantitatively.Keywords: Vector Mesons, Heavy Ion Collisions, Holography, Chiral Symmetry Breaking, Gauge/Gravity Duality1 IntroductionOne of the most exciting discoveries made recently at RHIC is that strongly interacting matter behaves like a nearly perfect fluid [1] . This observation has led many theorists to propose new ways of describing this state of matter using effective theories which incorporate hydrodynamics [2] , or even more exotic descriptions involving quark-gluon plasma droplets [3] .In order to understand better what happens during the early stages of heavy-ion collisions it would be very useful if one could study experimentally the properties of the hot dense medium created in those collisions. However, due to its extremely short lifetime, this medium cannot be directly probed through standard scattering experiments. Instead, information about the initial conditions of the collision process must be inferred indirectly from final-state measurements [4] . For example, the collective expansion of the system leads to anisotropic particle emission patterns known as azimuthal asymmetries [5] . These anisotropies have been measured [6] and found to agree well with theoretical predictions [7, 8] .Another important observable characterizing the dynamics of the expanding fireball is the spectrum of emitted particles [9] . It was shown [10] that the shape of this spectrum depends sensitively on the equation-of-state of the medium [11] . Moreover, the observed suppression [12] of high-pT hadrons",1,0
"In this work, we investigate the trade-offs among processing gains and timing jitters for impulse radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) systems with different pulse shapes. We first derive closed-form expressions to calculate the bit error rate (BER), which is used as performance measure. Then, by using these results, we analyze how the BER changes according to various system parameters such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), number of pulses per symbol, and timing jitter variance. Finally, numerical examples are provided to verify our analysis. The main contributions of this study can be summarized as:1 . Derivation of closed-form expression for calculating the BER.2 . Analysis on the effect of timing jitter on IR-UWB systems.3 . Numerical verification of analytical results. In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing high data-rate wireless communication systems that operate over unlicensed bands [1] , especially those based on impulse radio ultrawideband (IR-UWB: [2] ). Compared to conventional narrowband systems, IR-UWB systems have several advantages including low power consumption [3] , immunity against multipath fading [4] , and high security [5] . However, one major drawback of IR-UWB systems is their vulnerability to timing jitter [6] - [8] . This problem arises because the received signals may experience time delays due to channel dispersion or clock imperfections at both transmitter and receiver sides [9] . As a result, the transmitted symbols cannot be recovered correctly if they arrive out of phase [10] . Therefore, it is important to understand the effects of timing jitter on the performance of IR-UWB systems [11] . To address this issue, many studies have investigated the impact of timing jitter on various aspects of IR-UWB systems [12]- [16] . For example, in [13] , the authors analyzed the effect of timing jitters on the energy efficiency of IR-UWB systems. They showed that the energy efficiency decreases when the timing jitter increases. Also, in [14] , the authors studied the relationship between timing jitter and bit error probability (BEP). However, most existing works only",1,0
"We present deep imaging data for the nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxy, Hercules (dSph), obtained with the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). The new observations are used to study the structure and stellar populations in this system. We find that the surface brightness profile is well described by an exponential function over most of its extent but shows evidence for a break at about 30 arcsec radius. This feature may be associated with tidal disruption or stripping due to interactions between Hercules and other galaxies. Using colour-magnitude diagrams we show that there exists two distinct components within Hercules; one which has been stripped off and another which appears to have remained intact. These results suggest that Hercules was once more extended than it currently is today. Finally, using our photometric catalogue we measure the line-of-sight velocity dispersion as a function of projected distance from the centre of Hercules. Our measurements indicate that the central region of Hercules exhibits higher values compared to those measured further out.",1,0
"We present position-velocity diagrams (PVD) of masers in an accretion disk around a young stellar object, obtained with VLBI observations at 22 GHz and 43 GHz. The PVD are compared to those expected by models that include both rotation and radial motions. We find that our data can be explained if we assume that the emission comes from a ring-like structure located between 0.1 AU and 1 AU from the central star. This is consistent with previous results based on single-dish observations. Our analysis also shows that there must exist some kind of mechanism able to produce inward motions within this region. These could be due either to infalling material or to outflows produced by the protostar itself. Finally, we show how these results can be used as diagnostics tools to study the physical conditions inside circumstellar disks. Keywords: Accretion Disk, Circumstellar Disks, Infrared",1,0
"We present Herschel Space Observatory observations at 70, 160, 250, 350, and 500 microns toward two fields centered on the densest parts of the Rho Ophiuchi (RO) molecular cloud complex. The data are used to derive the temperature distribution within dense cores identified by their infrared emission using the method developed by John MyersSean Carey. We find that most of these cores have temperatures between 10 K and 20 K with only one colder than 8 K. This is consistent with previous studies showing that cold cores are rare in star-forming clouds. Using our derived temperatures we calculate masses assuming optically thin greybody emission. These masses range from 0.1 Msun to more than 100 Msun. In addition, we use the same dataset to study the properties of protostars embedded in the RO region. We identify 16 Class I sources based on their spectral energy distributions and compare them to those found in other nearby star-forming regions such as Serpens South or Orion B North.",1,0
"We present an analysis of the relationship between excluded volume and cooperative effects in proteins with respect to their folding rates. We show that these two factors are not independent but rather have opposite relationships with rate constants for different classes of proteins. The results suggest that both excluded volume and cooperativity play important roles in determining the folding rates of globular proteins. In particular, we find that the effect of excluded volume on folding rates is strongly dependent upon the degree of cooperativity exhibited by each protein class. This dependence arises because the presence of large amounts of nonlocal structure can compensate for the loss of local interactions due to excluded volume. Our results also indicate that there may be a fundamental difference between how fast-folding and slow-folding proteins fold. Finally, our findings provide insight into why some proteins fold faster than others despite having similar structures. Proteins fold through a series of conformational changes driven by thermal fluctuations or other external forces such as ligand binding. These processes occur over time scales ranging from microseconds to seconds depending on the size and complexity of the folded state1 . Despite this wide range of timescales, all known proteins share common features including compact tertiary folds2 , hydrophobic cores3 , and secondary structure elements4 . Theoretical studies5-7 have shown that the free energy landscape governing protein folding contains many metastable states separated by barriers whose heights depend on the strength of native contacts8-10 . Because the height of these barriers determines the overall folding rate11-13 , it has been suggested14-16 that the folding process occurs via a rugged funnel-like free energy surface17-20 . However, recent experiments21-24 have challenged this viewpoint25-27 by showing that the folding mechanism of several small single-domain proteins does not involve significant kinetic intermediates28-30 . Instead, these proteins appear to fold directly from unfolded states to folded ones without passing through any partially folded states31-33 .",1,0
"We report on the first detection of proper motion in two thin dust filaments located near Sgr A*, the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center of our Galaxy. The filaments are detected as dark features against bright infrared background emission and have been observed with the Submillimeter Array for more than four years. We find that both filaments show significant proper motions toward us, which we interpret to be due to their orbital motion around Sgr A*. Using simple models, we estimate the masses of these filaments to be between 10^6 M_sol and 10^7 M_sol . These results provide new insights into the formation process of such structures close to galactic nuclei. Dust filaments are ubiquitous in galaxies across cosmic time. They can form by gravitational instabilities or through outflows driven by active galactic nuclei (AGN). However, it is still unclear how they evolve over time and what physical processes drive them. In this Letter, we present the first measurement of proper motions of two thin dust filaments at projected distances of less than 100 pc from Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the central supermassive black hole of the Milky Way. Our observations were carried out using the Submillimeter Array (SMA; Ho et al., 2004) , an interferometer operating at wavelengths ranging from 0.8 mm to 3.5 mm. Both filaments appear as dark features against the bright infrared background emission produced by warm dust surrounding Sgr A*. Their apparent velocities range from 50 km/s to 150 km/s , consistent with previous measurements based on single-dish data (Molinari et al., 2011) . By modeling the orbits of the filaments under Newtonian gravity, we derive mass estimates of about 106-107 solar masses (Msolar) for each filament. This result suggests that the filaments may represent gravitationally bound objects orbiting Sgr A*.",1,0

This object was discovered by the Einstein Observatory as part of the first systematic survey of the Galactic plane (HertzGrindlay 1984) . It has been observed several times since then using different instruments including ASCA (Sugizaki et al. , 1997) , BeppoSAX (Giacani et al. , 2001 ) , RXTE (Israel et al. , 2002 ) and Chandra (Pavlov et al. , 2004 ) . Its position coincides within errors with the brightest peak of the radio shell detected by the VLA (Kothes et al. , 2006 ; Gaensler et al. , 2008 ) .

"We present new photometry for the open cluster NGC 1846, located at the edge of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). The data were obtained with the Wide Field Imager on the MPG/ESO 2.2 m telescope and cover an area of about 1 square degree around the cluster center. We find that there is no evidence for any significant differential reddening across this field. Using these observations we derive a distance modulus to the SMC of 18.9 mag, which agrees well with previous determinations based on other methods.In addition, we identify two distinct sequences in our color-magnitude diagram (CMD) along the lines expected if the cluster contains both old and intermediate-age populations. This finding supports earlier suggestions by several authors who found similar features in CMDs of other clusters in the SMC. However, while most of those studies suggested ages between 10 and 100 Myr for their second population, we find here that it must be significantly older than 300 Myr.",1,0
"We present the discovery and characterization of two 'hot Jupiter' planets orbiting stars that are members of wide binaries, HD 196885AB (a = 1.8 AU) and HD 208598AB (a = 3.6 AU).

"We study the Penrose limit of certain complex marginal deformations of AdS5×S 5 . We show that these are dual to supergravity solutions describing wrapped M2-and M5-branes on S 3 × R 4 , which can be interpreted as giant gravitons in AdS5×S5 . The corresponding string theory backgrounds have been constructed by Lunin and Maldacena using T-duality transformations along Hopf fibers of Sasaki-Einstein spaces . The Penrose limit is taken with respect to an appropriate null geodesic lying inside the horizon of the black hole solution . In this way we obtain new supersymmetric pp-wave solutions of type IIB supergravity whose near-horizon geometry is given by AdS3×S 3 ×R 2 or AdS2×S 2 ×R 2 depending on whether one takes the Penrose limit for the deformation parameter equal to zero or not respectively .",1,0

"We present the first measurement of single-transverse-spin asymmetries (SSA) for hadronic dijets produced at midrapidity in p+p collisions at sqrt(sNN) = 5.02 TeV using data collected by the CMS experiment during 2012 corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 fb-1 . The SSAs are extracted as functions of jet transverse momentum and rapidity, azimuthal angle between jets, and event centrality. We observe no significant dependence on any kinematic variable except that the magnitude of the asymmetry decreases with increasing jet rapidity. Our results are compared to theoretical predictions based on perturbative QCD calculations including higher-order corrections and parton distribution function uncertainties.The measured values agree well within experimental and theoretical uncertainties. This is the most precise measurement of this observable performed so far.IntroductionSingle transverse-spin asymmetries have been observed in several processes involving polarized protons or neutrons [1] , such as inclusive pion production [2] , semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering [3] , Drell-Yan lepton pair production [4] , prompt photon production [5] , and direct photons [6] . These measurements provide important information about the spin structure of nucleons [7, 8] .In particular, they can be used to test the validity of factorization theorems [9] which relate hard-scattering cross sections to partonic distributions inside the proton [10] . In addition, these observables may also shed light on new physics beyond the Standard Model [11] .For example, it has recently been suggested [12] that large single-spin asymmetries could arise due to the interference of two amplitudes describing different helicities of quarks emitted from longitudinally polarized gluons in high-energy pp collisions. Such effects would violate parity conservation and thus constitute evidence for new physics [13] . However, there exists only one previous measurement [14] of single-spin asymmeties in hadronic dijet production at high energies. That study was carried out at RHIC [15] where the center-of-mass energy per nucleon-nucleon collision √sNN=200 GeV is much lower",1,0
"We present the results of our analysis on the time-averaged spectrum and light curve of GRB 090902B, which is one of the brightest bursts ever detected by Fermi/GBM (Gamma-ray Burst Monitor). We find that its average spectrum can be well fitted with two blackbody functions plus an additional power-law component at high energies. The temperature of each blackbody function decreases as the emission radius increases. This behavior is consistent with theoretical predictions for photospheric emission from relativistic outflows. In addition to this thermal component, we also detect non-thermal emission above 100 MeV. Our spectral fitting suggests that there are three distinct physical regions contributing to the observed gamma-rays: 1) A photosphere-like region producing thermal radiation; 2) An internal shock region generating nonthermal radiation; 3) A magnetized wind region responsible for high-energy photons. These findings provide new insights into the physics of GRBs.Keywords: Black body, Photon index, Power law",1,0
"We present new results on thermal inertia measurements of NEAs based on infrared observations with Spitzer Space Telescope (SST). We use these data to derive an improved estimate of the mean value of the surface thermal inertia, I = 100 ± 50 J m-2 s-1/2 K-1, which is in good agreement with previous estimates obtained by other authors using different methods. The derived values are also consistent with laboratory experiments performed at high temperatures that show how the thermal conductivity decreases as temperature increases. Using our measured range of thermal inertias we calculate the expected range of magnitudes of the Yarkovsky force acting upon NEAs. Our calculations suggest that this force may be responsible for driving some NEAs into orbits crossing Earth's orbit. This would have important consequences for future space missions aimed at deflecting potentially hazardous objects away from Earth. Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs) represent a significant threat to human civilization because they can impact the Earth within one million years. In order to mitigate such threats it will be necessary to develop technologies capable of deflecting or redirecting NEAs out of their current orbits before they hit the Earth. One possible method involves applying a small impulse to the asteroid's trajectory through the action of the Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) effect. However, the effectiveness of this approach depends critically on the ability to predict accurately the strength of the YORP effect.",1,0
"We present an ab initio method for the calculation of phonon dispersion relations in solids, which is based on the direct solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) and includes electron-phonon interaction effects beyond the adiabatic approximation. The BSE describes the scattering between pairs of valence electrons mediated by screened Coulomb interactions. We solve this equation using a recently developed scheme that allows us to treat large supercells with high accuracy. In order to account for nonadiabatic corrections we introduce a self-consistent treatment of electronic screening into our approach. This enables us to calculate accurate phonon dispersions at arbitrary points in reciprocal space without any additional computational effort compared to standard DFT calculations. As a first application of our new method we study the influence of electron-phonon interaction on the band gap renormalization in silicon. Our results show good agreement with experimental data and previous theoretical studies.",1,0
"The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the largest funder of biomedical research in the United States, but it also supports non-biomedical research through its extramural program.The NIH has funded thousands of scientists at hundreds of institutions across the country to conduct basic science research that may have important applications outside of medicine.This study examines how these researchers are using their NIH funding for non-biomedical projects by analyzing data collected during interviews with them conducted as part of an ongoing longitudinal survey of NIH-funded investigators.We find that many of these scientists use their NIH funds primarily or exclusively for non-biomedically related research activities such as teaching, administration, and service work.However, we also find that some scientists who receive NIH support for non-biomedics-related research still spend most of their time conducting biomedically focused research.In addition, our results show that scientists' perceptions about whether they are spending more time doing biomedically versus non-biomedically focused research do not always match up with actual behavior.",1,0
"We present an analysis of cosmogenic neutrino fluxes expected in IceCube for different models of cosmic ray sources and propagation, including recent results on anisotropy measurements by PAMELA and AMS-02 experiments. We show that these data can be used to discriminate between various scenarios of cosmic ray origin and propagation. In particular we find that:- The observed anisotropies are consistent with predictions based on conventional astrophysical acceleration mechanisms only if one assumes very hard injection spectra at source (with spectral index below -2). This is inconsistent with observations of other messengers such as gamma-rays or radio waves.- If one allows for more exotic particle physics processes like decaying dark matter particles then it becomes possible to explain both the observed anisotropies and the spectrum of cosmic rays without violating any observational constraints. However this scenario requires fine-tuning of parameters which makes it less appealing than conventional astrophysics explanations.",1,0
"We present new results for light element abundances (Li, Be and B) in two metal-poor stars belonging to the Galactic Globular Cluster M4. The observed abundance patterns are compared with predictions based on standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis theory as well as those obtained by assuming that these elements were produced during hydrostatic burning phases in massive AGB stars. We find that both scenarios fail to reproduce simultaneously all three measured elemental ratios at metallicities below [Fe/H] = -2.0 dex. This suggests that additional processes must be responsible for producing LiBeB in this cluster.These findings provide important clues about the origin of light elements in low-metallicity environments such as dwarf galaxies or primordial gas clouds. In particular, they suggest that the production mechanisms may have been different than previously thought. Finally, we discuss possible implications of our results for the formation history of globular clusters.",1,0
"In this work, we study the problem of finding an optimal set of points in a Grassmann manifold that are equidistant to each other with respect to some distance measure. We propose two algorithms for solving this problem: one based on random sampling and another based on gradient descent. The first algorithm is shown to be efficient when the number of dimensions is large compared to the number of points required; however it does not scale well as the dimension increases. On the other hand, our second approach scales better but requires more iterations than the first method. Finally, numerical experiments show that both methods perform similarly in practice. This research was supported by NSERC Discovery Grants RGPIN-2014-04567 (A.S.) and RGPIN-2016-05189 (M.D.).IntroductionLet Gr(k,n) denote the Grassmannian manifold consisting of all k-dimensional subspaces of ℝ^n. In many applications such as signal processing or machine learning, one needs to find a subset of points in Gr(k, n) which are close together according to some metric.For example, consider the following scenario where one wants to transmit data over multiple channels simultaneously using space-time coding techniques. Here, the transmitter encodes information into a vector of symbols drawn from a finite alphabet 𝒜. Then, these vectors can be transmitted across different antennas at the same time. However, if there are too few antennas available then the receiver may experience poor performance due to interference between signals received through adjacent antennas. To overcome this issue, one could use multi-antenna transmission schemes whereby the transmitter sends several independent streams of information across different antennas. These streams would correspond to different points in Gr(1,N), where N denotes the total number of antennas used. Another application involves compressive sensing problems where one seeks to recover a sparse vector x from its noisy measurements y given by:y = Ax + w",1,0
"The concept of defects in crystals has been developed by the Russian school since the 1930s. The main idea is that any crystal can be considered as an elastic continuum with some local deviations from its ideal structure which are called defects. In this work we present a brief review on the history of the development of the theory of defects in solids. We also discuss the modern concepts of point-like defects (dislocations), line-like defects (disclinations) and continuous defects. Finally, we give examples of how these ideas have been applied to different physical systems such as liquid crystals or magnetic materials. Defects play an important role in many areas of physics ranging from solid state physics to condensed matter physics and even biology. They appear naturally during phase transitions between ordered states like those occurring at melting points or critical temperatures. For example, they may lead to plastic deformations in metals or glassy materials. On the other hand, defects are responsible for macroscopic properties of solids like electrical conductivity or magnetization.",1,0
"In this note, we present an elementary proof for the following theorem due to Pappus: Theorem 1 (Pappus' theorem). Let ABC be any triangle and let D be its incenter. Then the three medians AD, BE, and CF intersect at one point K inside the triangle.Proof. We first prove that the line segments AB, BC, and CA are concurrent in one point K by using only basic geometry. The idea is as follows. Consider the circle C_1 centered at A with radius AC. Similarly consider circles C_2 and C_3 centered at B and C respectively with radii BD and CD. Note that all these three circles have their centers on the same side of the triangle ABC. Now if we draw lines through A', B', and C' which are intersection points between the circumcircles of triangles ABC and A_1B_1C_1, A_2B_2C_2, and A_3B_3C_3 then it can easily be seen that they will meet at one common point K.",1,0
"We prove that if a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism is homotopic to an automorphism, then it has no periodic points in its Julia set.This result implies that any such map can be approximated by a linear Anosov diffeomorphism with respect to the Teichmüller metric and hence gives another proof of Thurston's classification of surfaces.We also show how this result leads to a new proof of the fact that the mapping class group acts properly discontinuously on the space of measured laminations (and thus on the space of all measured foliations) when restricted to those which are not supported on multicurves.The first author would like to thank his advisor Professor Richard S. Hamilton for suggesting this problem as well as many helpful discussions throughout the course of this work. The second author would like to thank Professor David Gabai for several useful conversations during the preparation of this manuscript.",1,0
"We give an explicit description of the higher algebraic K-groups in terms of certain universal cohomology classes, which are defined by using only the ring structure and the unit element of the underlying commutative ring. This is done for any commutative ring with unity R (not necessarily Noetherian). The main result can be formulated as follows: Let M be a module over R. Then there exists a natural isomorphism between the higher algebraic K-groups:K_n(R) = Ext^n_R(M, R) and the group of all n-fold Massey products on M modulo those that vanish under some suitable finiteness condition. We also show how this theorem leads to a new proof of Quillen's localization theorem. Finally we discuss applications to the study of equivariant K-theory. In particular, we prove that if G is a compact Lie group acting freely on a smooth manifold X then the equivariant K-theory groups of X are isomorphic to the ordinary K-theory groups of the fixed point set X^G.",1,0
"We present the discovery, photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2005hj (PTF10ygu), an apparently normal-bright Type Ia supernova discovered by PTF in late March 2005 at z = 0.084. The light curve shows two distinct peaks separated by about one month with no evidence for interaction between ejecta and circumstellar material. We find that this object is consistent with being a member of the class of 'normal-bright' SNe Ia defined by Phillips et al. (1999) but has a higher peak luminosity than most members of this class. Using our own data as well as published results we estimate the distance to SN 2005hj using three different methods. All three give distances which are inconsistent with each other within their uncertainties. This may be due to systematic errors or it could indicate that there exists more than one subclass of 'normal-bright' objects. If confirmed, these findings have important implications for cosmological studies based on SNe Ia.Keywords: Supernovae",1,0
"We present the results of our study on coriolis effects on the global oscillation modes (g-modes) in magnetized white dwarfs using one-dimensional, fully compressible numerical simulations with realistic equation-of-state and opacities. We find that the effect is significant for low-order g-modes but negligible for high-order ones. The frequency shifts are found to be proportional to the mode inertia which can be estimated by fitting the eigenfunctions obtained numerically into those calculated analytically under the thin-shell approximation. For typical parameters relevant to ZZ Ceti stars, we estimate the frequency shift due to coriolis forces to be about 0.1 ",1,0
"We study the concentration-mass relation for dark matter haloes in cosmological N-body simulations with different initial conditions and resolutions, focusing on the dependence on halo mass and redshift. We find that the concentrations are well described by an empirical formula proposed recently by Navarro et al. (2004) : c = c0(M/M0)^a(z), where M is the virial mass of the halo, z its formation time (defined as the epoch when half of the final mass was assembled into progenitors), c0 ,a and M0 are free parameters to be determined numerically. The best-fit values of these parameters depend only weakly on the simulation resolution or the initial power spectrum index n. In particular, we show that the value of a0 is independent of both n and the numerical resolution. This result suggests that the concentration of dark matter haloes may not be universal but depends on their formation history.",1,0
"We report on point contact Andreev reflection (PCAR) measurements performed on single crystals of the heavy fermion compound HoNi2B2C, which is an antiferromagnet with T N = 1.5 K that becomes a type-II superconductor below Tc = 0.8 K. The PCAR spectra show clear evidence for multiple gaps at low temperatures. We find two distinct gap values, one of them being close to twice the value of the other. This observation suggests that there are two different bands crossing the Fermi level. In addition we observe a temperature dependence of both gaps indicating their nodal character. Our results provide further insight into the electronic structure of this material. Heavy-fermion compounds have attracted considerable interest over recent years because they often exhibit unconventional physical properties such as non-Fermi liquid behavior or even quantum criticality [1] . These materials can be described by the periodic Anderson model [2] , where conduction electrons hybridize strongly with localized f -electrons leading to the formation of narrow bands near the Fermi energy E F [3] . HoNi 2 B 2 C belongs to the family of so-called borocarbides [4] . It crystallizes in the tetragonal ThCr 2 Si 2 structure [5] and has been shown to become a type-II superconductor [6] below T c ≈ 0.8 K [7, 8] . At ambient pressure it orders magnetically around T N = 1.6 K [9] . Recent studies suggest that the magnetic order is driven by strong spin-orbit coupling [10] . A number of experiments indicate that the ground-state wave function consists of singlet pairs [11, 12] . However, the exact nature of the pairing mechanism remains unclear [13] .",1,0
"We study the reflection of Alfven waves at the surface of a rotating star with an inclined magnetic field, which is relevant to the problem of coronal heating by MHD turbulence generated near the stellar surface. We show that if the angle between the wave vector k and the normal n to the reflecting surface satisfies cos(k·n) > 1 (over-reflection), then there exists a critical frequency ωcr = √ 2Ω above which no Alfven waves can propagate into the interior region of the star. This leads to the formation of standing waves on the surface of the star whose amplitude grows exponentially as time goes on. The growth rate depends only weakly on the inclination angle θB of the magnetic field lines but strongly on the density contrast across the surface layer. For typical parameters of the Sun we find that the exponential growth starts after about one day for θB = 60 degrees and after about ten days for θB = 90 degrees.",1,0
"We study effects of the axial U(1) A anomaly in the two-flavor lattice QCD with Wilson fermions at finite temperature and density by using the Polyakov-loop extended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model. We find that the PNJL results are consistent with those obtained by the standard NJL model, which does not include the anomaly effect explicitly. The critical chemical potential for the onset of diquark condensation is shifted to larger values due to the anomaly effect. This shift becomes smaller as we increase the current quark mass. In addition, the magnitude of the diquark condensate decreases when the anomaly term is included.PACS numbers: 11.10.Wx, 12.38.Gc, 14.40.NdIntroduction: It has been known that the axial U(1)Here mq denotes the current quark mass.",1,0
"We present new HST/ACS observations of four nearby Fanaroff-Riley type-I (FR I) radio galaxies, 3C 31, 3C 264, 4C+55.17 and PKS 0745-191 . We use these data to study their nuclear properties by means of aperture photometry and image decomposition techniques. The results show that all sources have an unresolved core component with typical luminosities between 1040-1050 erg s-1 Hz-1 at rest-frame 5100 Å , which is consistent with previous studies based on ground-based near-infrared spectroscopy. In addition we find evidence for extended emission around the nucleus in two out of four objects studied here. This extended emission has been previously detected only in one other FR I galaxy, namely M 87. Our analysis shows that this extended emission can be explained as scattered light from the central source. Finally, our results suggest that the observed polarization fraction increases towards shorter wavelengths, indicating that dust extinction plays an important role in determining the intrinsic polarization properties of these systems.",1,0
"We propose to probe the nature of dark energy by correlating the morphological properties of galaxies in the nearby universe (z < 0.1) as measured by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), with those at higher redshifts, z1, obtained from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). We use steerable wavelet transforms on galaxy images to obtain morphological parameters such as concentration index, asymmetry index, Gini coefficient etc., which are then correlated with their counterparts derived from WMAP data using the same technique. The results show that these correlations can be used to discriminate between different models for dark energy. This is an extension of our earlier work where we have shown how one can correlate the morphology of galaxies in SDSS with CMB fluctuations observed by WMAP. In this work, we present detailed analysis of various statistical tests performed on simulated datasets generated under different cosmological scenarios.",1,0
"We study the dynamics on networks where nodes are connected by both short-range and long-range interactions, which can be either attractive or repulsive. We show that in this case there is no phase transition between ordered and disordered phases as it was observed for purely local interaction models. Instead we find an intermediate regime characterized by strong fluctuations of order parameters. The critical behavior at the boundary to the ordered state depends crucially on whether the long-range interactions are attractive or repulsive. In particular, if they are repulsive then the system exhibits mean-field-like criticality while for attractive long-range interactions one finds non-trivial exponents similar to those found previously for purely local systems.I. INTRODUCTIO N The concept of self-organized criticality (SOC) has been introduced recently [1] . It describes a class of dynamical systems whose evolution leads them into states close to equilibrium without any fine tuning of control parameters [2] . In SOC systems, the appearance of power-law distributions of avalanche sizes [3] , relaxation times [4] , etc., is explained by assuming that these systems evolve towards their critical point [5] . This idea has been applied successfully to many different physical phenomena [6] including earthquakes [7] , forest fires [8] , traffic jams [9] , sandpiles [10] , neural networks [11] , epidemics [12] , population dynamics [13] , etc.. Recently, several authors have studied the effect of nonlocal interactions on the properties of SOC systems [14 -17] . They showed that nonlocal interactions lead to new interesting effects such as the absence of phase transitions [17] , the existence of multiple absorbing states [14] , and the possibility of having spatially localized solutions [15] . However, all previous studies were restricted to the case when only nearest-neighbor interactions exist. Here we consider more general cases when the network contains also long-range interactions.",1,0

"The Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS) is an array of four 12m diameter imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes located at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory in southern Arizona, USA. The instrument was designed to detect gamma rays with energies between 100 GeV and 30 TeV. In this work we report on observations made by VERITAS during 2005-2007 that reveal very high energy emission from the black hole binary system Cygnus X-1. We find evidence for two distinct spectral components; one peaking near 1 TeV and another extending up to 20 TeV. These results are consistent with previous measurements made using other instruments such as MAGIC and HEGRA. This source has been observed previously but never before detected above 10 TeV. Our data also show significant variability over timescales ranging from minutes to months. Finally, we present preliminary results from our analysis of archival data taken prior to 2005 which suggest that there may be additional periods when Cygnus X-1 emits VHE radiation.",1,0
"We present an analysis of high-resolution near-infrared images obtained with NACO/VLT and SPHERE/ZIMPOL/ESO to study the photometric variability of the exoplanet HD 189733b in its transit across the stellar disk. We find that the planet's brightness varies by more than one magnitude between phases 0.8-0.9, which is consistent with previous results based on lower resolution data. The observed phase curve shows two maxima at phases 0.85 and 0.95, indicating that the planet has a strong east-west temperature gradient. This result can be explained if we assume that the planet orbits close to edge-on (i = 85°) and that it receives most of its energy from the star through a single hemisphere. In this case, the planet would have a large day/night temperature difference of about 1000 K. Our observations also show evidence for a small hot spot located near the substellar point.",1,0
"We have analyzed new photometric data for two AM CVn-type systems, HP Librae (=PG 1336-018) and V803 Cen, obtained with the Kepler space telescope in order to determine their orbital periods more accurately than before.We find that both systems are eclipsing binaries with very short orbital periods of only P orb = 81.6 min for HP Librae and P orb = 80.3 min for V803 Cen. The light curves show deep primary minima which we interpret as being caused by total eclipses of the accretion disks around the white dwarfs. In addition, there is evidence for an additional eclipse feature at phase 0.5-0.7 in the case of HP Librae. This could be due either to partial eclipses or occultations of one component by another. For comparison purposes, we also present results on the previously known system CR Boo.",1,0
"We present an update to our previous analysis [1] , where we used the most recent experimental results for the W and Z boson masses, M W = 80.385 ± 0.025 GeV [2] and M Z = 91.1876 ± 0.0021 GeV [3] . We also use the new value for the top quark mass m t = 172.7 ± 1.1 GeV [4] . The main goal is to determine the parameters in the effective lagrangian describing the interactions between quarks and leptons at low energies. The relevant terms are given bywhere L SM denotes the Standard Model (SM) part of the lagrangian, O i are dimension-six operators with coefficients c i which can be determined experimentally or calculated using perturbation theory. In this work we will only consider operators that contribute to fermion-boson vertices. For more details see Ref. [5] .

"The physisorption of nucleobases (adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine) onto graphene is investigated by density functional theory calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level in vacuum conditions. The results show that all four bases are adsorbed on the surface with different binding energies ranging between -0.27 eV for adenine to -1.10 eV for cytosine. In addition, it was found that the adsorption energy decreases as the number of nitrogen atoms increases. This indicates that the interaction strength depends strongly on the electronegativity of the base molecules. It has been shown that the most stable configuration corresponds to an end-on orientation where the carbonyl oxygen atom interacts directly with one of the C-C bonds of the graphene sheet.Keywords: Physisorption; Graphene; Nucleobase; Density Functional Theory Calculations. IntroductionGraphene is a two-dimensional material consisting of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms arranged into a honeycomb lattice structure [1] . Due to its unique electronic properties such as high carrier mobility [2] , large specific surface area [3] , thermal conductivity [4] , mechanical flexibility [5] , chemical stability [6] and biocompatibility [7, 8] , this material has attracted considerable attention over recent years [9] . However, despite these advantages, there have been some challenges associated with the use of pristine graphene sheets due to their hydrophobic nature [10] which limits their applications [11] . Therefore, many efforts have been made towards modifying the physical and chemical characteristics of graphene through various approaches including covalent [12] or non-covalent [13] functionalization [14] .In particular, non-covalent functionalization can be achieved via π-π interactions [15] , hydrogen bonding [16] , electrostatic [17] , van der Waals [18] and ionic [19] forces [20] . Among them, π-π stacking is considered to be the strongest noncovalent force [21] . For example, several studies have reported that aromatic compounds [22] , fullerenes [23] , porphyrins [24] , metal complexes [25] and biomolecules [26] could interact with graphene surfaces via π-",1,0
"We study the problem of reconstructing evolutionary histories that contain both reticulation events and vertical transmission, where reticulations are represented by hybridization or horizontal gene transfer (HGT). We show how to use maximum parsimony to find an optimal solution for this problem in polynomial time when all input trees have bounded degree. This is achieved through a novel dynamic programming algorithm which computes the minimum number of reticulation events needed to explain each set of taxa on every tree in the input collection. Our approach can be used as part of a larger method for inferring species networks using collections of rooted binary phylogenies inferred from different types of data such as DNA sequences, morphological characters, fossil records etc., and it may also provide insights into the evolution of complex organisms like viruses and bacteria.IntroductionThe reconstruction of evolutionary relationships among biological entities has been one of the central problems in biology since Darwin's On the Origin of Species was published 150 years ago [1] . The most widely accepted model of evolution assumes that new species evolve over time via vertical transmission -that is, they pass their genetic material down directly from parent to offspring [2] . However, there are many cases where we cannot assume that evolution proceeds strictly vertically; instead, some form of horizontal gene transfer (HG T) occurs between two lineages [3] , resulting in what is known as reticulate evolution [4] . For example, if a virus infects a bacterium, then its genes will be passed horizontally across the host cell membrane [5] ; similarly, if a plant hybridizes with another plant [6] , then the offspring inherits genetic material from both parents [7, 8] . In these examples, the process of HGT results in a network-like relationship between the descendants of the original ancestor(s), rather than a strict hierarchy [9] .",1,0
"We report on the measurement of transverse polarization for lambda (Λ) hyperon production in quasireal photoproduction at Jefferson Lab, using data collected with the CLAS detector during Hall B running periods E94-110 and E97-107.The results are presented as functions of the photon virtuality Q^2, the invariant mass W of the final state system, and the angle θ_K between the normal to the scattering plane and the direction of the kaon produced in association with the hyperon.We find that the magnitude of the transverse polarization decreases rapidly with increasing Q^2 but is relatively insensitive to changes in W or θ_K.These observations are consistent with theoretical predictions based on perturbative QCD calculations performed within the framework of collinear factorization.

"We study the dynamics of an interface driven by a periodic external force in one dimension, using molecular dynamics simulations with Lennard-Jones particles at low temperatures (T = 0.1 − 1). We find that the interface moves as a whole when it is driven slowly enough; otherwise, it breaks into several segments which move independently. The number of segments increases with increasing driving frequency or decreasing temperature. In addition to these two regimes, we observe another regime where the interface exhibits stick-slip motion. This third regime occurs for intermediate values of the driving amplitude A and driving frequency f . For this regime, we show that there exists a scaling relation between the average velocity V , the driving frequency f , and the driving amplitude A: V ∝ Af 2 . Finally, we propose a simple model based on the concept of phonon-enhanced diffusion to explain our results. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevE.77.020101",1,0
"We have investigated the coupling between magnetic ordering and structural instability in BiFeO3 by using density functional theory (DFT). We find that ferroelectricity is induced by spin-current mechanism, which can be understood as follows. The Fe-3d orbitals hybridize with O-2p orbitals to form bonding and antibonding states near Fermi level. When spins are parallel along z-direction, the antibonding state lies above Fermi energy while the bonding state below it. This leads to an increase of electron charge at Bi-6s orbital and decrease at O-2p orbital on one side of unit cell, resulting in polarization pointing towards this side. On the other hand, when spins are antiparallel along z-direction, both antibonding and bonding states lie below Fermi energy leading to no net polarization. In addition, we also found that there exists strong spin-phonon interaction due to large magnetostriction effect.",1,0
"We study statistics of conductance oscillations in open quantum dots with electron-phonon interaction and dephasing time saturation at high temperatures. We show that this effect leads to appearance of new peaks in the distribution function of conductance fluctuations, which are absent for noninteracting electrons or when the dephasing time is not saturated. The positions of these peaks depend on temperature and dot size. This dependence can be used as an experimental tool for studying phonons in open quantum dots.IntroductionIn recent years there has been growing interest in transport through mesoscopic systems such as semiconductor nanowires [1] , carbon nanotubes [2] , graphene [3] . These structures have unique properties due to their small dimensions (of order 10 nm) [4] . For example, they exhibit ballistic [5] and coherent [6] transport regimes [7, 8] .In particular, it was shown experimentally [9] that the amplitude of conductance fluctuations in open quantum dots depends strongly on temperature T and dot size L. It decreases rapidly with increasing T and decreasing L [10] . At low temperatures, the main contribution to conductance fluctuations comes from interference effects [11] . However, at higher temperatures, thermal averaging destroys phase coherence between different paths [12] . As a result, the amplitude of conductance fluctuation decreases exponentially with temperature [13] :",1,0
"We consider the statistical properties of nonstationary random acoustic and electromagnetical waves in terms of their correlation functions, power spectra, and probability density functions (PDFs). We show that these quantities can be expressed by means of solutions to certain partial differential equations with time-dependent coefficients. The PDFs are obtained for both stationary and nonstationary cases using the method of characteristics. In particular, we derive an exact expression for the PDF of the amplitude fluctuations of a monochromatic plane wave propagating through a turbulent medium. This result is used to obtain expressions for the mean-square fluctuation levels of the electric field strength and intensity at any point along the propagation path. Finally, we discuss some applications of our results to radiowave scintillation theory and radar detection problems. PACS: 42.65.Tg, 43.20 .Fx, 47.55.+q, 47.60.+j",1,0
"We present an analysis of the temperature dependence of thermally stimulated luminescent (TSL) glow curves in terms of the nonstationary electron-phonon relaxation theory, which does not assume that the system is close to equilibrium at any time during its evolution.We show how this approach can be used for extracting information about the phonon spectrum and the density of states of charge carriers from TSL data obtained on different types of materials. The results are compared with those obtained by other methods such as photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy or Raman scattering. In particular we demonstrate that our method allows one to determine the energy gap between the conduction band minimum and valence band maximum in semiconductors. This work was supported by Russian Science Foundation grant No. 14-50-00040. DOI: 10.1063/1.4935190I. INTRODUCTORY REMARK The study of luminescence phenomena has been attracting considerable attention over many years because it provides valuable information about electronic structure and optical properties of solids [1] . Thermal stimulation luminescence (TSL), also known as optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), is particularly useful since it enables us to probe the distribution function of electrons excited into the conduction band [2] . In recent decades there have been numerous attempts to develop theoretical models describing various aspects of luminescence processes [3] , including thermal stimulation luminescence [4] - [8] . However, most of these works were based on the assumption that the system under consideration is always close to equilibrium [9] . As a result they cannot describe correctly some important features observed experimentally [10] . For example, the shape of the TSL glow curve depends strongly on the type of material [11] : while in insulators it usually exhibits a single peak [12] , in metals it often consists of several peaks [13] . Moreover, even within the same class of materials, e.g., semiconductor crystals [14] , the number of peaks may vary depending on the doping level [15] . These observations cannot be explained using existing theories [16] .",1,0
"We show that the electron-phonon interaction can lead to unconventional Cooper pairs in materials with strong spin-orbit coupling and broken inversion symmetry, even if only conventional phonon modes are present.We consider two different models for such materials: (i) Rashba semiconductors where the conduction band is split into spin-up and -down subbands due to an electric field perpendicular to the plane of the crystal; and (ii) topological insulators which have a single Dirac cone at their surface but exhibit time-reversal-symmetry breaking on the surface or in proximity to magnetic impurities. In both cases we find that the effective low-energy theory contains a term proportional to (ψ⃗^†ψ⃗)^2, where ψ denotes the fermionic annihilation operator corresponding to electrons near the Fermi level. This leads to unconventional s-wave pairing between electrons belonging to opposite spins and momenta.",1,0
"We study the stability properties of circumnuclear disks (CNDs) embedded within elliptical galaxies, using N-body simulations with live dark matter halos and stellar components. We find that CNDs are generally stable against bar formation for most reasonable disk parameters. However, we also show that if the central black hole is massive enough to dominate the gravitational potential at small radii, then it can induce strong bars or even destroy the entire disk. This result suggests that the presence of a supermassive black hole may be responsible for some observed nuclear bars in nearby elliptical galaxies.Keywords: Gravitational instability; Black holes; Bars; Nuclear activity; Galaxy evolution; Disk galaxies; Dark matter halos; Stellar dynamics; Cosmology1 IntroductionThe existence of nuclear bars has been inferred observationally by several authors based on photometric data (e.g., Laine et al. 2002; Erwin 2004) . In particular, ErwinSparke (2003) found that about half of their sample of early-type galaxies have nuclear bars. These results suggest that nuclear bars play an important role in galaxy evolution. For example, they could provide fuel for active galactic nuclei through gas inflow into the center of the host galaxy (Shlosman et al. 1990 ). On the other hand, there are only few observational studies which directly detect nuclear bars via high-resolution imaging techniques such as HST observations (Erwin 2004; Sheth et al. 2005) , mainly due to technical difficulties associated with resolving very compact structures near the centers of distant galaxies. Therefore, theoretical investigations of the dynamical behavior of nuclear bars will help us understand how these objects evolve over time.2 Previous WorkSeveral previous works studied the stability of nuclear bars in elliptical galaxies. Athanassoula et al. (2005a) performed numerical experiments where they added a rigidly rotating spherical component representing a bulge to a model consisting of a live halo and a rigidly rotating disk. They showed that this system becomes unstable when the mass ratio between the bulge and the disk exceeds a critical value",1,0
"We present the results of our second survey to find very low mass binaries using lucky imaging with the Palomar Observatory 1.2 m telescope and the PALM-3000 camera. We have discovered thirteen new systems, including ten brown dwarf companions (four previously unknown) in twelve nearby young open clusters ranging in age between 10 Myr and 300 Myr. The masses range from 0.03-0.10 M . These are among the lowest-mass objects ever found by direct imaging techniques. In addition we report on one system that is likely an unresolved binary consisting of two late-type stars. This work represents the largest sample of directly imaged brown dwarfs assembled so far. It will be used as input into population synthesis models aimed at understanding how these objects form and evolve over time.Keywords: Brown Dwarf, Open Cluster, Direct Imaging, Lucky Imaging, Nearby Stars",1,0
"We present galaxy colours derived from the AKARI/IRC deep survey data taken at 9 and 18 micron bands (hereafter, D9D18). The sample consists of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts z < 0.7 selected by their optical counterparts detected in the Subaru/Suprime-Cam B J -band image. We compare our results to those obtained for Spitzer/MIPS 24 µm-selected galaxies at similar redshift ranges. Our main findings are as follows: (1) Galaxies show bimodal colour distributions both in D9/D18 and D9/D24 planes. (2) In the D9/D18 plane, we find that most of the galaxies have blue or greenish colours while only few galaxies exhibit reddish colours.(3) In the D9-D18 vs. D9-D24 plane, there is no clear correlation between two colours except for very bright objects which tend to be bluer than fainter ones.

"We present results on testing different outer boundary conditions in numerical relativity, using two black hole spacetimes as testbeds.In particular we consider the case where one or both holes are spinning and use several coordinate systems to evolve these solutions numerically.We find that the choice of coordinates can have significant effects on the accuracy with which the solution is recovered at large distances from the source region. The most accurate results were obtained by evolving the initial data sets in Kerr-Schild Cartesian coordinates (KSC). However, even when evolved in KSC it was found necessary to impose additional constraints near the outer boundaries in order to obtain stable evolutions over many dynamical timescales. These constraints effectively remove all gravitational radiation from the computational domain. Finally, we also considered an alternative approach based on excision techniques. This method involves removing the interior regions containing singularities from the computational grid and replacing them with suitable analytic expressions.",1,0
"BiFeO3 is an antiferromagnetic insulator with high Curie temperature (TC = 1103 K) that exhibits ferroelectricity at room temperature when doped or under pressure. Here we report the observation of spontaneous magnetization, M(T), and electrical polarization, P(E), simultaneously existing over wide ranges of temperatures up to 300 K in pure BiFeO3 single crystal grown by flux method. The results show that both M(T) and P(E) are nearly independent on each other below TC but they start to decrease rapidly above TC. We also found that the magnitude of M(T) decreases faster than that of P(E). These observations suggest that there exists strong coupling between spin and lattice degrees of freedom in this material.Keywords: Room-temperature multiferroic materials, BiFeO3, Electric polarization, Magnetic properties, Flux growth technique.",1,0
"The Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope is scheduled to be launched in June 2008 and will perform high energy gamma ray astronomy for at least 3 years. The LAT consists of 4 identical towers, each with tracker and calorimeter subsystems. Each tower has an anti-coincidence detector that covers its entire surface area. In addition there are two instruments dedicated to detecting bursts of gamma rays -the GBM and the LAT itself. The GBM is composed of 12 sodium iodide scintillation crystals read out by photomultiplier tubes. It is designed to detect GRBs over a wide range of energies between 8 keV and 1 MeV. This work presents results obtained during ground calibration tests performed on all four GBM detectors prior to launch. We present data taken using radioactive sources as well as cosmic muons. These data were used to determine the response functions of the detectors which can then be used to reconstruct the incident photon fluxes.",1,0
"We study the ground state properties of fermions interacting via attractive four-fermion interactions in two, three and four dimensions (2D, 3D and 4D). We show that for any dimension d > 1 there is always an energy gap between the lowest lying excitations and the ground state which implies that these systems are gapped insulators. In 2D we find that the system has a finite density of states at zero energy leading to a metallic phase with power law decaying correlations. The existence of this metallic phase can be understood by mapping our model onto a free fermionic theory using bosonization techniques. For 3D and 4D we argue that the system is either a Mott insulator or a charge density wave insulator depending on whether the Fermi surface encloses one or more than one electron per unit cell respectively. Finally we discuss how our results may be relevant to recent experiments studying strongly correlated materials such as high temperature superconductors.IntroductionStrongly correlated electronic systems have been studied extensively over many years both theoretically and experimentally [1] . One of the most interesting phenomena observed in these systems is the formation of ordered phases where electrons localize into spatially separated regions known as 'Cooper pairs' [2] , 'Mott insulating' [3] or 'Wigner crystal' [4] phases. These phases occur when the kinetic energy of the electrons cannot overcome their mutual Coulomb repulsion resulting in a suppression of the single particle spectral weight near the chemical potential [5] .In order to understand the physics behind these exotic phases it is important to develop theoretical tools capable of describing them accurately [6] . A powerful technique used to describe these types of problems is the so-called 'bosonization method' [7, 8] . This approach maps the original problem involving fermions to another problem involving bosons thereby allowing us to use standard methods developed for bosonic theories [9] . However, despite its successes, the bosonization method suffers from some drawbacks [10] . Firstly, it only works well if the number of fermions N is large compared to the correlation length ξ [11] . Secondly, even though the bosonized description",1,0
"We consider the following system of nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations (SPDE) in ℝ^d, where d∈ℕ is fixed and (Ω,ℱ,P) denotes some probability space:u_t - Δ u + f(u) = ξ_1(t),t ≥ 0, x ∈Ω_0v_t - Δ v + g(u) = η_2(t),t≥0,x∈Ω_1, where u and v are unknown functions on Ω_0 resp. Ω_1, which we assume to be open subsets of ℝ^d; f:ℝ→ℝ and g:ℝ→ℝ_≥0 are given smooth functions satisfying certain growth conditions at infinity, while ξ_1 and η_2 denote two independent Brownian motions on (Ω,ℱ, P).We prove that there exists an explicit formula for the hitting probabilities P_x(T_1<τ_x_0) and P_x(T_2<τ_x_0) associated with this SPDE-system, where x∈Ω_0, T_1,2>0 and τ_x_0=inf{t>0:u(t,x)=v(t,x)}.

"We present new near-infrared (NIR) spectra for red supergiants and giants, obtained at the European Southern Observatory in La Silla, Chile.The sample includes stars with spectral types ranging from M5 to M2Iab, luminosity classes III-V, and surface gravities between log g = 1.0 and 3.8 dex. We compare these observations with synthetic NIR spectra computed using MARCS model atmospheres that include mixing-induced chemical abundance changes near the stellar surface. Our results show that models including such effects are able to reproduce most observed features better than standard solar-scaled models. In particular, we find that the inclusion of mixing leads to an improved fit of the CO bandheads around 2.3 microns as well as of several atomic lines. However, some discrepancies remain which may be due to shortcomings in our current understanding of convection or other physical processes occurring close to the stellar surface.",1,0
"We present results on the statistical properties of earthquake sequences generated by the 2D Burridge-Knopff (BK) model with random initial conditions and periodic boundary conditions, using numerical simulations. We find that the BK model produces power-law distributions for both the inter-event time distribution and magnitude-frequency relation in agreement with observations. The exponent values are found to be dependent upon the system size N . In particular we show that the exponents decrease as 1/N , which is consistent with previous studies. Finally, we discuss possible reasons behind this dependence. Keywords: Earthquake statistics; Power laws; Random initial conditions; Periodic boundary conditions; Statistical mechanics; Numerical simulation; Burridge-Knopf model. 1 Introduction It has been known since Gutenberg's work [1] that there exists an empirical relationship between the frequency f of occurrence of earthquakes and their magnitudes M : log10(f ) = α − βM . ( The constants α and β depend on the region under consideration [2] . This relationship can also be expressed in terms of the number n of events per unit area A within some range [Mmin, Mmax] of magnitudes as: dn/dA ∝ 10 γ−δM min where dn/da ∝ 10 γ−αM max [3] . For example, if one considers all earthquakes occurring over a period of time T in a given geographical area then it follows that:where Ntot denotes the total number of earthquakes during the observation period T . If one instead counts only those earthquakes whose magnitude lies in the interval [Mmin, Mmax]:",1,0
"We present an analysis of chemical equilibrium and disequilibrium processes occurring in the atmospheres of substellar mass objects (SMBOs). We have developed a new method for calculating departures from chemical equilibrium, which is based on the assumption that all species are in local thermodynamic equilibrium with each other at any given point within the atmosphere. This approach allows us to calculate the abundances of individual molecular species as functions of altitude above the photosphere. The results show that there can be significant deviations from chemical equilibrium even under conditions where the gas temperature is much higher than the dust temperature. In particular, we find that carbon monoxide may become depleted by several orders of magnitude relative to its abundance predicted by chemical equilibrium models. These findings suggest that SMBO observations should take into account possible non-equilibrium effects when interpreting their spectra.Keywords: Chemical equilibrium; Dust grains; Local thermodynamic equilibrium",1,0
"We study numerically and analytically the dynamics of an elastic interface in two dimensions driven by thermal fluctuations, starting far away from equilibrium. We find that the system relaxes to its steady state via coarsening with power law growth of characteristic length scales. The exponents are determined both for the case where the initial condition is random noise as well as for the case when it has a regular pattern. In particular we show how the exponent depends on the strength of disorder present in the initial conditions. This work was supported by NSF grant DMR-0704520 (M.S.) and by DFG grant SFB-TR6 (A.K.).I. INTRODUCTORY REMARkSThe motion of interfaces between different phases or states plays an important role in many physical systems ranging from crystal growth [1] , fluid flow [2] , magnetic domain wall motion [3] , fracture [4] , wetting [5] , etc.. A common feature shared by all these phenomena is that they involve some kind of competition between surface tension which tries to smooth out any roughness at the interface and other driving forces such as gravity [6] , electric field [7] , chemical potential [8] , etc., which tend to make the interface roughen. It turns out that this competition leads to interesting nonequilibrium behavior [9] . For example, if one starts with flat surfaces then the presence of quenched disorder can lead to the formation of fractal structures [10] . In recent years there have been several studies [11] - [16] devoted to understanding the statistical properties of growing interfaces near their critical dimension d c = 2 [17] . These investigations were motivated primarily by experiments [18] - [20] performed on various types of thin films grown under controlled experimental conditions [21] . One of the main goals of these studies is to understand whether the scaling laws observed experimentally [22] - [24] are universal [25] or depend crucially on microscopic details [26] . Another motivation comes from theoretical interest in studying the interplay between nonlinearity and disorder [27] - [29] . Finally, another reason for investigating the problem theoretically is due to possible applications [30] - [32] in data storage devices [33] and optical",1,0
"We present spatially-resolved spectroscopic observations for the central regions (r < 1 kpc) of six nearby, massive early-type galaxies in clusters or groups with Mvir > 1013M⊙. The data were obtained using the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph on Gemini North telescope as part of our ongoing program to study the formation histories of these systems. We use the pPXF code to fit the observed spectra with single-single component models consisting of an old passively-evolving population plus a younger burst superimposed at different ages and metallicities. Our main results are summarized below:- All objects show evidence for multiple components in their line-of-sight velocity distributions.- In all cases we find that the best-fit model consists of two distinct components: one is dominated by older stars (age>8 Gyr), while the other has intermediate age (1-8 Gyr). - For four out of six targets, the second component shows higher metallicity than the first one.",1,0

"The heat capacity of lead sulfide (PbS) has been measured in the temperature range 1.8 to 300 K using adiabatic calorimetry and compared with that for lead selenide (PbSe). The results show that, at low temperatures, the heat capacities are dominated by phonon contributions which can be described within Debye theory. At higher temperatures, anharmonic effects become important leading to deviations between experiment and theory. In addition, we find evidence for isotopic effects on both lattice and electronic properties.These findings suggest that the use of lead chalcogenides as thermoelectric materials may require careful consideration of their thermal stability. Lead chalcogenides have attracted considerable interest recently due to their potential applications in thermoelectrics [1-3]. However, there is still much debate about how these compounds behave under different conditions [4] . This is partly because it is difficult to measure accurately the physical properties such as electrical conductivity or Seebeck coefficient over large ranges of temperature and doping concentration [5] . In this work, we report measurements of the specific heat capacity of two samples of lead sulfide (one natural abundance sample and one enriched in the heavier isotopes 206Pb and 207Pb), together with theoretical calculations based on density functional theory [6] , in order to investigate the effect of isotopic composition on the thermodynamic properties of lead chalcogenide semiconductors [7-9]. We also compare our experimental data with those obtained previously for lead selenide [10] .Our results demonstrate that the isotopic composition affects not only the lattice but also the electronic contribution to the total heat capacity.",1,0
"We present new observations of the distant galaxy cluster RX J1117.4+07431, which was discovered in the ROSAT All-Sky Survey data by Voges et al. (1999) . The cluster is located at redshift z = 0.485 ± 0.001 with an estimated mass M500 = 1.7 × 1013 h-1M⊙ within r500 = 2.1h-1Mpc .

These features may be associated with shock heating due to merging activity between sub-clusters or groups.",1,0
"The gravitational force between two objects is proportional to the product of their masses, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance separating them.The same relationship holds true for repulsive gravity as well.In this article we will examine how such an effect can be modeled using creation in place of mass.Creation is defined by Einstein's field equations as:G = 8πG/c4T00 where T00 represents the energy density of space-time.We will show that if one object has more creation than another then it exerts a greater repulsive force on its neighbor.This effect may explain why some stars are surrounded by dark matter while others do not. It also provides insight into the nature of black holes which have been observed to emit radiation but no light. Gravitational attraction occurs when two bodies exert mutual forces upon each other due to their respective masses.If body A has twice the mass of body B then it exerts double the force on body B compared to what body B exerts on itself.Similarly, if body C has three times the mass of body D then it exerts triple the force on body D compared to what body D exerts on itself.Force is measured in newtons (N) or dynes (dyne).",1,0
"We show that entropy production in quantum field theory is related to the vacuum energy density and its time evolution, which can be used as an indicator for the presence of dark energy. We consider two different models with varying degrees of complexity: (i) a scalar field model where we calculate the entropy production using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism; (ii) a more realistic model based on QED including fermions and photons. In both cases we find that the entropy production increases monotonically when the vacuum energy decreases over time. This behavior is consistent with our expectation that the universe becomes less ordered if it expands faster than usual due to the presence of dark energy.IntroductionThe accelerated expansion of the universe has been confirmed by many observations [1] . It is generally believed that this acceleration is driven by some form of 'dark energy' [2] , whose nature remains unknown. One possible explanation for such a phenomenon could be provided by the so-called 'quintessence' fields [3] - [4] . These are hypothetical scalar fields with negative pressure, which evolve slowly down their potential wells leading to a decrease in the vacuum energy density over time. Another possibility would be that the observed acceleration results from modifications of gravity at large distances [5] - [6] . However, there exist other explanations [7] - [8] .In order to distinguish between these possibilities one needs to develop new methods allowing us to probe the properties of dark energy directly [9] . Here we propose a novel approach based on the concept of entropy production [10] - [11] . Entropy measures how much disorder or randomness exists in a system [12] . If the universe accelerates because of dark energy then the rate of entropy production should increase accordingly. On the contrary, if the universe decelerates then the entropy production will slow down. Therefore, measuring the amount of entropy produced during the cosmic evolution may provide important information about the underlying physics responsible for the current state of the universe.In what follows we demonstrate that entropy production in quantum electrodynamics (QED), i.e., the interaction of electrons, positrons and photons, depends crucially on the value",1,0
"We report on an experiment that tests the predictions of quantum mechanics and local hidden variable theories for two entangled photons in a Bell state, using polarization-entanglement swapping to create a loophole-free Bell inequality violation.The experiment is performed with a source of polarization-entangled photon pairs produced by spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in a nonlinear crystal pumped by a continuous-wave laser at 405 nm.A half wave plate rotates one of the photons' polarizations by 45 degrees before it enters a beam splitter which separates the pair into two spatially separated beams.One of these beams passes through a quarter wave plate oriented such that its fast axis makes an angle of 22.5 degrees relative to horizontal; this transforms the horizontally polarized component of the beam's electric field vector into vertically polarized light.After passing through another quarter wave plate whose fast axis is aligned with vertical, both components are transformed back into horizontally polarized light.This transformation can be represented as follows:H → V → H = HVH.The other beam travels directly to Alice's measurement station where she performs measurements along three different axes corresponding to projections onto the basis states |V>, |H>, and |D>, where D denotes diagonal.Bob measures his photon along four different axes corresponding to projections",1,0
"The Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA) is used to simulate light scattering by large spherical particles in this study. The DDA was first developed as an efficient method for calculating the interaction between electromagnetic waves and small particles, but it has been extended recently to calculate the interactions with large particles. In order to validate our numerical results obtained using the DDA code, we compare them against those calculated using Mie theory. We find that both methods agree well when the size parameter x = 2πa/λ < 100 where λ is the incident wavelength and a is the radius of the particle. However, there are some discrepancies observed at higher values of x due to the fact that the DDA assumes that the scatterers have sharp boundaries while the actual particles do not. Finally, we show how the angular distribution of scattered intensity changes as the size of the particle increases. This work will be useful for studying aerosol optical properties such as extinction efficiency and single-scattering albedo.",1,0

"The curvature of space-time is one of the most important quantities in general relativity, and it has been studied extensively for many years.In this work we present new bounds on the curvature of the universe that are derived by using only information about its large-scale structure.We show how these bounds can be used to constrain cosmological models with nontrivial geometries such as those containing extra dimensions or time-varying fundamental constants.The results presented here have implications not just for theoretical physics but also for observational astronomy and cosmology. General relativity (GR) describes gravity at all scales ranging from microscopic black holes to supermassive galaxies. It predicts that matter curves spacetime around itself, which causes light rays emitted from distant sources to bend towards each other. This effect was first observed over 100 years ago when astronomers noticed that the positions of stars near the edge of our galaxy were systematically shifted away from their expected locations based on Newton's theory of gravitation [1] . Since then, gravitational lensing has become an extremely powerful tool for studying dark matter [2] , testing GR [3] , constraining modified theories of gravity [4] , and measuring distances [5] . In addition to predicting the bending of light, GR also makes precise predictions about the geometry of spacetime [6] . For example, if you travel along a straight line through empty space, your path will remain straight even though there may be massive objects nearby [7, 8] . Similarly, if you look out into space far enough so that no matter exists, you should see nothing but flat, featureless space [9] . These predictions depend crucially on the fact that the metric describing the geometry of spacetime must satisfy Einstein's field equations [10] . However, despite decades of research, it remains unclear whether the universe actually obeys these equations [11] .",1,0
"The concept of dynamical 3-space is introduced in this review article as an alternative to the standard space-time picture of relativistic physics. The main idea behind it is that, instead of considering time and space separately, one should consider them together as a single entity called 'dynamical 3-space'. This new approach has several advantages over the traditional viewpoint; for example, it provides a natural explanation for why we experience time flow only forward (and not backward), while at the same time allowing us to preserve causality. In addition, it also allows us to explain how particles can travel faster than light without violating any physical laws. Finally, by introducing the concept of 'quantum potential energy density' into our description of matter fields, we are able to provide a simple mathematical framework within which all known fundamental interactions between elementary particles may be described. We conclude with some remarks on possible future research directions based upon this novel theoretical perspective.",1,0
"We report the discovery of an unusual object in the outer solar system that is likely to be composed primarily of ice particles. The new body, (65489) Ceto/Phorcys, was discovered by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer mission on September 24th 2010 at heliocentric distance of5 AU. It has been observed for more than two years with ground-based telescopes as well as space-borne observatories such as Spitzer Space Telescope and Herschel Space Observatory. We present our analysis of these data sets which reveal that this object is a binary Centaur whose components are locked into mutual tidal evolution. This unique combination of properties makes it one of only three known objects in the Solar System where both components have diameters larger than 100 km. Our results show that Phorcys is a very elongated ellipsoidal shape with dimensions of about 400 x 300 x 250 kilometers. Its surface temperature is estimated to be around -100 degrees Celsius.",1,0
"We present the results of an analysis of gravitational wave data collected by the LIGO and Virgo detectors during the first observing run (O1) in 2015, which includes two candidate events for binary neutron star mergers. We use these observations to test general relativity against alternative theories of gravity that predict deviations from GR at high curvature regimes such as those encountered near black holes or neutron stars. In particular we consider scalar-tensor theories where the coupling between matter fields and the metric is mediated by a light scalar field. These theories are motivated by string theory and have been studied extensively over many decades.For each event, we perform Bayesian model selection using simulated signals generated from both GR and several representative scalartensor theories. Our results show no evidence for deviations from GR within current uncertainties. However, this does not rule out all possible deviations from GR; it only rules out certain classes of deviations predicted by specific models.",1,0
"We present the results of an unbiased survey toward starless cores using the HCN hyperfine transitions at 1.42 GHz and 2.12 GHz with the Nobeyama 45 m telescope to probe inward motions within these objects. We detected emission lines from all targets, except for L1521F (Taurus), which is known as one of the coldest prestellar cores. From our observations we found that the line widths are narrower than those observed by single-dish telescopes. This suggests that there may be unresolved substructure or turbulence on small scales inside the cores. For most sources, the peak intensities of both frequencies agree well with each other; however, for some cases they show significant differences between them. These discrepancies can be explained if the core has a temperature gradient along its radius and/or if it contains multiple velocity components. Our analysis shows that the kinetic temperatures derived from the two different frequency data sets range from 10 K to 30 K.",1,0
"We study the effect of local optical phonons on the electronic transport properties of a quantum dot system by using the nonequilibrium Green's function method combined with the density functional theory (DFT). We find that the electron-phonon interaction can induce a strong enhancement to the Kondo resonance peak and lead to a significant reduction of the Kondo temperature TK, which is determined as the energy scale at which the conductance reaches its maximum value Gmax. The results show that the Kondo temperature decreases rapidly when increasing the strength of the electron-phonon coupling constant λ. In addition, we also investigate how the Kondo temperature depends on the size of the quantum dots for different values of λ. Our findings may be useful for understanding the physical mechanism behind some recent experiments. Introduction:-The Kondo effect has been studied extensively both theoretically [1]-[3]and experimentally [4] - [6] . It occurs due to the formation of a many-body singlet state between localized magnetic moments and conduction electrons near the Fermi level [7, 8] , leading to a sharp zero-bias anomaly in the differential conductance [9] . Recently, it was found that this phenomenon could occur even without any magnetic impurities [10] - [12] . In fact, the Kondo effect has attracted much attention recently because of its potential applications in spintronics devices [13] - [16] . For example, the Kondo effect can be used to design novel spin transistors [17] or single-spin qubits [18] . However, there are still several open questions about the Kondo effect such as: How does the Kondo temperature depend on the size of the nanostructures? What happens if one introduces other degrees of freedom into the system? To answer these questions, various theoretical methods have been developed [19] - [22] . Among them, the nonequilibrium Green functions technique [23] - [25] provides us with powerful tools to calculate the current through the systems under consideration [26] - [28] . This approach allows us not only to obtain the steady-state current but also to explore the time evolution of the current after switching on/off external fields [29] - [31] . Moreover, combining the nonequilibrium Green",1,0
"In this work, we revisit some issues on netflow sample and export performance in terms of packet loss rate (PLR) and flow sampling accuracy (FSA). We first present an analytical model to study PLR under different traffic conditions with various sampling rates. Then, based on our analysis results, we propose a new method for estimating FSA by using only one parameter -the average number of flows per second. Finally, through extensive experiments conducted over both real-world traces and synthetic data sets, we show that our proposed estimation method is accurate enough to be used as a practical tool for evaluating network monitoring systems. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce related works about netflow sampling and exporting. In Section 3, we describe our experimental environment. In Section 4, we analyze the relationship between PLR and sampling rate. In Section 5, we estimate FSA according to the analysis result presented in Section 4. In Section 6, we evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed estimation method via extensive experiments. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 7.",1,0
"We report on the controlled collision between an individual trapped atom and a singly charged ion in a Paul trap, where both particles are confined to different regions of space separated by several micrometers. The ions can be moved along the axis connecting them with the atoms using electrostatic fields generated by electrodes outside the vacuum chamber. We demonstrate that this allows us to control the relative velocity at which they collide as well as their impact parameter. This opens up new possibilities for studying fundamental processes such as elastic scattering or charge exchange reactions. In addition we show how it is possible to use these techniques to prepare entanglement between two neutral atoms via a quantum gate operation mediated by one common ion. Quantum information processing requires scalable systems based on many qubits [1] . One promising approach towards realizing such devices relies on neutral atoms stored in optical lattices [2] , but suffers from limited coherence times due to spontaneous emission [3] . An alternative route involves storing atomic qubits in ensembles of trapped ions [4] . However, here too there exist severe limitations arising from decoherence caused by heating [5] . In order to overcome these difficulties, hybrid approaches have been proposed [6] combining advantages of both schemes [7, 8] . Here, the storage of quantum states takes place in a small number of highly coherent ions while large numbers of neutral atoms serve as flying qubits [9] . A crucial requirement for implementing such schemes is the ability to perform high-fidelity operations involving both types of qubit [10] . For example, it has recently been shown experimentally [11] that it is possible to entangle two neutral atoms via a shared ion [12] . To achieve this goal, however, the atoms need to interact with each other before being released into free flight [13] .",1,0
"We study the effect of electron-electron interactions (EEI) on the spin-flip rate due to phonons in semiconductor quantum dots. We show that EEI leads to an enhancement of this rate by several orders of magnitude, which is explained by the formation of collective excitations known as plasmons. The latter are responsible for the strong coupling between electrons and phonons leading to the observed increase in the spin-flip rate. Our results demonstrate that EEI can be used to control the spin dynamics in quantum dot systems.PACS numbers: 73.20.Dd, 74.78.Na, 78.67.HcThe ability to manipulate spins in semiconductors has attracted considerable attention over recent years because it could lead to novel applications such as spin-based transistors or logic devices [1] . In particular, semiconductor quantum dots have been proposed as promising candidates for these purposes [2] , since they allow one to confine charge carriers within small volumes with high precision [3] . In order to use quantum dots for spin manipulation, however, we need to understand how their spin states evolve under different conditions. This requires knowledge about the mechanisms governing spin relaxation processes [4] . One important mechanism is provided by phonons [5] : when confined charges move through the lattice potential of the crystal, they generate strain fields [6] . These strains induce local deformations of the lattice structure [7, 8] , resulting in the emission of phonons [9] . Since phonons carry angular momentum [10] , they may flip the spin state of the confined carrier [11] . However, the strength of this process depends strongly on the details of the confinement potential [12] . For example, if the confining potential is parabolic [13] , then the spin-flip rate induced by phonons scales linearly with temperature [14] . On the other hand, if the confining",1,0
"The mass spectrum and decay properties of the scalar mesons are studied by using the QCD sum rule method with the light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs). The masses, pole residues and coupling constants for the scalar mesons below 2 GeV are calculated systematically. In particular, we study the f0(1370), which is usually considered as an exotic state. We find that it can be naturally explained as a mixture of two conventional states, i.e., the lowest lying scalar glueball and the scalar quarkonium. Our results show that its mixing angle θ = −20° ± 5° , where the first error comes from the uncertainty of the LQCD data used to determine the parameters of LCDAs, while the second one arises from the uncertainties of the input parameters such as Borel parameter M2B and threshold s0B .I. INTRODUCTIO N In recent years, there has been great interest in studying the low energy hadronic physics due to both theoretical and experimental reasons [1] - [4] . On the theory side, lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) provides us with valuable information on the nonperturbative aspects of strong interactions [5] . However, at present most calculations have only focused on the ground-state hadrons [6] . On the other hand, the experimental observations of many new excited states beyond the naive quark model predictions [7] - [9] provide further motivation to explore their underlying structures [10] - [12] . For example, the newly observed scalars around 1.4-1.7 GeV [13] - [16] may contain important information about the nature of confinement [17] - [20] . It should also be noted that some of these newly discovered resonances cannot be easily accommodated into the traditional qq picture [21] - [23] . Therefore, it becomes necessary to investigate them more carefully [24] - [26] . In this work, we will use the QCD sum rules [27] - [29] to calculate the masses, pole residues and couplings of various scalar mesons below 2GeV systematically [30] . In particular, we focus our attention on the f 0 (1370), whose existence",1,0
"We present the results of our study on super star clusters (SSCs) in which we have found that SSCs can be divided into two categories, namely, those having a single mode and those having a double-mode solution for their density profiles. We show how these solutions are related to each other by using approximate analytic methods. The main aim is to understand why some SSCs appear as point sources while others do not. In this work, we also discuss the possibility of formation of such objects through mergers between smaller clusters or stars. Super massive star clusters (SMCs), known as young globular clusters (YGCs), open clusters (OCs), compact elliptical galaxies (CEGs), etc., are observed in many galactic systems ranging from dwarf irregular galaxies to giant ellipticals. These objects are believed to form during violent events like galaxy mergers, tidal interactions, and/or gas-rich major mergers. However, it has been shown recently that there exists another class of SMCs whose luminosity function shows a peak at intermediate masses (10^6-10^7 Msun). This type of cluster is referred to as 'Intermediate Massive Clusters'(IMCs; Portegies Zwart et al. (2010)). It appears that IMCs may represent a transition phase between open clusters and YGCs.",1,0
"The concept of molecular descriptors is central to the development of quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs). In this work, we introduce a new descriptor that can be used in QSAR studies as well as other applications where chemical reactivity or selectivity are important factors.The proposed descriptor is based on an extension of the concept of multipolarity developed by Mulliken. It has been shown previously that the multipole moments calculated using atomic orbital basis sets provide useful information about molecular properties such as polarizability, electronegativity, hardness, softness, etc.. We show here how these quantities may also be related to the electronic energy differences between different states of charge within a molecule. This relationship allows us to define a quantity called the 'multiphase index' which provides a measure of the relative stability of molecules with respect to changes in their oxidation state. The multiphase index was applied successfully to several test cases including the prediction of the oxidation potentials of some organic compounds.",1,0
"We present the results of an all-sky survey for galaxy clusters using data obtained with the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) by the Planck satellite, complemented at low redshifts by X-ray observations made with XMM-Newton and Chandra satellites. We use this sample to study the evolution of baryon content in massive halos over cosmic time. The total mass is estimated through gravitational lensing measurements performed on Hubble Space Telescope images. Our main findings are as follows:1. We find that the fraction of gas mass decreases strongly towards higher redshift.2. At z < 0.5 we measure fgas = Mgas/Mtot = 0.11 ± 0.01(stat.) ±0.02(sys.), where Mtot is the total gravitating mass within R500c, which corresponds to about half the virial radius. This value agrees well with previous estimates based on X-ray observations alone.3. For our full cluster sample spanning the range 0.1 < z < 1.3, we obtain fgas = 0.09 ± 0.01(±stat.).",1,0
"The mechanical properties of hair are determined by its molecular structure, which is mainly composed of proteins called keratins. The main structural unit in keratins is an alpha-helical coiled coil that forms microfibrils with other similar units to form intermediate filaments (IFs). These IFs then aggregate into bundles forming macrofibrils, which are further bundled together to form the basic building blocks of hair -the cortical cells-. In this work we have studied how the mechanical properties change as these structures evolve during the process known as maturation or ageing. We used confocal Raman spectroscopy to measure the changes in the secondary structure of individual keratin fibres extracted from human scalp hairs at different stages of their growth cycle. Our results show that the elastic modulus increases significantly when the fibre goes through the transformation from the alpha helix conformation to the beta-sheet one. This increase can be explained by the formation of hydrogen bonds between neighbouring strands of the protein backbone. Moreover, our measurements reveal that the presence of water molecules has a significant influence on the mechanical behaviour of the fibres.",1,0
"In this article, we provide an overview on the recent advances and challenges in energy-efficient resource allocation for wireless networks using game-theoretical approaches. We first introduce some basic concepts related to games and then present several representative works that have been done recently by researchers worldwide. Finally, we conclude with open research issues and future directions. In this article, we provide a survey on the recent advances and remaining challenges in energy-efficient radio resource management (RRM) for wireless networks using game theoretical approaches. The main goal is to show how these techniques can be used to improve network performance while reducing power consumption at each node. To achieve this objective, we first give a brief introduction about the concept of games as well as their applications in communication systems. Then, we review existing work on RRM problems formulated as non-cooperative or cooperative games. Finally, we discuss open research issues and possible future directions. This article is organized into four sections. Section II introduces some background information on games and their application in communications. Section III presents different types of games applied to solve RRM problems. Section IV discusses open research issues and concludes the article.",1,0
"Transcription factors (TFs) are proteins that bind specific sequences in the genome and regulate gene expression by recruiting other regulatory molecules or directly modulating RNA polymerase activity. The identification of TF binding sites is an important step towards understanding how genes are regulated, but it remains challenging due to their short length and degenerate sequence patterns. In this work we present a novel computational method for predicting TF binding sites based on a random walk model on a one-dimensional (1D) or two-dimensional (2D) lattice representing the DNA molecule. We show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods when applied to several datasets containing experimentally validated binding sites. Our results suggest that the proposed algorithm can be used as part of a pipeline for identifying putative binding sites in large genomic regions. Transcription factors (TFs), which include zinc finger proteins, homeodomain proteins, basic helix-loop-helix proteins, and others [1] , play key roles in regulating gene expression [2] . They bind specific sequences in the promoter region of target genes [3] and recruit other regulatory molecules such as coactivators [4] or corepressors [5] , or they may directly affect the rate at which RNA polymerases synthesize messenger RNAs [6] . The identification of TF binding sites has been shown to be useful for studying gene regulation [7, 8] . However, it remains difficult because these sites have very short lengths [9] and exhibit highly degenerate sequence patterns [10] . Several algorithms have been developed to predict TF binding sites [11] ; however, most existing approaches suffer from high false positive rates [12] . For example, the widely-used position weight matrix (PWM)-based motif finding algorithms [13] cannot accurately identify TF binding sites [14] . This problem arises mainly because PWM models assume independence between positions within motifs [15] , while real TF binding sites often contain dependencies among adjacent bases [16] . To address this issue, some researchers have attempted to incorporate higher-order interactions into PWMs [17] . Other studies have focused on developing probabilistic graphical models [18] , hidden Markov models [19] , support vector machines [20] , and neural networks [21] .",1,0
"The measurement is performed using the data collected by the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment during Run 2, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1 . The analysis uses events with one photon and two jets where both photons are reconstructed within the barrel calorimeter acceptance, |η| < 1.44. Events are selected requiring that each jet has transverse momentum pT > 30 GeV and pseudorapidity |η| < 4.7. A multivariate discriminant based on boosted decision trees is used for signal selection. The measured cross section as a function of the leading jet pT is compared to theoretical predictions obtained at next-to-leading order accuracy including resummation of soft gluons up to next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy. Good agreement between theory and measurements is observed over most of the kinematic range probed.Keywords: direct photon, dijet",1,0
"We present the first systematic survey of X-ray flares observed in gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows with the Swift satellite, which has been operating since 2004. We find that most GRBs show at least one X-ray flare during their prompt or early afterglow phase; we also find that some GRBs have multiple flaring episodes. The majority of these flares are soft, but there is evidence for both hard and very-hard flares as well. In addition to studying individual flares, we examine the spectral properties of all flares combined using time-resolved spectroscopy techniques. Our results indicate that the average spectrum can be described by an absorbed power law model with photon index Γ = 1.6 ± 0.1 and hydrogen column density NH = 2 × 10^22 cm^-2.Using this best-fit model, we calculate the total energy emitted in each flare over its duration. For the entire sample of flares studied here, we find that the mean fluence of the flares is10^-7 ergs/cm^2, while the mean peak luminosity is10^45 ergs/s. These values correspond to typical energies released in solar flares.",1,0
"We present the results obtained in digitizing and measuring astrometrically about 1000 photographic plates taken by the Carte du Ciel project at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional (OAN), San Pedro Mártir Observatory (SPMO) between 1950 and 1960. The OAN/SPMO is located on Mount Wilson, California, USA. We used a high resolution digital camera to scan these plates and then measured their positions relative to reference stars observed simultaneously on each plate. This allowed us to obtain accurate absolute proper motions for more than 100 000 stars down to V = 16 mag over an area of about 1 square degree centered around RA = 10 h 30 m , Dec = +60 deg . These data are available online through our web site  fuchs/CDCCatastro/Movies/movie1.html .

"We present results on INTEGRAL observations of the X-ray burster (XRB) KS 1741-293, which is located in the globular cluster NGC 6388 at a distance of about 12 kpc. The source was discovered by BeppoSAX and has been observed several times since then with different satellites. We report here on data obtained during an observation performed between February 24th and March 1st 2004 using the IBIS/ISGRI detector on-board INTEGRAL. During this time we detected two bursts from the source. In addition to these bursts, we found that there are significant variations in the hard Xray flux over short periods of time. These short-term variabilities can be explained as being due to rapid changes in the accretion rate onto the compact object or possibly due to precession of the neutron star's magnetic field axis. This work shows how important it is for future missions like XEUS and Constellation-X to have good timing capabilities in order to study such sources.",1,0
"We study the decoherence dynamics of an open quantum system consisting of two-level atoms coupled to a single-mode cavity field in presence of dissipation and driving fields. The atom-cavity coupling is treated within the framework of Jaynes-Cummings model, while the dissipative effects are described by using the master equation for the reduced density matrix of the system. We show that the steady state solution of this problem can be obtained analytically when the decay rates of all atomic levels are equal. In particular we find that the steady-state entanglement between the atom-field subsystem depends on both the strength of the external driving field as well as the number of excited states involved in the process. Finally, we discuss how our results could be used to explain recent experimental observations concerning the generation of nonclassical light via spontaneous emission processes.

"The electrostatic interactions between two asymmetrically charged membranes are studied by using the mean-field theory and Monte Carlo simulations. The results show that there is an attractive interaction between these membranes, which can be explained as follows. When one membrane approaches another with opposite charges on their surfaces, it will induce a dipole moment in its neighbor due to charge redistribution at the interface. This induced dipole moment causes an additional attraction between them. In addition, we find that this effect becomes more pronounced when the dielectric constant of water decreases. Finally, our study shows that the magnitude of the electrostatic force depends strongly on the surface charge density difference between the two membranes. We also discuss how the electrostatic forces affect the phase behavior of lipid bilayers. DOI: 10.1063/1.3189000 I. INTRODUCTIO N In recent years, many studies have been carried out on the properties of biomembranes [1] . It has been found that the physical characteristics of biological systems such as cell adhesion [2] , vesicle fusion [3] , protein folding [4] , etc., depend crucially on the structure and composition of the underlying lipid bilayer [5] . Biological membranes consist mainly of phospholipids [6] . These lipids contain hydrophobic tails and hydrophilic heads [7, 8] . Due to the amphiphilicity of phospholipids, they tend to self-assemble into bilayers [9] . A typical example for such a system is shown schematically in Fig.1(a) . Each layer consists of a monolayer of phospholipids arranged in a fluid-like state [10] . The thickness of each layer is about 5 nm [11] . The head groups point towards the aqueous solution while the tail groups face away from it [12] . Because of the presence of water molecules inside the layers, the effective dielectric constant of the medium is high (about 80) [13] . However, outside the layers, where only air exists, the dielectric constant is low (about 1). Therefore, the electric field lines penetrate easily through the interior region but not so much through the exterior region [14] .",1,0
"We report trigonometric parallax measurements for four high proper motion (HPM) white dwarfs with tangential velocities greater than 400 km/sec, and distances between 50 pc to 100 pc. The HPMs are all members of the Galactic halo population based on their kinematics. We find that three out of these four stars have masses less than 0.5 Msun which is consistent with theoretical predictions for white dwarfs in this mass range. However one star has an unexpectedly large mass of 1.1 Msun. This may be due to unresolved binarity or it could represent a new class of massive white dwarfs. These results will help us understand how the Galactic halo formed.Keywords: High Proper Motion Stars, White Dwarf, Parallax Measurement, Halo PopulationINTRODUCTIONIn recent years there has been considerable interest in studying the properties of high proper motion (HPM) white dwarfs because they can provide important information about the formation history of our Galaxy. For example, by measuring the space motions of individual objects we can determine whether they belong to the thin disk, thick disk, or halo populations. Furthermore, if we know the distance to each object then we can estimate its age using cooling models. Finally, accurate photometry combined with spectroscopy allows us to measure atmospheric parameters such as effective temperature, surface gravity, and chemical composition. All of these quantities together give us valuable insight into the evolution of the Milky Way.There are several ongoing surveys dedicated to finding HPM white dwarfs including the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS), SuperCOSMOS Sky Survey (SSS), Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), UK Schmidt Telescope Photometric H-Alpha Survey (UKSTPHAS), and Panoramic Survey TelescopeRapid Response System (Pan-STARRS). Most recently, the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey (CRTS) has discovered more than 1000 HPM white dwarves over the past decade. Many of them were found serendipitously during searches",1,0
"We present an update on our previous work (Jarosik et al., 2006) where we used Bayesian methods to analyze the polarization data obtained by Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). We use the same likelihood function as in Jarosik et al. (2006), but now include also information about the noise covariance matrix and its uncertainty, which was not available at that time. The main goal is to test whether the observed large-scale temperature-polarization correlation can be explained within the standard cosmological model with adiabatic initial conditions and Gaussian primordial fluctuations or it requires some additional physics beyond this simple picture. In particular, we are interested in testing predictions made recently by several authors who suggested that such correlations could arise due to gravitational lensing effects induced by large scale structure along the line-of-sight. Our results show no significant evidence for any deviations from the simplest theoretical models considered here.",1,0
"We present the first results on Spitzer infrared spectroscopy (IRS) observations of four Galactic supernova remnants, G11.2−0.3, Kes 17, RCW 103, and W44. The main goal is to study their physical conditions in detail by analyzing the observed emission lines with non-LTE radiative transfer models. We find that all these objects are dominated by dense molecular gas at temperatures between 100 K and 300 K. In addition we detect atomic hydrogen emission lines which indicate the presence of hotter plasma components. For two sources, Kes 17 and W44, we also observe strong [O III] emission indicating shock-heated ionized gas. Finally, for one source, Kes 17, we identify an additional cold dust component at T = 20 K. This work demonstrates the power of mid-infrared spectroscopy as a tool to investigate the physics of supernova remnants. It will be followed up by detailed studies of individual targets using more sophisticated modeling techniques.Keywords: Supernova Remnant, Mid-Infrared Spectroscopy",1,0
"We prove that the set of all polynomials in one variable with integer coefficients is uniquely representable as a sum of squares of rational functions, and we give an explicit algorithm for computing such representation.We also show how to extend this result to multivariate polynomials over finite fields. The problem of representing a given polynomial as a sum of squares (SOS) has been studied extensively since Hilbert's 19th century work on quadratic forms. In particular, it was shown by Artin that every nonnegative integer can be represented as a sum of four squares of integers; see [1] . This theorem implies that any positive integer n can be written as a sum of at most 4 square roots of integers. However, there are infinitely many ways to write each number as a sum of two or three square roots of integers. For example, 1 = 2 + √ 3 , but also 1 = 2 − √ 3 . The uniqueness question becomes more interesting when restricted to certain classes of polynomials. It turns out that if f ∈ Z[x] is a monic polynomial whose Galois group G(f ) is solvable then f is uniquely representable as SOS [2] . On the other hand, if G(f ) contains a nonsolvable subgroup then f may have several distinct SOS representations [3] .",1,0
"We present the results of numerical simulations aimed at studying the formation and evolution of off-center ionized hydrogen (HII) regions around massive stars embedded in an isothermal, self-gravitating gas distribution with a power-law density profile.We find that the expansion velocity of the ionization front decreases as it moves away from the star's position towards larger radii. The decrease occurs because the pressure gradient becomes smaller when moving outward due to the decreasing density. As a result, the ionization front may become unstable against small perturbations which lead to its fragmentation into several blobs or fingers. These blobs are surrounded by dense shells of neutral material produced by photo-evaporation of the surrounding medium. In addition, we show that the mass loss rate increases significantly for large values of the index n of the power law density distribution. This increase can be explained by the fact that the gravitational force per unit volume acting on the shell decreases faster than the ram pressure of the expanding bubble.",1,0
