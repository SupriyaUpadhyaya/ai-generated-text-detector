Our motivation stems from the need to better understand the role of dust extinction in shaping the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of AGN, particularly within the obscuring torus. By analyzing the [Ne II] 12.8 μm and [Ne III] 15.6 μm line ratios, we find evidence for significant extinction by the torus in many objects. These results suggest that the gas density and temperature conditions inferred from these lines are consistent with a model where the torus is composed of a warm and dense medium, likely associated with a mixture of molecular clouds and dusty wind-blown bubbles. Furthermore, we observe variations in line ratios between different spectral features, indicating heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of gas within individual AGN systems. "}

{"machine_text": "We develop a local approximation approach to study superconductivity in a magnetic field, focusing on the problem of understanding how an external magnetic field affects the superconducting state. The key idea is to utilize a self-consistent mean-field theory, where we approximate the single-particle Green's function within a small spatial region around each point in momentum space. This local approximation allows us to treat the effects of impurities and the magnetic field on a qualitative level, while still retaining the essential features of superconductivity.

{"machine_text": "We investigate the possibility of generating dark matter in gauge mediation frameworks from emergent supersymmetry. Motivated by the need to reconcile the minimal supersymmetric standard model with observations, we consider scenarios where supersymmetry is not a fundamental aspect but rather arises from an underlying non-supersymmetric theory. By implementing this approach within a specific class of gauge mediation models, we demonstrate how the gravitino can acquire a mass through radiative corrections, while the lighter superpartner spectrum remains largely unchanged. This emergent supersymmetry paradigm allows us to sidestep traditional constraints on supersymmetric dark matter candidates and explore novel possibilities for addressing the observed relic density.

Specifically, we aim to resolve the tension between the slow-roll approximation, which underlies most existing models, and the observational constraints on the perturbations of the primordial power spectrum. Our approach involves a novel combination of topological considerations and higher-dimensional geometric insights, which enable us to construct an explicit effective potential for the inflaton field.
