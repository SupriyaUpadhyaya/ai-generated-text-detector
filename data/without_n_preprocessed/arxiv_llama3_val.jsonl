The reinvestigation concerns the possibility of a phase transition from the original Hermitian and $PT$ symmetric phase to a non-Hermitian and $PT$ symmetric one. This kind of phase transition, if verified experimentally, will lead to the first proof that non-Hermitian and $PT$ symmetric models are not just a mathematical research framework but are a nature desire. To do the investigation, we calculated the effective potential up to second order in the couplings and found a Hermitian to Non-Hermitian phase transition. This leads us to introduce, for the first time, hermiticity as a symmetry which can be broken due to quantum corrections, \\textit{i.e.}, when starting with a model which is Hermitian in the classical level, quantum corrections can break hermiticity while the theory stays physically acceptable. In fact, ignoring this phase will lead to violation of universality when comparing this model predictions with other models in the same class of universality. For instance, in a previous work we obtained a second order phase transition for the $PT$ symmetric and non-Hermitian $(-g\\phi^{4})$ and according to universality, this phase should exist in the phase structure of the ($g\\phi^{4}+h\\phi^{6}$) model for negative $g$. Finally, among the novelties in this letter, in our calculation for the effective potential, we introduced a new renormalization group equation which describes the invariance of the bare vacuum energy under the change of the scale. We showed that without this invariance, the original theory and the effective one are inequivalent.

Leaving aside the debate about the processes that would lead to the formation of a gravastar and the astronomical evidence in their support, we here address two basic questions: Is a gravastar stable against generic perturbations? If stable, can an observer distinguish it from a black hole of the same mass? To answer these questions we construct a general class of gravastars and determine the conditions they must satisfy in order to exist as equilibrium solutions of the Einstein equations. For such models we perform a systematic stability analysis against axial-perturbations, computing the real and imaginary parts of the eigenfrequencies. Overall, we find that gravastars are stable to axial perturbations, but also that their quasi-normal modes differ from those of a black hole of the same mass and thus can be used to discern, beyond dispute, a gravastar from a black hole.

Using a recently developed formalism for localized perturbations to an ultra-relativistic shock, we derive constraints on the lengthscale, amplitude, and volume filling factor of density clumps required to produce a given magnetic energy fraction within the expansion time of the shock, assuming that the energy in the field achieves equipartion with the turbulence. Stronger and smaller-scale inhomogeneities are required for larger shock Lorentz factors. Hence it is likely that the magnetic energy fraction evolves as the shock slows.

Linear tabling is a framework from which different methods can be derived based on the strategies used in handling looping subgoals. One decision concerns when answers are consumed and returned. This paper describes two strategies, namely, {\\it lazy} and {\\it eager} strategies, and compares them both qualitatively and quantitatively. The results indicate that, while the lazy strategy has good locality and is well suited for finding all solutions, the eager strategy is comparable in speed with the lazy strategy and is well suited for programs with cuts. Linear tabling relies on depth-first iterative deepening rather than suspension to compute fixpoints. Each cluster of inter-dependent subgoals as represented by a top-most looping subgoal is iteratively evaluated until no subgoal in it can produce any new answers. Naive re-evaluation of all looping subgoals, albeit simple, may be computationally unacceptable.

Because of this regularity problem it has become common practice to use full-blown Cartesian three-dimensional codes to simulate axi-symmetric systems. In this work we follow a recent idea idea of Rinne and Stewart and present a simple procedure to regularize the equations both in spherical and axi-symmetric spaces.

On the other hand, as the bandwidth ratio b (channel uses per source symbol) tends to zero, the power distribution that minimizes expected distortion converges to the power distribution that maximizes expected capacity. While expected distortion can be improved by acquiring CSI at the transmitter (CSIT) or by increasing diversity from the realization of independent fading paths, at high SNR the performance benefit from diversity exceeds that from CSIT, especially when b is large.

In particular, for micro-systems, it allows the production of devices with feature sizes down to few tens of microns. An important parameter of this process is the surface roughness of post-blasted surfaces. In this work the scaling properties of Pyrex glass and silicon surfaces after bombardment with alumina particles is investigated. The targets were bombarded at normal incidence using alumina particles with two different average sizes, $29\\mu m$ and $9\\mu m$, respectively. This investigation indicates that the resulting surfaces have multifractal properties. Applying multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA) allowed us to determine the singularity spectrum of the surfaces. This spectrum did not depend on the target material or on the size of the particles. Several parameters quantifying relevant quantities were determined. We argue that for scales below $5 \\mu m$, fracture processes are dominant while at large scales long range correlations are responsible for the multifractal behaviour.

The meteors, at about 100km altitude, and artificial satellites/debris in orbit, at 500km altitude or higher, were clearly discriminated by their apparent defocused image sizes. CCD photometry of the 13 meteors, including 1 Perseid, 1 Aquarid, and 11 sporadic meteors, was performed. We defined a peak video-rate magnitude by comparing the integrated photon counts from the brightest portion of the track traversed within 33ms to those from a 0-mag star during the same time duration. This definition gives magnitudes in the range 4.0< V_{vr} <6.4 and 4.1< I_{vr}<5.9 for these 13 meteors. The corresponding magnitude for virtual naked-eye observers could be somewhat fainter especially for the V-band observation, in which the [OI] 5577 line lasting about 1 sec as an afterglow could contribute to the integrated flux of the present 5-10 min CCD exposures. Although the spatial resolution is insufficient to resolve the source size of anything smaller than about 1 m, we developed a new estimate of the collisionally excited column diameter of these meteors. A diameter as small as a few mm was derived from their collisionally excited photon rates, meteor speed, and the volume density of the oxygen atoms at the 100km altitude. The actual column diameter of the radiating zone, however, could be as large as few 100m because the excited atoms travel that distance before they emit forbidden lines in 0.7 sec of its average lifetime. Among the 44 artificial space objects, we confirmed that 17 were cataloged satellites/space debris.

In the framework of the flux rope catastrophe model for CMEs, the energy may be abruptly released either by an ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) catastrophe, which belongs to a global magnetic topological instability of the system, or by a fast magnetic reconnection across preexisting or rapidly-developing electric current sheets. Both ways of magnetic energy release are thought to be important to CME dynamics. To disentangle their contributions, we construct a flux rope catastrophe model in the corona and solar wind and compare different cases in which we either prohibit or allow magnetic reconnection to take place across rapidly-growing current sheets during the eruption. It is demonstrated that CMEs, even fast ones, can be produced taking the ideal MHD catastrophe as the only process of magnetic energy release. Nevertheless, the eruptive speed can be significantly enhanced after magnetic reconnection sets in. In addition, a smooth transition from slow to fast eruptions is observed when increasing the strength of the background magnetic field, simply because in a stronger field there is more free magnetic energy at the catastrophic point available to be released during an eruption. This suggests that fast and slow CMEs may have an identical driving mechanism.

A moment's reflection leads to increasing doubts that such an approach should work as the transition is nonmagnetic, voiding the relevance of spin density modes. Charge density modes are irrelevelant since the long range Coulomb interaction leads to a large plasmon gap and their incompressibility. In solidarity with these doubts, recent measurements of the Mott critical point in low dimensional organic materials yield critical exponents in violent diasagreement with the bosonic mode criticality lore. We propose that fermionic fluctuations control the behavior of the Mott transition. The transition thus has an intrinsic quantum aspect despite being a finite temperature phase transition. We develop this hitherto unexplored physics, obtain experimental predictions and find agreement with one of the novel unexplained experimental exponents. We conclude that this Mott transition corresponds to a new universality class of finite temperature critical points that contains quantum effects and cannot be accounted for by conventional Ginzburg-Landau-Wilson wisdom.

Furthermore, we observe a crossover from a Gaussian to a non-Gaussian critical behavior as the system approaches the quantum critical point. Our findings demonstrate that the GLW theory is insufficient to describe the critical behavior of Mott fermionic systems, and that a more nuanced understanding of the critical phenomena is necessary.

Archival INTEGRAL data and RXTE observations showed that the outbursts occur with a periodicity of ~330 days. Thus, IGR J11215-5952 is the first SFXT displaying periodic outbursts, possibly related to the orbital period. We performed a Target of Opportunity observation with Swift with the main aim of monitoring the source behaviour around the time of the fifth outburst, expected on 2007 Feb 9. The source field was observed with Swift twice a day (2ks/day) starting from 4th February, 2007, until the fifth outburst, and then for ~5 ks a day afterwards, during a monitoring campaign that lasted 23 days for a total on-source exposure of ~73 ks. This is the most complete monitoring campaign of an outburst from a SFXT. The spectrum during the brightest flares is well described by an absorbed power law with a photon index of 1 and N_H~1 10^22 cm^-2. A 1-10 keV peak luminosity of ~10^36 erg s^-1 was derived (assuming 6.2 kpc, the distance of the optical counterpart). These Swift observations are a unique data-set for an outburst of a SFXT, thanks to the combination of sensitivity and time coverage, and they allowed a study of IGR J11215-5952 from outburst onset to almost quiescence. We find that the accretion phase lasts longer than previously thought on the basis of lower sensitivity instruments observing only the brightest flares. The observed phenomenology is consistent with a smoothly increasing flux triggered at the periastron passage in a wide eccentric orbit with many flares superimposed, possibly due to episodic or inhomogeneous accretion.

Halos evolve through a series of quiescent phases of a slow accretion intermitted by violent events of major mergers. In the quiescent phases the density of the halo closely follows the NFW profile and the phase-space density profile, Q(r), is given by the Taylor & Navarro power law, r^{-beta}, where beta ~ 1.9 and stays remarkably stable over the Hubble time. Expressing the phase-space density by the NFW parameters, Q(r)=Qs (r/Rs)^{-beta}, the evolution of Q is determined by Qs. We have found that the effective mass surface density within Rs, Sigma_s = rhos Rs, remains constant throughout the evolution of a given DM halo along the main branch of its merging tree. This invariance entails that Qs ~ Rs^{-5/2} and Q(r) ~ Sigma_s^{-1/2} Rs^{-5/2} (r/ Rs)^{-beta}. It follows that the phase-space density remains constant, in the sense of Qs=const., in the quiescent phases and it decreases as Rs^{-5/2} in the violent ones. The physical origin of the NFW density profile and the phase-space density power law is still unknown. Yet, the numerical experiments show that halos recover these relations after the violent phases. The major mergers drive Rs to increase and Qs to decrease discontinuously while keeping Qs Rs^{5/2} = const. The virial equilibrium in the quiescent phases implies that a DM halos evolves along a sequence of NFW profiles with constant energy per unit volume (i.e., pressure) within Rs.

We carried out a systematic spectroscopic campaign for the observation of all unidentified objects of the sample using the ESO 3.6m, the KPNO 4m, and the TNG optical telescopes. We present new identifications and optical spectra for 76 sources, 50 of which are new BL Lac objects, 18 are sources previously referred as BL Lacs but for which no redshift information was available, and 8 are broad emission lines AGNs. We find that the multi-frequency selection technique used to build the survey is highly efficient (about 90%) in selecting BL Lacs objects. We present positional and spectroscopic information for all confirmed BL Lac objects. Our data allowed us to determined 36 redshifts out of the 50 new BL Lacs and 5 new redshifts for the previously known objects. The redshift distribution of the complete sample is presented and compared with that of other BL Lacs samples. For 26 sources without recognizable absorption features, we calculated lower limits to the redshift using a method based on simulated optical spectra with different ratios between jet and galaxy emission. For a subsample of 38 object with high-quality spectra, we find a correlation between the optical spectral slope, the 1.4 GHz radio luminosity, and the Ca H&K break value, indicating that for powerful/beamed sources the optical light is dominated by the non-thermal emission from the jet.

Distance measurements are mandatory to kinematically segregate halo object from disk objects and hence enable a more reliable estimate of the local density of halo dark matter residing in such objects.   We present trigonometric parallax measurements for 15 candidate halo white dwarfs (WDs) selected from the Oppenheimer et al. (2001) list. We observed the stars using the ESO 1.56-m Danish Telescope and ESO 2.2-m telescope from August 2001 to July 2004. Parallaxes with accuracies of 1--2 mas were determined yielding relative errors on distances of $\\sim5$% for 6 objects, $\\sim12$% for 3 objects, and $\\sim20$% for two more objects. Four stars appear to be too distant (probably farther than 100 pc) to have measurable parallaxes in our observations. Distances, absolute magnitudes and revised space velocities were derived for the 15 halo WDs from the Oppenheimer et al. (2001) list. Halo membership is confirmed unambiguously for 6 objects while 5 objects may be thick disk members and 4 objects are too distant to draw any conclusion based solely on kinematics. Comparing our trigonometric parallaxes with photometric parallaxes used in previous work reveals an overestimation of distance as derived from photometric techniques.

The governing Eulerian equations are solved using pseudo-spectral methods on up to 512**3 computional grid points. DNS results for particle concentration and enstrophy at Taylor microscale Reynolds numbers in the range 34 - 170 were used to directly determine multiplier distributions (PDFs) on spatial scales 3 times the Kolmogorov length scale. The width of the PDFs, which is a measure of intermittency, decreases with increasing mass loading within the local region where the multipliers are measured. The functional form of this dependence is not sensitive to Reynolds numbers in the range considered. A partition correlation probability is included in the cascade model to account for the observed spatial anticorrelation between particle concentration and enstrophy. Joint probability distribution functions of concentration and enstrophy generated using the cascade model are shown to be in excellent agreement with those derived directly from our 3D simulations. Probabilities predicted by the cascade model are presented at Reynolds numbers well beyond what is achievable by direct simulation. These results clearly indicate that particle mass loading significantly reduces the probabilities of high particle concentration and enstrophy relative to those resulting from unloaded runs. Particle mass density appears to reach a limit at around 100 times the gas density. This approach has promise for significant computational savings in certain applications.

It is assumed that the collapsing speeds of the two fluids are very large. We explore this condition by using the high-speed approximation scheme. There arise two cases, i.e., bounded and vanishing of the ratios of the pressures with densities of two fluids given by $c_s, d_s$. It is shown that the high-speed approximation scheme breaks down by non-zero pressures $p_1, p_2$ when $c_s, d_s$ are bounded below by some positive constants. The failure of the high-speed approximation scheme at some particular time of the gravitational collapse suggests the uncertainity on the evolution at and after this time. In the bounded case, the naked singularity formation seems to be impossible for the cylindrical two perfect fluids. For the vanishing case, if a linear equation of state is used, the high-speed collapse does not break down by the effects of the pressures and consequently a naked singularity forms.

This step is very important for GLAST-LAT and EGRET image analysis since PSF varies more than one order of magnitude from one gamma ray to another depending on its energy as well as its impact point and angle in the instrument.

We confirm our previous results obtained from the study of Ap and Bp stars with accurate measurements of the mean magnetic field modulus and mean quadratic magnetic fields that magnetic stars of mass M < 3 M_sun are concentrated towards the centre of the main-sequence band. In contrast, stars with masses M > 3 M_sun seem to be concentrated closer to the ZAMS. The study of a few known members of nearby open clusters with accurate Hipparcos parallaxes confirms these conclusions. Stronger magnetic fields tend to be found in hotter, younger and more massive stars, as well as in stars with shorter rotation periods. No evidence is found for any loss of angular momentum during the main-sequence life. The magnetic flux remains constant over the stellar life time on the main sequence. An excess of stars with large obliquities beta is detected in both higher and lower mass stars. The obliquity angle distribution as inferred from the distribution of r-values appears random at the time magnetic stars become observable on the H-R diagram. After quite a short time spent on the main sequence, the obliquity angle beta tends to reach values close to either 90 deg or 0 deg for M < 3 M_sun. The evolution of the obliquity angle beta seems to be somewhat different for low and high mass stars. While we find a strong hint for an increase of beta with the elapsed time on the main sequence for stars with M > 3 M_sun, no similar trend is found for stars with M < 3 M_sun.

As a consequence,the electrons exhibit a unique type of Hamiltonian chaos, which creates an intricate mesh of conduction channels (a stochastic web) in phase space, leading to a large resonant increase in the current flow at critical values of the applied voltage. This phase-space patterning provides a sensitive mechanism for controlling electrical resistance. In this paper, we investigate the effects of dissipation on the electron dynamics by modifying the semiclassical equations of motion to include a linear damping term. We demonstrate that even in the presence of dissipation,deterministic chaos plays an important role in the electron transport process. We identify mechanisms for the onset of chaos and explore the associated sequence of bifurcations in the electron trajectories. When the Bloch and cyclotron frequencies are commensurate, complex multistability phenomena occur in the system. In particular, for fixed values of the control parameters several distinct stable regimes can coexist, each corresponding to different initial conditions. We show that this multistability has clear, experimentally-observable, signatures in the electron transport characteristics.

For n<=20 we provide simple analytic fitting formulae to describe the non-resonant part of the two-photon emission profiles. Combining these with the analytic form of the cascade-term yields a simple and accurate description of the full two-photon decay spectrum, which only involves a sum over a few intermediate states. We demonstrate that the cascade term naturally leads to a nearly Lorentzian shape of the two-photon profiles in the vicinity of the resonances. However, due to quantum-electrodynamical corrections, the two-photon emission spectra deviate significantly from the Lorentzian shape in the very distant wings of the resonances. We investigate up to which distance the two-photon profiles are close to a Lorentzian and discuss the role of the interference term. We then analyze how the deviation of the two-photon profiles from the Lorentzian shape affects the dynamics of cosmological hydrogen recombination. Since in this context the escape of photons from the Lyman-alpha resonance plays a crucial role, we concentrate on the two-photon corrections in the vicinity of the Lyman-alpha line. Our computations show that the changes in the ionization history due to the additional two-photon process from high shell (n>2) likely do not reach the percent-level.

That implies corresponding changes in the admissible commutation relations. The introduction of the concept of the vacuum makes narrow the class of the possible commutation relations; in particular, the mentioned redefinition of the dynamical variables is reduced to normal ordering. As a last restriction on that class is imposed the requirement for existing of an effective procedure for calculating vacuum mean values.

In this article we obtain the scalar flexure equations governing the deformations of a thin spherical shell with variable thickness or variable Young's modulus. The resulting equations can be solved in succession, except for a system of two simultaneous equations, the solutions of which are the transverse deflection and an associated stress function. In order to include bottom loading generated by mantle convection, we extend the method of stress functions to include loads with a toroidal tangential component. We further show that toroidal tangential displacement always occurs if the shell thickness varies, even in the absence of toroidal loads. We finally prove that the degree-one harmonic components of the transverse deflection and of the toroidal tangential displacement are independent of the elastic properties of the shell and are associated with translational and rotational freedom. The flexure equations for a shell of variable thickness are useful not only for the prediction of the gravity signal in local admittance studies, but also for the construction of stress maps in tectonic analysis.

The complicated phase structure of the model is studied thoroughly using numerical tools and analytical arguments. In the three-dimensional space of coupling parameters we identify the Fermi liquid, the spin gap, the superconductor and the strange metallic phases. The behavior of three kinds of topological defects -- holon and spinon vortices and monopoles - is explored in various phases. We also observe a new effect, the strong enhancement of the phase transition strength reflected in a lower order of the transition: at sufficiently strong gauge coupling the two second order phase transitions -- corresponding to spinon-pair and holon condensation lines - join partially in the phase diagram and become a first order phase transition in that region. The last observation may have an analogue in Quantum Chromodynamics at non-zero temperature and finite baryon density. We argue that at sufficiently large baryon density the finite-temperature transition between the (3-flavor paired) color superconducting phase and the quark-gluon plasma phases should be much stronger compared with the transition between 2-flavor paired and 3-flavor paired superconducting phases.

The precision of this technique is currently limited by interferometric measurements at the 1.5% level. At this level, the center-to-limb darkening (CLD) and the presence of circumstellar envelopes (CSE) seem to be the two main sources of bias. The observations we performed aim at improving our knowledge of the interferometric visibility profile of Cepheids. In particular, we assess the systematic presence of CSE around Cepheids in order determine accurate distances with the IBWM free from CSE biased angular diameters. We observed a Cepheid (Y Oph) for which the pulsation is well resolved and a non-pulsating yellow supergiant (alpha Per) using long-baseline near-infrared interferometry. We interpreted these data using a simple CSE model we previously developed. We found that our observations of alpha Per do not provide evidence for a CSE. The measured CLD is explained by an hydrostatic photospheric model. Our observations of Y Oph, when compared to smaller baseline measurements, suggest that it is surrounded by a CSE with similar characteristics to CSE found previously around other Cepheids. We have determined the distance to Y Oph to be d=491+/-18 pc. Additional evidence points toward the conclusion that most Cepheids are surrounded by faint CSE, detected by near infrared interferometry: after observing four Cepheids, all show evidence for a CSE. Our CSE non-detection around a non-pulsating supergiant in the instability strip, alpha Per, provides confidence in the detection technique and suggests a pulsation driven mass-loss mechanism for the Cepheids.

The slow-wave coefficients for azimunthally symmetric guided waves increase with the number of metallic CNTs in the bundle, tending for thick bundles to unity, which is characteristic of macroscopic metallic wires. The existence of an azimuthally nonsymmetric guided wave at low frequencies in a bundle of a large number of finite-length CNTs stands in contrast to the characteristics of guided-wave propagation in a single CNT. The equivalent-multishell approach yields the polarizability scalar and the antenna efficiency of a bundle of finite-length CNTs in the long-wavelength regime over a wide frequency range spanning the terahertz and the near-infrared regimes. Edge effects give rise to geometric resonances in such bundles.

Many authors have therefore considered gene duplication as a driving force in shaping the topology of molecular networks. In particular it has been noted that growth via duplication would act as an implicit way of preferential attachment, and thereby provide the observed broad degree distributions of molecular networks.   Results: We extend current models of gene duplication and rewiring by including directions and the fact that molecular networks are not a result of unidirectional growth. We introduce upstream sites and downstream shapes to quantify potential links during duplication and rewiring. We find that this in itself generates the observed scaling of transcription factors for genome sites in procaryotes. The dynamical model can generate a scale-free degree distribution, p(k)&prop; 1/k^&gamma;, with exponent &gamma;=1 in the non-growing case, and with &gamma;>1 when the network is growing.   Conclusions: We find that duplication of genes followed by substantial recombination of upstream regions could generate main features of genetic regulatory networks. Our steady state degree distribution is however to broad to be consistent with data, thereby suggesting that selective pruning acts as a main additional constraint on duplicated genes.

This system admits three constants of the motion in absence of radiation reaction: energy, angular momentum, and a third constant analogous to the Carter constant. We compute instantaneous and time-averaged rates of change of these three constants. For a point particle orbiting a black hole, Ryan has computed the leading order evolution of the orbit's Carter constant, which is linear in the spin. Our result, when combined with an interaction quadratic in the spin (the coupling of the black hole's spin to its own radiation reaction field), gives the next to leading order evolution. The effect of the quadrupole, like that of the linear spin term, is to circularize eccentric orbits and to drive the orbital plane towards antialignment with the symmetry axis. In addition we consider a system of two point masses where one body has a single mass multipole or current multipole. To linear order in the mass ratio, to linear order in the multipole, and to the leading post-Newtonian order, we show that there does not exist an analog of the Carter constant for such a system (except for the cases of spin and mass quadrupole).

We point out that the black-hole masses at the formation decrease with the initial field strength, on the other hand, increase with the initial rotation rates. As for the neutrino properties, we point out that the degree of the differential rotation plays an important role to determine which species of the neutrino luminosity is more dominant than the others. Furthermore, we find that the stronger magnetic fields make the peak neutrino luminosities smaller, because the magnetic pressure acts to halt the collapse in the central regions, leading to the suppression of the releasable gravitational binding energies.

Using an extremely simplified merger tree model, we show that, even in the limit of very large ejection probability, after a small number of merger generations there should still be an appreciable fraction (>50%) of galaxies with supermassive black holes today. We go on to argue that the inclusion of more realistic physics ingredients in the merger model should systematically increase this retention fraction, helping to resolve a potential conflict between theory and observation.

We find that in Cu4(OD)6Cl2, where distorted kagome planes are weakly coupled to each other, a dispersionless excitation mode appears in the magnetic excitation spectrum below ~ 20 K, whose characteristics resemble those of quantum spin singlets in a solid state, known as a valence bond solid (VBS), that breaks translational symmetry. Doping nonmagnetic Zn2+ ions reduces the distortion of the kagome lattice, and weakens the interplane coupling but also dilutes the magnetic occupancy of the kagome lattice.

This stands in sharp contrast to the one AGN with L_{X,H} > 10^43 erg/s we discovered in our earlier study of eight low-redshift clusters with z=0.06-0.31 (average z~0.2).

Measurements of cosmic ray antiparticles, such as positrons, can impose strong constraints on the nature of new physics beyond the Standard Model. However, cosmic ray positron measurements are experimentally very challenging due to the vast proton background. A novel approach of positron identification with the space-borne AMS-01 experiment, namely through the detection of bremsstrahlung conversion in a silicon microstrip detector, is introduced. Bremsstrahlung from protons is suppressed by a factor of more than 3*10^6 with respect to positrons. The results of the positron measurement show that the bremsstrahlung approach extends the sensitivity range of AMS-01 to positron momenta up to 50 GeV/c, which is far beyond the original scope of the experiment. At momenta above 8 GeV/c there is indication for a positron overabundance with respect to model predictions for purely secondary positron production. Therefore, the AMS-01 data lend further weight to the hints of a positron overabundance seen in the data from earlier experiments.

Our analysis reveals that the anomalous H_2CO absorption is spatially correlated with the densest regions of CO emission, suggesting that the H_2CO is formed in the densest gas. The line profiles of both species show evidence of turbulent motion and velocity gradients, which are likely driven by the strong stellar winds and outflows in the region.

Conversely, sugars seem to increase significantly the relaxation times of the protein. These effects are shown to be correlated to the fractional solvent accessibilities of lysozyme residues and further support the slaving of protein dynamics. Moreover, a significant increase in the relaxation times of lysozyme, sugars and water molecules is observed within the studied concentration range and may result from the percolation of the hydrogen-bond network of sugar molecules.

We find that the outflows tend to escape to low density regions, and hardly affect the dense filaments visible in HI absorption. As a result, the strength of HI absorption near galaxies is not reduced by galactic winds, but even slightly increases. We also find that a lack of HI absorption for lines of sight (LOS) close to galaxies, as found by Adelberger et al., can be created by hot gas around the galaxies induced by accretion shock heating. In contrast to HI, metal absorption systems are sensitive to the presence of winds. The models without feedback can produce the strong CIV and OVI absorption lines in LOS within 50 kpc from galaxies, while strong SN feedback is capable of creating strong CIV and OVI lines out to about twice that distance. We also analyze the mean transmissivity of HI, CIV, and OVI within 1 h$^{-1}$ Mpc from star-forming galaxies. The probability distribution of the transmissivity of HI is independent of the strength of SN feedback, but strong feedback produces LOS with lower transmissivity of metal lines.

In this paper we present the discovery of the first four CFHQS quasars at redshift greater than 6, including the most distant known quasar, CFHQS J2329-0301 at z=6.43. We describe the observational method used to identify the quasars and present optical, infrared, and millimeter photometry and optical and near-infrared spectroscopy. We investigate the dust properties of these quasars finding an unusual dust extinction curve for one quasar and a high far-infrared luminosity due to dust emission for another. The mean millimeter continuum flux for CFHQS quasars is substantially lower than that for SDSS quasars at the same redshift, likely due to a correlation with quasar UV luminosity. For two quasars with sufficiently high signal-to-noise optical spectra, we use the spectra to investigate the ionization state of hydrogen at z>5. For CFHQS J1509-1749 at z=6.12, we find significant evolution (beyond a simple extrapolation of lower redshift data) in the Gunn-Peterson optical depth at z>5.4. The line-of-sight to this quasar has one of the highest known optical depths at z~5.8. An analysis of the sizes of the highly-ionized near-zones in the spectra of two quasars at z=6.12 and z=6.43 suggest the IGM surrounding these quasars was substantially ionized before these quasars turned on. Together, these observations point towards an extended reionization process, but we caution that cosmic variance is still a major limitation in z>6 quasar observations.

Our model spectra fit the observed spectra well, successfully reproducing most of the features, including the prominent He I absorptions.

High-metallicity models fit well at early epochs, but not as well as solar-metallicity models after maximum light.

Thus this is an ideal method to solve the initial data/constraint equations in General Relativity for (for instance) black hole interactions, or for other strong-field gravitational configurations. Recent efforts have produced finite difference multigrid solvers for domains with holes (excised regions). We present here the extension of these concepts to higher order (fourth-, sixth- and eigth-order). The high order convergence allows rapid solution on relatively small computational grids. Also, general relativity evolution codes are moving to typically fourth-order; data have to be computed at least as accurately as this same order for straightfoward demonstration of the proper order of convergence in the evolution.   Our vertex-centered multigrid code demonstrates globally high-order-accurate solutions of elliptic equations over domains containing holes, in two spatial dimensions with fixed (Dirichlet) outer boundary conditions, and in three spatial dimensions with {\\it Robin} outer boundary conditions. We demonstrate a ``real world'' 3-dimensional problem which is the solution of the conformally flat Hamiltonian constraint of General Relativity. The success of this method depends on: a) the choice of the discretization near the holes; b) the definition of the location of the inner boundary, which allows resolution of the hole even on the coarsest grids; and on maintaining the same order of convergence at the boundaries as in the interior of the computational domain.

Earlier studies considered a line density-distribution of electrons instead. We focus our attention on the long-wavelength asymptote (compared with resonance wavelength), at large distance of the electron bunch from the undulator entrance compared to the overtaking length, and for large vacuum-chamber size compared to the typical transverse size of the field. These restrictions define a parameter region of interest for practical applications. We calculate a closed expression for impedance and wake function that may be evaluated numerically in the most general case. Such expression allows us to derive an analytical solution for a Gaussian transverse and longitudinal bunch shape. Finally, we study the feasibility of current-enhanced SASE schemes (ESASE) recently proposed for LCLS, that fall well-within our approximations. Numerical estimations presented in this paper indicate that impedance-induced energy spread is sufficient to seriously degrade the FEL performance.

In order to constrain the origin of the IMF, we investigated the internal and relative motions of starless condensations and protostars previously detected by us in the dust continuum at 1.2mm in the L1688 protocluster of the Ophiuchus molecular cloud complex. The starless condensations have a mass spectrum resembling the IMF and are therefore likely representative of the initial stages of star formation in the protocluster. We carried out detailed molecular line observations, including some N2H+(1-0) mapping, of the Ophiuchus protocluster condensations using the IRAM 30m telescope. We measured subsonic or at most transonic levels of internal turbulence within the condensations, implying virial masses which generally agree within a factor of ~ 2 with the masses derived from the 1.2mm dust continuum. This supports the notion that most of the L1688 starless condensations are gravitationally bound and prestellar in nature. We measured a global one-dimensional velocity dispersion of less than 0.4 km/s between condensations. This small relative velocity dispersion implies that, in general, the condensations do not have time to interact with one another before evolving into pre-main sequence objects. Our observations support the view that the IMF is partly determined by cloud fragmentation at the prestellar stage. Competitive accretion is unlikely to be the dominant mechanism at the protostellar stage in the Ophiuchus protocluster, but it may possibly govern the growth of starless, self-gravitating condensations initially produced by gravoturbulent fragmentation toward an IMF, Salpeter-like mass spectrum.

Our method utilizes a likelihood-based approach to simultaneously fit the top-quark mass and the jet energies, while accounting for the detector effects and the background contamination. We collect a dataset of 2.7 fb^ of p$̅ collisions at√(=)1.96TeV and select 141 events with at least oneb-tagged jet and significant missingE_T. The resulting top-quark mass measurement is172.8±2.1 ±1.9GeV, which is in agreement with the world average and demonstrates the potential of this approach for precision top-quark mass measurements. Our method provides a valuable tool for future top-quark mass measurements at the LHC and future colliders."}

We then study the model of a bit-flip code with each qubit coupled to an independent bath qubit and subject to continuous correction, and find its solution. We show that for sufficiently large error-correction rates, the encoded state approximately follows an evolution of the type of a single decohering qubit, but with an effectively decreased coupling constant. The factor by which the coupling constant is decreased scales quadratically with the error-correction rate. This is compared to the case of Markovian noise, where the decoherence rate is effectively decreased by a factor which scales only linearly with the rate of error correction. The quadratic enhancement depends on the existence of a Zeno regime in the Hamiltonian evolution which is absent in purely Markovian dynamics. We analyze the range of validity of this result and identify two relevant time scales.

Motivated by the hypothesis that massive young star clusters located in metal-poor, low-metallicity galaxies are a natural birthsite for GRB progenitors, we present a comparison study of the ISM properties along the sightline toward the super star cluster, NGC1705-1, and those in distant GRB hosts. Using the same set of metal transitions in the UV and applying known ISM structures in NGC1705, we find that NGC1705-1 resembles distant GRB host galaxies in its high neutral gas column, low molecular gas fraction, low metallicity, alpha-element enhancement,and low dust depletion. The lack of molecular gas is due to the enhanced UV radiation field in the starburst environment, consistent with the expectations for GRB progenitors. In addition, the known presence of dense neutral gas clouds at r<500 pc from NGC1705-1 provides a natural reservoir of C^+, Si^+, and Fe^+ ions that may be subsequently excited by the afterglow UV radiation field to produce excited lines commonly seen in GRB host ISM. We further argue that the apparent offset in the velocity profiles of low- and high-ionization transitions from absorption-line observations alone already offers important clues for related starburst episodes in GRB host galaxies. Our study shows that a statistical comparison between the ISM around star clusters and high-redshift GRB progenitors is important for identifying the key physical parameters that facilitate the formation of GRBs.

It actually yields Nash equilibria that define a proper subclass of Nash equilibria. In 1965, Selten named this proper subclass subgame perfect equilibria. In game theory, payoffs are rewards usually granted at the end of a game. Although traditional game theory mainly focuses on real-valued payoffs that are implicitly ordered by the usual total order over the reals, works of Simon or Blackwell already involved partially ordered payoffs. This paper generalises the notion of sequential game by replacing real-valued payoff functions with abstract atomic objects, called outcomes, and by replacing the usual total order over the reals with arbitrary binary relations over outcomes, called preferences. This introduces a general abstract formalism where Nash equilibrium, subgame perfect equilibrium, and ``backward induction'' can still be defined. This paper proves that the following three propositions are equivalent: 1) Preferences over the outcomes are acyclic. 2) Every sequential game has a Nash equilibrium. 3) Every sequential game has a subgame perfect equilibrium.

We use the idea of oscillations induced by the hump of the orbital velocity profile (related to locally non-rotating frames - LNRF) in discs orbiting near-extreme Kerr black holes, which are characterized by a \"humpy frequency\" f_h, that could excite the radial and vertical epicyclic oscillations with frequencies f_r, f_v. Due to non-linear resonant phenomena the combinational frequencies are allowed as well. Assuming mass M=14.8M_sun and spin a=0.9998 for the GRS 1915+105 Kerr black hole, the model predicts frequencies f_h=41Hz, f_r=67Hz, (f_h+f_r)=108Hz, (f_v-f_r)=170Hz corresponding quite well to the observed ones. For black-hole parameters being in good agreement with those given observationally, the forced resonant phenomena in non-linear oscillations, excited by the \"hump-induced\" oscillations in a Keplerian disc, can explain high-frequency QPOs in GRS 1915+105 within the range of observational errors.

The mechanical strength of the surface is given only by skeletons, and no two-dimensional bending energy is assumed in the Hamiltonian. The skeletons are composed of elastic linear-chains and rigid junctions and form a compartmentalized structure on the surface, and for this reason the vertices of triangles can diffuse freely only inside the compartments. As a consequence, an inhomogeneous structure is introduced in the model; the surface strength inside the compartments is different from the surface strength on the compartments. However, the rotational symmetry is not influenced by the elastic skeletons; there is no specific direction on the surface. In addition to the three phases mentioned above, a collapsed phase is expected to exist in the low bending rigidity regime that was not studied here.

Comparisons of numerical and experimental results for glass beads in the 10kPa-10MPa range reveal similar differences between dry samples compacted by vibrations and lubricated packings.

Tenuous, fragile networks respond differently to changes in load direction, as compared to load intensity. The shear modulus, in poorly coordinated packings, tends to vary proportionally to the degree of force indeterminacy per unit volume. The elastic range extends to small strain intervals, in agreement with experimental observations. The origins of nonelastic response are discussed.

A total of 570 galaxies with photometric redshifts in the range 0.155 < z_phot < 0.185 are visually classified by three independent classifiers to M_V=-18. These morphological classifications are compared to local galaxy density, distance from the nearest cluster centre, local surface mass density from weak lensing, and photometric classification. At high local galaxy densities, log(Sigma_10 /Mpc^2) > 1.5, a classical morphology-density relation is found. A correlation is also found between morphology and local projected surface mass density, but no trend is observed with distance to the nearest cluster. This supports the finding that local environment is more important to galaxy morphology than global cluster properties. The breakdown of the morphological catalogue by colour shows a dominance of blue galaxies in the galaxies displaying late-type morphologies and a corresponding dominance of red galaxies in the early-type population. Using the 17-band photometry from COMBO-17, we further split the supercluster red sequence into old passive galaxies and galaxies with young stars and dust according to the prescription of Wolf et al.

The general set of linearized equations is derived and the two-dimensional case is considered in detail. The Boussinesq approximation is used in order to examine relatively small-scale perturbations of low-frequency modes: Gravito-Alfven waves (GAW) and Entropy Mode (EM) perturbations. It is shown that for flows with arbitrary shearing rate there exists a finite time interval of non-adiabatic evolution of the perturbations. The non-adiabatic behavior manifests itself in a twofold way, viz. by the over-reflection of the GAWs and by the generation of GAWs from EM perturbations. It is shown that these phenomena act as efficient transformers of the equilibrium flow energy into the energy of the perturbations for moderate and high shearing rate solar plasma flows. Efficient generation of GAW by EM takes place for shearing rates about an order of magnitude smaller than necessary for development of a shear instability. The latter fact could have important consequences for the problem of angular momentum redistribution within the Sun and solar-type stars.

In this study we present a computational reconstruction approach to the problem of network organization, by considering the topological and spatial features of each area in the primate cerebral cortex as subsidy for the reconstruction of the global cortical network connectivity. Starting with all areas being disconnected, pairs of areas with similar sets of features are linked together, in an attempt to recover the original network structure. Inferring primate cortical connectivity from the properties of the nodes, remarkably good reconstructions of the global network organization could be obtained, with the topological features allowing slightly superior accuracy to the spatial ones. Analogous reconstruction attempts for the C. elegans neuronal network resulted in substantially poorer recovery, indicating that cortical area interconnections are relatively stronger related to the considered topological and spatial properties than neuronal projections in the nematode. The close relationship between area-based features and global connectivity may hint on developmental rules and constraints for cortical networks.

The new simulations follow evolution of the CR distribution to much higher energies than our previous study, providing a better examination of evolutionary and asymptotic behaviors. The postshock CR pressure becomes constant after quick initial adjustment, since the evolution of the CR partial pressure expressed in terms of a momentum similarity variable is self-similar. The shock precursor, which scales as the diffusion length of the highest energy CRs, subsequently broadens approximately linearly with time, independent of diffusion model, so long as CRs continue to be accelerated to ever-higher energies. This means the nonlinear shock structure can be described approximately in terms of the similarity variable, x/(u_s t), where u_s is the shock speed once the postshock pressure reaches an approximate time asymptotic state. As before, the shock Mach number is the key parameter determining the evolution and the CR acceleration efficiency, although finite Alfven wave drift and wave energy dissipation in the shock precursor reduce the effective velocity change experienced by CRs, so reduce acceleration efficiency noticeably, thus, providing a second important parameter at low and moderate Mach numbers.

This paper opens up research regarding this issue by proposing a dynamic object evaluation framework (DOEF). DOEF accomplishes access pattern change by defining configurable styles of change. It is a preliminary prototype that has been designed to be open and fully extensible. Though originally designed for the object-oriented model, it can also be used within the object-relational model with few adaptations. Furthermore, new access pattern change models can be added too. To illustrate the capabilities of DOEF, we conducted two different sets of experiments. In the first set of experiments, we used DOEF to compare the performances of four state of the art dynamic clustering algorithms. The results show that DOEF is effective at determining the adaptability of each dynamic clustering algorithm to changes in access pattern. They also led us to conclude that dynamic clustering algorithms can cope with moderate levels of access pattern change, but that performance rapidly degrades to be worse than no clustering when vigorous styles of access pattern change are applied. In the second set of experiments, we used DOEF to compare the performance of two different object stores: Platypus and SHORE. The use of DOEF exposed the poor swapping performance of Platypus.

The study of diffusion on such networks is motivated by transport on randomly folded polymer chains, synchronization problems in task-completion networks, and gradient driven transport on networks. Changing the parameters of the distance-dependence, we found a rich phase diagram, with different transient and recurrent phases in the context of random walks on networks. We performed the calculations in two limiting cases: in the annealed case, where the rearrangement of the random links is fast, and in the quenched case, where the link rearrangement is slow compared to the motion of the random walker or the surface. It has been well-established that in a large class of interacting systems, adding an arbitrarily small density of, possibly long-range, quenched random links to a regular lattice interaction topology, will give rise to mean-field (or annealed) like behavior. In some cases, however, mean-field scaling breaks down, such as in diffusion or in the Edwards-Wilkinson process in \"low-dimensional\" small-world networks. This break-down can be understood by treating the random links perturbatively, where the mean-field (or annealed) prediction appears as the lowest-order term of a naive perturbation expansion. The asymptotic analytic results are also confirmed numerically by employing exact numerical diagonalization of the network Laplacian. Further, we construct a finite-size scaling framework for the relevant observables, capturing the cross-over behaviors in finite networks.

The nuclear sources seen in direct HST images in these galaxies are found to be highly polarized with levels in the range ~2-11 % with a median value of 7 %. We discuss the different mechanisms that produce polarized emission and conclude that the only viable interpretation is a synchrotron origin for the optical nuclei. This idea is strengthened by the analogy with the polarization properties of BL Lac objects, providing also further support to the FRI/BL Lac unified model. This confirms previous suggestions that the dominant emission mechanism in low luminosity radio-loud AGN is related to non-thermal radiation produced by the base of their jets. In addition to the nuclear polarization (and to the large scale optical jets), polarization is detected co-spatially with the dusty circumnuclear disks, likely due to dichroic transmission; the polarization vectors are tangential to the disks as expected when the magnetic field responsible for the grains alignment is stretched by differential rotation. We explored the possibility to detect the polarimetric signature of a misaligned radiation beam in FR I, expected in our sources in the frame of the FR I/ BL Lac unification. We did not find this effect in any of the galaxies, but our the results are not conclusive on whether a misaligned beam is indeed present in FR I.

We find that boxy galaxies originate from mergers with a progenitor mass ratio $n < 2$ and with a combined cold gas mass fraction $F_{\\rm cold} < 0.1$. Our model accurately reproduces the observed fraction of boxy systems as a function of luminosity and halo mass, for both central galaxies and satellites. After correcting for the stellar mass dependence, the properties of the last major merger of early-type galaxies are independent of their halo mass. This provides theoretical support for the conjecture of Pasquali et al (2007) that the stellar mass of an early-type galaxy is the main parameter that governs its isophotal shape. We argue that the observed dichotomy of early-type galaxies has a natural explanation within hierarchical structure formation, and does not require AGN feedback. Rather, we argue that it owes to the fact that more massive systems (i) have more massive progenitors, (ii) assemble later, and (iii) have a larger fraction of early-type progenitors. Each of these three trends causes the cold gas mass fraction of the progenitors of more massive early-types to be lower, so that their last major merger was dryer. Finally, our model predicts that (i) less than 10 percent of all early-type galaxies form in major mergers that involve two early-type progenitors, (ii) more than 95 percent of all boxy early-type galaxies with $M_* < 2 \\times 10^{10} h^{-1} \\Msun$ are satellite galaxies, and (iii) about 70 percent of all low mass early-types do not form a supermassive black hole binary at their last major merger.

With this interpretation, we are able to construct a spatially resolved extinction map across the cluster which is used to derive the intrinsic flux distribution. Fitting cluster profiles (King and EFF) to the intrinsic images we find that the cluster is 15-30% larger than previous estimates, and that no strong evidence of mass segregation in this cluster exists. Using the optical spectra, we find that the age of M82F is 60-80 Myr and from its velocity conclude that the cluster is not physically associated with a large HII region that it is projected upon, both in agreement with previous studies. The reconstructed integral field maps show that that majority of the line emission comes from a nearby HII region. The spatial dependence of the line widths (implying the presence of multiple components)measured corresponds to the extinction map derived from photometry, indicating that the gas/dust clouds responsible for the extinction are also partially ionised. Even with the wealth of observations presented here, we do not find a conclusive solution to the problem of the high light-to-mass ratio previously found for this cluster and its possible top-heavy stellar IMF.

The analogy enables one to introduce all the powerful tools of relativistic QED (albeit in a greatly simplified form). The Feynman diagrams and the propagators turn out to be very useful. In particular, the QED concept of the vacuum polarization finds its close counterpart in the photon scattering off a two level-system leading via the linear response theory to the general formulas for the atomic polarizability and the dynamic single spin susceptibility. To illustrate the usefulness of these methods, we calculate the polarizability and susceptibility up to the fourth order of perturbation theory. These {\\em ab initio} calculations resolve some ambiguities concerning the sign prescription and the optical damping that arise in the phenomenological treatment. We also show that the methods used to study two-level systems (qubits) can be extended to many-level systems (qudits).

The main question that we intend to answer is whether the super-massive black holes powering these QSOs grew out from the seeds planted by the first intermediate massive black holes created in the universe. This question involves a dynamical range of 10^13 in mass and we address it by combining N-body simulations of structure formation to identify the most massive halos at z~6 with a Monte Carlo method based on linear theory to obtain the location and formation times of the first light halos within the whole simulation box. We show that the descendants of the first ~10^6 Msun virialized halos do not, on average, end up in the most massive halos at z~6, but rather live in a large variety of environments. The oldest PopIII progenitors of the most massive halos at z~6, form instead from density peaks that are on average one and a half standard deviations more common than the first PopIII star formed in the volume occupied by one bright high-z QSO. The intermediate mass black hole seeds planted by the very first PopIII stars at z>40 can easily grow to masses m_BH>10^9.5 Msun by z=6 assuming Eddington accretion with radiative efficiency \\epsilon~0.1. Quenching of the black hole accretion is therefore crucial to avoid an overabundance of supermassive black holes at lower redshift. This can be obtained if the mass accretion is limited to a fraction \\eta~6*10^{-3} of the total baryon mass of the halo hosting the black hole.

The dynamical evolution of a 0.9 Msun + 0.6 Msun CO white dwarf merger is followed by a three-dimensional SPH simulation. We use an elaborate prescription in which artificial viscosity is essentially absent, unless a shock is detected, and a much larger number of SPH particles than earlier calculations. Based on this simulation, we suggest that the central region of the merger remnant can, once it has reached quasi-static equilibrium, be approximated as a differentially rotating CO star, which consists of a slowly rotating cold core and a rapidly rotating hot envelope surrounded by a centrifugally supported disc. We construct a model of the CO remnant that mimics the results of the SPH simulation using a one-dimensional hydrodynamic stellar evolution code and then follow its secular evolution. The stellar evolution models indicate that the growth of the cold core is controlled by neutrino cooling at the interface between the core and the hot envelope, and that carbon ignition in the envelope can be avoided despite high effective accretion rates. This result suggests that the assumption of forced accretion of cold matter that was adopted in previous studies of the evolution of double CO white dwarf merger remnants may not be appropriate. Our results imply that at least some products of double CO white dwarfs merger may be considered good candidates for the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae.

Particle interferometry might then reveal non-standard decoherence effects, in addition to standard ones (due to, e.g., finite source size and detector resolution.) In this work we discuss the phenomenology of such non-standard effects in the propagation of electron neutrinos in the Sun and in the long-baseline reactor experiment KamLAND, which jointly provide us with the best available probes of decoherence at neutrino energies E ~ few MeV. In the solar neutrino case, by means of a perturbative approach, decoherence is shown to modify the standard (adiabatic) propagation in matter through a calculable damping factor. By assuming a power-law dependence of decoherence effects in the energy domain (E^n with n = 0,+/-1,+/-2), theoretical predictions for two-family neutrino mixing are compared with the data and discussed.

Examination of the radial dependence of the mass function shows a steeper slope at larger radial distances, indicating mass segregation in the cluster.

This treatment addresses the long-standing challenge of reconciling the disparate scales and physical mechanisms governing these two fundamental quantities. By leveraging the Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations and the lubricant's non-Newtonian rheology, we develop a novel framework that captures the intricate interplay between lubricant flow, surface topography, and contact mechanics. Our approach enables the prediction of film thickness and traction distributions with high accuracy, even in the presence of significant shear-thinning effects. We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of our unified treatment by applying it to a range of EHD configurations, including point contacts and line contacts, and validate our results against experimental data and existing numerical simulations.

We show that, due to the neglection of the nonlinear terms in the electron-heavy hole exchange scattering in the Fermi-golden-rule approach, the spin relaxation due to the Bir-Aronov-Pikus mechanism is greatly exaggerated at moderately high electron density and low temperature in the literature. We compare the spin relaxation time due to the Bir-Aronov-Pikus mechanism with that due to the D'yakonov-Perel' mechanism which is also calculated from the kinetic spin Bloch equations with all the scatterings, especially the spin-conserving electron-electron and electron-heavy hole scatterings, included.

In $p$-type quantum wells, the spin relaxation due to the Bir-Aronov-Pikus mechanism is also much smaller than the one due to the D'yakonov-Perel' mechanism at low temperature and becomes comparable to each other at higher temperature when the hole density and the width of the quantum well are large enough.

The resulting density of states near the Hagedorn temperature resembles the form as for strings in flat space and is dominated by the space-like long string configurations. We then argue a conjectured strings/black hole correspondence in AdS space by applying the Hagedorn thermodynamics. We find the size of the corresponding black hole is a function of the AdS radius. For large AdS radius a black hole far bigger than the string scale will form. On the contrary, when the AdS and string scales are comparable a string size black hole will form.

The weak-lensing signal from a dense distribution of background galaxies (~120 per square arcmin) across the cluster enables the derivation of a high-resolution parameter-free mass map. The strongly-lensed objects tightly constrain the mass structure of the cluster inner region on an absolute scale, breaking the mass-sheet degeneracy. The mass reconstruction of Cl 0024+17 obtained in such a way is remarkable. It reveals a ringlike dark matter substructure at r~75\" surrounding a soft, dense core at r~50\". We interpret this peculiar sub-structure as the result of a high-speed line-of-sight collision of two massive clusters 1-2 Gyr ago. Such an event is also indicated by the cluster velocity distribution. Our numerical simulation with purely collisionless particles demonstrates that such density ripples can arise by radially expanding, decelerating particles that originally comprised the pre-collision cores. Cl 0024+17 can be likened to the bullet cluster 1E0657-56, but viewed $along$ the collision axis at a much later epoch.

Consequently, a numerical programme for determining the metric of the universe from observational data will soon become practical; and thereby realise the ultimate application of Einstein's equations. Apart from detailing the cosmic geometry, this would allow us to verify and quantify homogeneity, rather than assuming it, as has been necessary up to now, and to do that on a metric level, and not merely at the mass distribution level. This paper is the beginning of a project aimed at such a numerical implementation. The primary observational data from our past light cone consists of galaxy redshifts, apparent luminosities, angular diameters and number densities, together with source evolution functions, absolute luminosities, true diameters and masses of sources. Here we start with the simplest case, that of spherical symmetry and a dust equation of state, and execute an algorithm that determines the unknown metric functions from this data. We discuss the challenges of turning the theoretical algorithm into a workable numerical procedure, particularly addressing the origin and the maximum in the area distance. Our numerical method is tested with several artificial data sets for homogeneous and inhomogeneous models, successfully reproducing the original models. This demonstrates the basic viability of such a scheme.

The solution to the generic case then clearly points to the source of the time coincidence integer problem in the Friedman dust universe model.

To investigate this point, we present first results from a radial velocity planet search around red giants in the clump of intermediate-age open clusters. We choose clusters harbouring red giants with masses between 1.5 and 4 M_sun, using the well-known cluster parameters to accurately determine the stellar masses. We are therefore exploring a poorly-known domain of primary masses, which will bring new insights into the properties of extrasolar planetary systems. Methods. We are following a sample of about 115 red giants with the Coralie and HARPS spectrographs to obtain high-precision radial velocity (RV) measurements and detect giant planets around these stars.

With consistently derived outflow properties from a large homogeneous dataset within one molecular cloud we can investigate further the mass dependence and time evolution of protostellar mass loss. Of the 51 cores, 37 show broad linewings indicative of molecular outflows. In 13 cases, the linewings could be due to confusion with neighbouring flows but 9 of those sources also have near-infrared detections confirming their protostellar nature. The total fraction of protostars in our sample is 65%. All but four outflow detections are confirmed as protostellar by Spitzer IR detections and only one Spitzer source has no outflow, showing that outflow maps at this sensitivity are equally good at identifying protostars as Spitzer. Outflow momentum flux correlates both with source luminosity and with core mass but there is considerable scatter even within this one cloud despite the homogeneous dataset. We fail to confirm the result of Bontemps et al. (1996) that Class I sources show lower momentum fluxes on average than Class 0 sources, with a KS test showing a significant probability that the momentum fluxes for both Class 0s and Class Is are drawn from the same distribution. We find that outflow power may not show a simple decline between the Class 0 to Class I stages. Our sample includes low momentum flux, low-luminosity Class 0 sources, possibly at a very early evolutionary stage. If the only mass loss from the core were due to outflows, cores would last for 10^5-10^8 years, longer than current estimates of 1.5-4 x 10^5 years for the mean lifetime for the embedded phase.

Two conjectures, an additional rotation in the fourth curled-up dimension and the weight factors on the eigenvectors, are proposed to serve as a boundary condition to deal with the topologic problem of the 3D Ising model. The partition function of the 3D simple orthorhombic Ising model is evaluated by spinor analysis, by employing these conjectures. Based on the validity of the conjectures, the critical temperature of the simple orthorhombic Ising lattices could be determined by the relation of KK* = KK' + KK'' + K'K'' or sinh 2K sinh 2(K' + K'' + K'K''/K) = 1. For a simple cubic Ising lattice, the critical point is putatively determined to locate exactly at the golden ratio xc = exp(-2Kc) = (sq(5) - 1)/2, as derived from K* = 3K or sinh 2K sinh 6K = 1. If the conjectures would be true, the specific heat of the simple orthorhombic Ising system would show a logarithmic singularity at the critical point of the phase transition. The spontaneous magnetization and the spin correlation functions of the simple orthorhombic Ising ferromagnet are derived explicitly.

The cooperative phenomena near the critical point are studied and the results obtained based on the conjectures are compared with those of the approximation methods and the experimental findings.

This burst has an optically bright afterglow of 16.5 magnitude, detected throughout the 170-650nm spectral range of the UVOT on-board Swift. Observations began with the XRT and UVOT telescopes 286s after the initial trigger and continued for 1.2 x 10^6s. The X-ray lightcurve consists of three power-law segments: a rise until 420s, followed by a slow decay with alpha_2 = 0.63 +/- 0.03 until 5000s, after which, the lightcurve decays faster with a slope of alpha_3 = 1.59 +/- 0.03. The optical lightcurve decays as a single power-law with alpha_O = 0.82 +/- 0.03 throughout the observation. The X-ray data on their own are consistent with the break at 5000s being due to the end of energy injection. Modelling the optical to X-ray spectral energy distribution, we find that the optical afterglow can not be produced by the same component as the X-ray emission at late times, ruling out a single component afterglow. We therefore considered two-component jet models and find that the X-ray and optical emission is best reproduced by a model in which both components are energy injected for the duration of the observed afterglow and the X-ray break at 5000s is due to a jet break in the narrow component. This bright, well-observed burst is likely a guide for interpreting the surprising finding of Swift that bursts seldom display achromatic jet breaks.

The scheme is based on the calculation of the mean force in m.d. simulations in which the height of a chosen molecule above the surface is constrained, and subsequent integration of the mean force to obtain the potential of mean force and hence the chemical potential. The scheme is valid at any coverage and temperature, so that in principle it allows the calculation of the chemical potential as a function of coverage and temperature. It avoids all statistical mechanical approximations, except for the use of classical statistical mechanics for the nuclei, and assumes nothing in advance about the adsorption sites. From the chemical potential, the absolute desorption rate of the molecules can be computed, provided the equilibration rate on the surface is faster than the desorption rate.

We report a sensitive upper limit on its radio flux density of 12 uJy at 2 GHz using the NRAO GBT. Timing using XMM and Chandra over a 2.4 yr span reveals no significant change in its spin period. The 2 sigma upper limit on the period derivative leads, in the dipole spin-down formalism, to an energy loss rate E-dot < 7e33 ergs/s, surface magnetic field strength B_p < 1.5e11 G, and characteristic age tau_c = P/2P-dot > 8 Myr. This tau_c exceeds the age of the SNR by 3 orders of magnitude, implying that the pulsar was born spinning at its current period. However, the X-ray luminosity of PSR J1852+0040, L(bol) ~ 3e33(d/7.1 kpc)^2 ergs/s is a large fraction of E-dot, which challenges the rotation-powered assumption. Instead, its high blackbody temperature, 0.46+/-0.04 keV, small blackbody radius ~ 0.8 km, and large pulsed fraction, ~ 80%, may be evidence of accretion onto a polar cap, possibly from a fallback disk made of supernova debris.

A weak B-field is also inferred in another CCO, the 424-ms pulsar 1E 1207.4-5209, from its steady spin and soft X-ray absorption lines. We propose this origin of radio-quiet CCOs: the B-field, derived from a turbulent dynamo, is weaker if the NS is formed spinning slowly, which enables it to accrete SN debris.

A remarkable feature of this system is the coexistence of precise adaptation in population with large fluctuating cellular behavior in single cells (Korobkova et al. 2004, Nature, 428, 574). Using a stochastic model, we found that the large behavioral variability experimentally observed in non-stimulated cells is a direct consequence of the architecture of this adaptive system. Reversible covalent modification cycles, in which methylation and demethylation reactions antagonistically regulate the activity of receptor-kinase complexes, operate outside the region of first-order kinetics. As a result, the receptor-kinase that governs cellular behavior exhibits a sigmoidal activation curve. This curve simultaneously amplifies the inherent stochastic fluctuations in the system and lengthens the relaxation time in response to stimulus. Because stochastic fluctuations cause large behavioral variability and the relaxation time governs the average duration of runs in response to small stimuli, cells with the greatest fluctuating behavior also display the largest chemotactic response.

In the so-called thick brane model this phenomena is attributed to the thickness of the brane along the extra dimension. In this study we mainly rely to the consistency of this model with most recent observational data related to the background evolution. The new Supernova Type Ia (SNIa) Gold sample and Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) data, the position of the acoustic peak at the last scattering surface from the WMAP observations and the baryon acoustic oscillation peak found in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) are used to constrain the free parameter of the thick codimension 1 brane model. To infer its consistency with age of our universe, we compare the age of old cosmological objects with what computed using the best fit values for the model parameters. When the universe is matter dominated, $w=0$, at 68% level of confidence, the combination of Gold sample SNIa, CMB shift parameter and SDSS databases provides $\\Omega_m=0.31_{-0.02}^{+0.02}$, $\\Omega_{\\cal{C}}=0.05_{-0.01}^{+0.01}$, $w_r=-1.40_{-0.20}^{+0.20}$, hence a spatially open universe with $\\Omega_k=0.21_{-0.08}^{+0.08}$.

The most important example is the detection problem of selecting between the data being consistent with instrument noise alone, or instrument noise and a gravitational wave signal. The analysis of data from ground based gravitational wave detectors is mostly conducted using classical statistics, and methods such as the Neyman-Pearson criteria are used for model selection. Future space based detectors, such as the \\emph{Laser Interferometer Space Antenna} (LISA), are expected to produced rich data streams containing the signals from many millions of sources. Determining the number of sources that are resolvable, and the most appropriate description of each source poses a challenging model selection problem that may best be addressed in a Bayesian framework. An important class of LISA sources are the millions of low-mass binary systems within our own galaxy, tens of thousands of which will be detectable. Not only are the number of sources unknown, but so are the number of parameters required to model the waveforms. For example, a significant subset of the resolvable galactic binaries will exhibit orbital frequency evolution, while a smaller number will have measurable eccentricity. In the Bayesian approach to model selection one needs to compute the Bayes factor between competing models. Here we explore various methods for computing Bayes factors in the context of determining which galactic binaries have measurable frequency evolution. The methods explored include a Reverse Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) algorithm, Savage-Dickie density ratios, the Schwarz-Bayes Information Criterion (BIC), and the Laplace approximation to the model evidence.

The methods used to analyze open cluster remnants and criteria to define them as physical systems are not homogeneous. In this work we present a systematic method for studying these objects that provides a view of their properties and allows their characterization. Eighteen remnant candidates are analyzed by means of photometric and proper motion data. These data provide information on objects and their fields. We establish criteria for characterizing open cluster remnants, taking observational uncertainties into account. 2MASS J and H photometry is employed (i) to study structural properties of the objects by means of radial stellar density profiles, (ii) to test for any similarity between objects and fields with a statistical comparison method applied to the distributions of stars in the CMDs, and (iii) to obtain ages, reddening values, and distances from the CMD, taking an index of isochrone fit into account. The UCAC2 proper motions allowed an objective comparison between objects and large solid angle offset fields. The objective analysis based on the present methods indicates 13 open-cluster remnants in the sample. Evidence of the presence of binary stars is found, as expected for dynamically evolved systems. Finally, we infer possible evolutionary stages among remnants from the structure, proper motion, and CMD distributions. The low stellar statistics for individual objects is overcome by means of the construction of composite proper motion and CMD diagrams. The distributions of remnants in the composite diagrams resemble the single-star and unresolved binary star distributions of open clusters.

Their analysis gives insights into the physics at work in young stellar coronae. The Orion Nebula Cluster offers a unique opportunity to study large samples of young low mass stars. This work is part of the Chandra Orion Ultradeep project (COUP), an ~10 day long X-ray observation of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). Aims. Our main goal is to statistically characterize the flare-like variability of 165 low mass (0.1-0.3 M_sun) ONC members in order to test and constrain the physical scenario in which flares explain all the observed emission. Methods. We adopt a maximum likelihood piece-wise representation of the observed X-ray light curves and detect flares by taking into account both the amplitude and time derivative of the count-rate. We then derive the frequency and energy distribution of the flares. Results. The high energy tail of the energy distribution of flares is well described by a power-law with index 2.2. We test the hypothesis that light curves are built entirely by overlapping flares with a single power law energy distribution. We constrain the parameters of this simple model for every single light curve. The analysis of synthetic light curves obtained from the model indicates a good agreement with the observed data. Comparing low mass stars with stars in the mass interval (0.9-1.2M_sun), we establish that, at ~1 Myr, low mass and solar mass stars of similar X-ray luminosity have very similar flare frequencies. Conclusions. Our observational results are consistent with the following model/scenario: the light curves are entirely built by over- lapping flares with a power-law intensity distribution; the intense flares are individually detected, while the weak ones merge and form a pseudo-quiescent level, which we indicate as the characteristic level.

The velocity distribution function was modeled to closely fit the electron distribution functions observed in the auroral cavity. We systematically varied the model parameters as well as the propagation direction to study the dependence of growth rates on model parameters. The growth rate depends strongly on loss cone opening angle, which must be less than $90^{o}$ for significant CMI growth. The growth rate is sharply peaked for perpendicular radiation ($k_{\\parallel} = 0$), with a full-width at half-maximum $1.7^{o}$, in good agreement with observed k-vector orientations and numerical simulations. The fractional bandwidth varied between 10$^{-4}$ and 10$^{-2}$, depending most strongly on propagation direction. This range encompasses nearly all observed fractional AKR burst bandwidths. We find excellent agreement between the computed RX mode emergent intensities and observed AKR intensities assuming convective growth length $L_c\\approx$20-40 km and group speed 0.15$c$. The only computed LO mode growth rates compatible observed LO mode radiation levels occurred for number densities more than 100 times the average energetic electron densities measured in auroral cavities. This implies that LO mode radiation is not produced directly by the CMI mechanism but more likely results from mode conversion of RX mode radiation. We find that perturbation of the model velocity distribution by large ion solitary waves (ion holes) can enhance the growth rate by a factor of 2-4. This will result in a gain enhancement more than 40 dB depending on the convective growth length within the structure. Similar enhancements may be caused by EMIC waves.

These models suggest that the unique features of Earth are closely connected with its unique U and Th migration models and distribution patterns. In the Earth, U and Th can combine with oxidative volatile components and water, migrate up to the asthenosphere position to form an enrichment zone (EZ) of U and Th first, and then migrate up further to the crusts through magmatism and metamorphism.

The heat-producing elements, currently mainly U and Th, in the EZ are also the energy sources that drive the formation and evolution of the crust of Earth and create special granitic continental crusts.

We find that the response to an applied force evolves according to a stretched exponential, with the exponent reflecting the deviation from equilibrium. After the force is removed, the system ages with time and its subsequent response time scales linearly with its age (simple ageing), meaning that older systems are slower than younger ones. We show that simple ageing can occur naturally in the presence of sufficient quenched disorder.

Starting from the above evidence, supermassive compact objects at the centre of large-mass galaxies are conceived as the end-product of the gravitational collapse of local density maxima around which overdensities are located. At the beginning of evolution, local density maxima are idealized as homogeneous peaks, while the surrounding envelopes are described by a power-law density profile. The dependence of the density profile on a second parameter, chosen to be the ratio between peak and total mass, is analysed. Overdensity evolution is discussed in the context of quintessence cosmological models and further investigation is devoted to a special case with the aim to describe the central collapse. An empirical relation between hole and dark halo mass is translated into a dependence of the fractional hole mass on the overdensity mass. Computations are performed up to the end of central collapse, and density profiles of related configurations are determined together with additional parameters. The central collapse is completed in early times, no longer than a few hundredths of Gyr, which implies hole formation when proto-haloes, proto-bulges, and proto-disks are still expanding or contracting. No appreciable change in evolution is found with regard to different mean peak heights related to equal masses. On the other hand, it is recognized that homogeneous peaks collapse ``faster'' with respect to surroundings envelopes, in low-mass than in large-mass overdensities. In conclusion, it is inferred that gravitational collapse of homogeneous peaks within overdensities may be a viable mechanism for hole generation.

I investigate how the framework for consistent reasoning must be modified in non-classical situations where hypotheses form a continuum, yet the maximum evidence accessible through experiment is not allowed to exceed some finite upper bound. Invoking basic consistency requirements pertaining to the preparation and composition of systems, as well as to the continuity of probabilities, I show that the modified theory must have an internal symmetry isomorphic to the unitary group.

The dust model considers dust-mass return from AGB stars as calculated from synthetic AGB models combined with models for dust condensation in stellar outflows. Supernova dust formation is included in a simple parameterized form which is gauged by observed abundances of presolar dust grains with supernova origin. For dust growth in the ISM a simple method is developed for coupling this with disk and dust evolution models. The time evolution of the abundance of the following dust species is followed in the model: silicate, carbon, silicon carbide, and iron dust from AGB stars and from SNe as well as silicate, carbon, and iron dust grown in molecular clouds. It is shown that the interstellar dust population is dominated by dust accreted in molecular clouds; most of the dust material entering the Solar System at its formation does not show isotopic abundance anomalies of the refractory elements, i.e., inconspicuous isotopic abundances do not point to a Solar System origin of dust grains.

In addition, there are a number of substellar objects, classified as Class III, that have optically thin disks. The Class II members are distributed in an inhomogeneous way, lying preferentially in a filament running toward the south-east. The IR excesses for the Collinder 69 members range from pure Class II (flat or nearly flat spectra longward of 1 micron), to transition disks with no near-IR excess but excesses beginning within the IRAC wavelength range, to two stars with excess only detected at 24 micron. Collinder 69 thus appears to be at an age where it provides a natural laboratory for the study of primordial disks and their dissipation.

Compared with previous calculations, this allows a more sophisticated treatment of recombination, produces predictions for the polarization of the radiation, and allows for reionization. Our derivation is independent of any assumptions about the dynamical behaviour of the field equations, except that it requires anisotropies to be small back to recombination; this is already demanded by observations.   We calculate the polarization signal in the Bianchi VIIh case, with the parameters recently advocated to mimic the several large-angle anomalous features observed in the CMB. We find that the peak polarization signal is ~ 1.2 micro K for the best-fit model to the temperature anisotropies, and is mostly confined to multipoles l<10. Remarkably, the predicted large-angle EE and TE power spectra in the Bianchi model are consistent with WMAP observations that are usually interpreted as evidence of early reionization. However, the power in B-mode polarisation is predicted to be similar to the E-mode power and parity-violating correlations are also predicted by the model; the WMAP non-detection of either of these signals casts further strong doubts on the veracity of attempts to explain the large-angle anomalies with global anisotropy. On the other hand, given that there exist further dynamical degrees of freedom in the VIIh universes that are yet to be compared with CMB observations, we cannot at this time definitively reject the anisotropy explanation.

We have derived global properties for each cluster, such as their mean recessional velocity, velocity dispersion, and virial radii. Cluster galaxies have been grouped in two families according to their $u-r$ colours. The total sample consists of 10865 galaxies. As expected, the highest fraction of galaxies (62%) turned to be early-type (red) ones, being located at smaller distances from the cluster centre and showing lower velocity dispersions than late-type (blue) ones. The brightest cluster galaxies are located in the innermost regions and show the smallest velocity dispersions. Early-type galaxies also show constant velocity dispersion profiles inside the virial radius and a mild decline in the outermost regions. In contrast, late-type galaxies show always decreasing velocity dispersions profiles. No correlation has been found between the fraction of blue galaxies and cluster global properties, such as cluster velocity dispersion and galaxy concentration. In contrast, we found correlation between the X-ray luminosity and the fraction of blue galaxies. These results indicate that early- and late-type galaxies may have had different evolution. Thus, blue galaxies are located in more anisotropic and radial orbits than early-type ones.

In steady state, self-consistency between the two rates of drift requires that a relationship exists between the coefficients of turbulent viscosity and turbulent resistivity. Ignoring any interactions with a stellar magnetosphere, we solve the steady-state equations for a magnetized disk under the gravitational attraction of a mass point and threaded by an amount of magnetic flux consistent with calculations of magnetized gravitational collapse in star formation. Our model mean-field equations have an exact analytical solution that corresponds to magnetically diluted Keplerian rotation about the central mass point. The solution yields the strength of the magnetic field and the surface density as functions of radial position in the disk and their connection with the departure from pure Keplerian rotation in representative cases. We compare the predictions of the theory with the available observations concerning T Tauri stars, FU Orionis stars, and low- and high-mass protostars.

The measurement scheme in this experiment is differential, i.e., allows the direct high-precision measurement of the difference of the Casimir forces between the sphere and sections of the patterned plate or the difference of the equivalent pressures between Au and patterned parallel plates with static and dynamic techniques, respectively. The second experiment proposes to measure the Casimir force between the same sphere and a VO${}_2$ film which undergoes the insulator-metal phase transition with the increase of temperature. We report the present status of the interferometer based variable temperature apparatus developed to perform both experiments and present the first results on the calibration and sensitivity. The magnitudes of the Casimir forces and pressures in the experimental configurations are calculated using different theoretical approaches to the description of optical and conductivity properties of semiconductors at low frequencies proposed in the literature. It is shown that the suggested experiments will aid in the resolution of theoretical problems arising in the application of the Lifshitz theory at nonzero temperature to real materials. They will also open new opportunities in nanotechnology.

The Schroedinger equation is solved by adiabatic expansion, using the conventional adiabatic approximation as a starting point, and re-inserting the result into the Schroedinger equation to yield a second order correction. Closed expressions for arbitrary pulse shapes and diffraction orders are obtained and the losses of the population to output states otherwise forbidden by the Bragg condition are derived. We consider the phase shift due to couplings of the desired output to these states that depends on the interaction strength and duration and show how these can be kept negligible by a choice of smooth (e.g., Gaussian) envelope functions even in situations that substantially violate the adiabaticity condition.

While, at 10000 K, the bulky gas would absorb Lyman lines fully, at 50000K it emits superradiant lines. As superradiance de-excites the atoms strongly, nearly all available energy is emitted in a few competing modes: Superradiance appears only for beams which cross the largest column densities; for an observation from Earth, these beams generate three elliptical hollow cylinders whose bases are the observed rings; admitting that the Earth is not in a privileged direction, these cylinders envelope ellipsoidal shells observed, for the external rings, by photon echoes. For the equatorial ring, the brightness of the superradiant beams is multiplied by a quasi-resonant induced scattering of the rays emitted by the star. The de-excitation of atoms by emitted beams cools the gas strongly, so that ionization decreases fast, the process self accelerates. The energy of the high radiance rays from the star is strongly scattered to the ring while the low radiance of the glow which surrounds the star is rather amplified. The fast absorption of the radial beams produces the radial decrease of radiance of the ring while a competition of modes produces the pearls.

Consistency requires that the corresponding box measurements be complementary as well. At first sight it seems, however, that these measurements can be jointly performed with arbitrary precision: they pertain to different systems (the center of mass of the box and an internal clock, respectively). But this is deceptive. As we show by explicit calculation, although the relevant quantities are simultaneously measurable, they develop non-vanishing commutators when calculated back to the time of escape of the photon. This justifies Bohr's qualitative arguments in a precise way; and it illustrates how the details of the dynamics conspire to guarantee the requirements of complementarity. In addition, our calculations exhibit a ``fine structure'' in the distribution of the uncertainties over the complementary quantities: depending on when the box measurement is performed, the resulting quantum description of the photon differs.

This work is a straightforward extension of Ostriker (1999) who studied the case of a straight-line trajectory. The circular orbit causes the bending of the wake in the background medium along the orbit, forming a long trailing tail. The wake distribution is thus asymmetric, giving rise to the drag forces in both opposite (azimuthal) and lateral (radial) directions to the motion of the perturber, although the latter does not contribute to orbital decay much. For subsonic motion, the density wake with a weak tail is simply a curved version of that in Ostriker and does not exhibit the front-back symmetry. The resulting drag force in the opposite direction is remarkably similar to the finite-time, linear-trajectory counterpart. On the other hand, a supersonic perturber is able to overtake its own wake, possibly multiple times, and develops a very pronounced tail. The supersonic tail surrounds the perturber in a trailing spiral fashion, enhancing the perturbed density at the back as well as far front of the perturber. We provide the fitting formulae for the drag forces as functions of the Mach number, whose azimuthal part is surprisingly in good agreement with the Ostriker's formula, provided Vp t=2 Rp, where Vp and Rp are the velocity and orbital radius of the perturber, respectively.

In silcio modeling is considered to be an increasingly promising tool to add useful insights into the dynamics of the EGFR signal transduction pathway. However, most of the previous modeling work focused on the molecular or the cellular level only, neglecting the crucial feedback between these scales as well as the interaction with the heterogeneous biochemical microenvironment.   Results We developed a multiscale model for investigating expansion dynamics of NSCLC within a two-dimensional in silico microenvironment. At the molecular level, a specific EGFR-ERK intracellular signal transduction pathway was implemented. Dynamical alterations of these molecules were used to trigger phenotypic changes at the cellular level. Examining the relationship between extrinsic ligand concentrations, intrinsic molecular profiles and microscopic patterns, the results confirmed that increasing the amount of available growth factor leads to a spatially more aggressive cancer system. Moreover, for the cell closest to nutrient abundance, a phase-transition emerges where a minimal increase in extrinsic ligand abolishes the proliferative phenotype altogether.   Conclusions Our in silico results indicate that, in NSCLC, in the presence of a strong extrinsic chemotactic stimulus, and depending on the cell's location, downstream EGFR-ERK signaling may be processed more efficiently, thereby yielding a migration-dominant cell phenotype and overall, an accelerated spatio-temporal expansion rate.

The dilaton to matter coupling \"constant\" $f$ appears to be dependent of the matter density. In normal conditions, i.e. when the matter energy density is many orders of magnitude larger than the dilaton contribution to the dark energy density, $f$ becomes less than the ratio of the \"mass of the vacuum\" in the volume occupied by the matter to the Planck mass. The model yields this kind of \"Archimedes law\" without any especial (intended for this) choice of the underlying action and without fine tuning of the parameters.

The B-DMFT is applicable for arbitrary values of the coupling parameters and temperature and becomes exact in the limit of high spatial dimensions d or coordination number Z of the lattice. In contrast to its fermionic counterpart the construction of the B-DMFT requires different scalings of the hopping amplitudes with Z depending on whether the bosons are in their normal state or in the Bose-Einstein condensate. A detailed discussion of how this conceptual problem can be overcome by performing the scaling in the action rather than in the Hamiltonian itself is presented. The B-DMFT treats normal and condensed bosons on equal footing and thus includes the effects caused by their dynamic coupling. It reproduces all previously investigated limits in parameter space such as the Beliaev-Popov and Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approximations and generalizes the existing mean-field theories of interacting bosons. The self-consistency equations of the B-DMFT are those of a bosonic single-impurity coupled to two reservoirs corresponding to bosons in the condensate and in the normal state, respectively. We employ the B-DMFT to solve a model of itinerant and localized, interacting bosons analytically. The local correlations are found to enhance the condensate density and the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) transition temperature T_{BEC}. This effect may be used experimentally to increase T_{BEC} of bosonic atoms in optical lattices.

The high-resolution VLBI images of seven sources all show a core-jet structure. We estimated the proper motions of three sources with the VLBI archive data, and find that the apparent speed increases with the distance of components to the core for all of them. In our BL Lacs sample, the Doppler factor of LBLs is systematically larger than that of IBLs and HBLs. We find a significant anti-correlation between the total 408 MHz luminosity and the intrinsic synchrotron peak frequency. However, the scatter is much larger than for the blazar sequence. Moreover, we find a significant positive correlation between the viewing angle and the intrinsic synchrotron peak frequency. The BL Lac objects show a continuous distribution on the viewing angle. While LBLs have a smaller viewing angle than that of IBLs and HBLs, IBLs are comparable to HBLs.

We argue that the gas in the central regions of protogalactic halos will fragment as long as it carries sufficient angular momentum. Rotation leads to the build-up of massive disk-like structures which fragment to form protostars. At metallicities Z ~ 10^-5 Zsun, dust cooling becomes effective and leads to a sudden drop of temperature at densities above n = 10^12 cm^-3. This induces vigorous fragmentation, leading to a very densely-packed cluster of low-mass stars. This is the first stellar cluster. The mass function of stars peaks below 1 Msun, similar to what is found in the solar neighborhood, and comparable to the masses of the very-low metallicity subgiant stars recently discovered in the halo of our Milky Way. We find that even purely primordial gas can fragment at densities 10^14 cm^-3 < n < 10^16 cm^-3, although the resulting mass function contains only a few objects (at least a factor of ten less than the Z = 10^-5 Zsun mass function), and is biased towards higher masses. A similar result is found for gas with Z = 10^-6 Zsun. Gas with Z <= 10^-6 Zsun behaves roughly isothermally at these densities (with polytropic exponent gamma ~ 1.06) and the massive disk-like structures that form due to angular momentum conservation will be marginally unstable. As fragmentation is less efficient, we expect stars with Z <= 10^-6 Zsun to be massive, with masses in excess of several tens of solar masses, consistent with the results from previous studies.

Methods: We carefully align image sequences taken simultaneously in C IV with the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer and in H-alpha with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope. We examine the temporal evolution of \"dynamic fibrils\", i.e., individual short-lived active-region chromospheric jet-like features in H-alpha. Results: All dynamic fibrils appear as absorption features in H-alpha that progress from the blue to the red wing through the line, and often show recurrent behavior. Some of them, but not all, appear also as bright features in C IV which develop at or just beyond the apex of the H-alpha darkening. They tend to best resemble the H-alpha fibril at +700 mA half a minute earlier. Conclusions: Dynamic chromospheric fibrils observed in H-alpha regularly correspond to transition-region jets observed in the ultraviolet. This correspondence suggests that some plasma associated with dynamic fibrils is heated to transition-region temperatures.

The calculated transmission spectra of two configurations are strikingly distinctive. The open form lacks any significant transmission peak within a wide energy window, while the closed structure has two significant transmission peaks on the both sides of the Fermi level. The electronic transport properties of the molecular junction with closed structure under a small bias voltage are mainly determined by the tail of the transmission peak contributed unusually by the perturbed lowest perturbed unoccupied molecular orbital. The calculated on-off ratio of currents between the closed and open configurations is about two orders of magnitude, which reproduces the essential features of the experimental measured results.

Fully-parallel manipulators are known for the existence of particularly undesirable singularities (referred to as parallel singularities) where control is lost [4] and [6]. On the other hand, due to their cantilever type of kinematic arrangement, fully serial manipulators suffer from a lack of stiffness and from relatively large positioning errors. The hybrid manipulator studied is intrinsically stiffer and more accurate. Furthermore, since all actuators are located on the first axis, the inertial effects are considerably reduced. In addition, it is shown that the special kinematic structure of our manipulator has the potential of avoiding parallel singularities by a suitable choice of the \"working mode\", thus leading to larger workspaces.

This result addresses a long-standing uncertainty in the distance to Orion KL, which has implications for our understanding of the region's star-formation process.

The efficiency of the method is spoiled when the matrix has eigenvalues close to a function discontinuity. This is cured by adding a small number of critical eigenvectors to the Krylov subspace, for which we propose two different deflation schemes. The ensuing modified Arnoldi method is then applied to the sign function, which has a discontinuity along the imaginary axis. The numerical results clearly show the improved efficiency of the method.

This outburst is characterised by strong irradiation of the front face of the secondary star by the white dwarf, an overflowing stream which is seen strongly in HeII and by a dip in the light curves, which extends from 0.1-0.6 in the binary and spin phases. Strong irradiation of the accretion curtain and that of the inner regions of the disc led to strong emission of HeII and to the suppression of the Hg and Hb emission.   Disc overflow was observed in quiescence in earlier studies, where the overflow stream material was modulated at high velocities close to 1000 km/s. In outburst, the overflowing material is modulated at even higher velocities (~1500 km/s). These are streaming velocities down the field lines close to the white dwarf. Evidence for material collecting near the outer edge of the disc and corotating with the accretion curtain was observed. In decline, this material and the accretion curtain obscured almost all the emission near binary phase 0.4, causing a dip. The dip minimum nearly corresponds with spin pulse minimum. This has provided additional evidence for an extended accretion curtain, and for the corotation of material with the accretion curtain at the outer edge of the disc. From these observations we suggest that a mechanism similar to that of Spruit & Taam, where outbursts result due to the storage and release of matter outside the magnetosphere, triggers the outbursts of EX Hya.

Thus they have significant potential for technological applications provided adequate methods of control can be devised. Here we describe a simple, physically realizable pattern-control based on the notion of driven precipitation, meaning that the phase-separation is governed by a guiding field such as, for example, a temperature or a pH field. The phase-separation is modeled through a non-autonomous Cahn-Hilliard equation whose spinodal is determined by the evolving guiding field. Control over the dynamics of the spinodal gives control over the velocity of the instability front which separates the stable and unstable regions of the system. Since the wavelength of the pattern is largely determined by this velocity, the distance between successive precipitation bands becomes controllable. We demonstrate the above ideas by numerical studies of a 1D system with diffusive guiding field. We find that the results can be accurately described by employing a linear stability analysis (pulled-front theory) for determining the velocity -- local-wavelength relationship. From the perspective of the Liesegang theory, our results indicate that the so-called revert patterns may be naturally generated by diffusive guiding fields.

In two dimensions (2D) both superconductivity and charge-density waves (CDW) are believed to be anomalous. In superconducting cuprates, critical transition temperatures are unusually high and the energy gap may stay unclosed even above these temperatures (pseudogap). In CDW-bearing dichalcogenides the resistivity below the transition can decrease with temperature even faster than in the normal phase and a basic prerequisite for the CDW, the favourable nesting conditions (when some sections of the Fermi surface appear shifted by the same vector), seems to be absent. Notwithstanding the existence of alternatives to conventional theories, both phenomena in 2D still remain the most fascinating puzzles in condensed matter physics. Using the latest developments in high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) here we show that the normal-state pseudogap also exists in one of the most studied 2D examples, dichalcogenide 2H-TaSe2, and the formation of CDW is driven by a conventional nesting instability, which is masked by the pseudogap.

Subsequently, an RB peptide corresponding to the proposed RB binding site for insulin was found to recognize full-length insulin in vitro. As part of efforts aimed at developing this RB peptide into an anti-cancer drug, this molecule was chemically coupled to a cellular internalization signal and termed \"MCR peptide\". Meanwhile, several such MCR peptide variants have been demonstrated to restrain the proliferation of different human cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, one of the MCR peptides coined MCR-10 was shown to be capable of interfering with the complex formation between insulin and RB in HepG2 human hepatoma cells, as monitored by immunofluorescence. This latter result indicating an in vivo association between insulin and RB was confirmed by a follow-up study combining the methods of co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Here, we provide evidence for the existence of the insulin-RB complex in A549 human non-small cell lung cancer cells. Specifically, we demonstrate this heterodimer by means of a magnetic beads-based immunoprecipitation approach and equally show that this dimer can be disrupted by MCR-4 or MCR-10 each of which is known to possess antiproliferative properties, yet to a much lesser extent by a control peptide. Thus, this investigation has yielded another important proof for the occurrence of the insulin-RB dimer and, furthermore, its validity as a target for antineoplastic MCR peptides.

(2005) showed that circumstellar absorption lines in early Type Ib/c supernova and gamma-ray burst afterglow spectra may reveal the progenitor evolution of the exploding Wolf-Rayet star. While the quoted paper deals with Wolf-Rayet stars which evolved through a red supergiant stage, we investigate here the initially more massive Wolf-Rayet stars which are thought to evolve through a Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) stage. We perform hydrodynamic simulations of the evolution of the circumstellar medium around a 60 Msol star, from the main sequence through the LBV and Wolf-Rayet stages, up to core collapse. We then compute the column density of the circumstellar matter as a function of radial velocity, time and angle. This allows a comparison with the number and blue-shifts, of absorption components in the spectra of LBVs, Wolf-Rayet stars, Type Ib/c supernovae and gamma-ray burst afterglows. Our simulation for the post-LBV stage shows the formation of various absorption components, which are, however, rather short lived; they dissipate on time scales shorter than 50,000yr. As the LBV stage is thought to occur at the beginning of core helium burning, the remaining Wolf-Rayet life time is expected to be one order of magnitude larger. When interpreting the absorption components in the afterglow spectrum of GRB-021004 as circumstellar, it can be concluded that the progenitor of this source did most likely not evolve through an LBV stage. However, a close binary with late common-envelope phase (Case C) may produce a circumstellar medium that closely resembles the LBV to Wolf-Rayet evolution, but with a much shorter Wolf-Rayet period.

Our analysis reveals a distinct signature of CASLs in the spectra of GRB/SN host galaxies, which is absent in control galaxies. The CASLs are characterized by a unique blend of absorption lines, including C IV, N V, and O VI, which are consistent with the presence of a dense, ionized circumstellar medium. We demonstrate that the CASLs are not solely due to the presence of a foreground galaxy or an intervening gas cloud, but rather are a result of the interaction between the progenitor star and its surrounding environment.

{"source_id": 705.0973, "title": "A Connection Between Bulge Properties and the Bimodality of Galaxies", "abstract": "  The global colors of galaxies have recently been shown to follow bimodal distributions. Galaxies separate into a ``red sequence'', populated prototypically by early-type galaxies, and a ``blue cloud'', whose typical objects are late-type disk galaxies. Intermediate-type (Sa-Sbc) galaxies populate both regions. It has been suggested that this bimodality reflects the two-component nature of disk-bulge galaxies. However, it has now been established that there are two types of bulges: ``classical bulges'' that are dynamically hot systems resembling (little) ellipticals, and ``pseudobulges'', dynamically cold, flattened, disk-like structures that could not have formed via violent relaxation. Therefore thee question is whether at types Sa-Sbc, where both bulge types are found, the red-blue dichotomy separates galaxies at some value of disk-to-bulge ratio, $B/T$, or, whether it separates galaxies of different bulge type, irrespective of their $B/T$. We identify classical bulges and pseudobulges morphologically with HST images in a sample of nearby galaxies. Detailed surface photometry reveals that: (1) The red -- blue dichotomy is a function of bulge type: at the same $B/T$, pseudobulges are in globally blue galaxies and classical bulges are in globally red galaxies. (2) Bulge type also predicts where the galaxy lies in other (bimodal) global structural parameters. (3) Hence, the red -- blue dichotomy is not due to decreasing bulge prominence alone, and the bulge type of a galaxy carries significance for the galaxy's evolutionary history ...

Such intermediate mass ratio inspirals (IMRIs) are most likely to be found in globular clusters. We analyze four possible IMRI formation mechanisms: (1) hardening of an NS-IMBH or BH-IMBH binary via three-body interactions, (2) hardening via Kozai resonance in a hierarchical triple system, (3) direct capture, and (4) inspiral of a compact object from a tidally captured main-sequence star; we also discuss tidal effects when the inspiraling object is an NS. For each mechanism we predict the typical eccentricities of the resulting IMRIs. We find that IMRIs will have largely circularized by the time they enter the sensitivity band of ground-based detectors. Hardening of a binary via three-body interactions, which is likely to be the dominant mechanism for IMRI formation, yields eccentricities under 10^-4 when the GW frequency reaches 10 Hz. Even among IMRIs formed via direct captures, which can have the highest eccentricities, around 90% will circularize to eccentricities under 0.1 before the GW frequency reaches 10 Hz. We estimate the rate of IMRI coalescences in globular clusters and the sensitivity of a network of three Advanced LIGO detectors to the resulting GWs. We show that this detector network may see up to tens of IMRIs per year, although rates of one to a few per year may be more plausible. We also estimate the loss in signal-to-noise ratio that will result from using circular IMRI templates for data analysis and find that, for the eccentricities we expect, this loss is negligible.

Observations included the evidence of light enhancement of Ni toxicity at the root as well as at the whole plant level, the shoot mass index as a possible indicator of shoot metal sequestration in B. juncea, the logarithmic variation of Cp with Cs and the power-law dependence of M on Cp. The sum total of these observations indicate that for the metal accumulator B. juncea with regard to its capacity to accumulate Ni, the overall metabolic nature of the plant is important; neither rapid biomass increase nor a high metal concentration capability favor the removal of high metal mass from the medium, but rather the plant with the moderate photosynthetically driven biomass growth and moderate metal concentrations demonstrated the ability to remove the maximum mass of metal from the medium.

Our results showed that Ni stress significantly inhibited root growth and reduced chlorophyll content, while increasing malondialdehyde production.

Understanding the mechanisms which lead to multiple globular cluster sub-populations is essential for a complete picture of massive galaxy formation. By assuming that globular cluster formation traces the total star formation and taking into account the radial variations in the composite stellar populations predicted by the Pipino & Matteucci (2004) multi-zone photo-chemical evolution code, we compute the distribution of globular cluster properties as a function of galactocentric radius. We compare our results to the spectroscopic measurements of globular clusters in nearby early-type galaxies by Puzia et al. (2006) and show that the observed multi-modality in globular cluster systems of massive ellipticals can be, at least partly, ascribed to the radial variation in the mix of stellar populations. Our model predicts the presence of a super-metal-rich population of globular clusters in the most massive elliptical galaxies, which is in very good agreement with the spectroscopic observations. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of other non-linear mechanisms that shape the metallicity distribution of globular cluster systems, in particular the role of merger-induced globular cluster formation and a non-linear color-metallicity transformation, and discuss their influence in the context of our model (abridged) ", "Prompt": "Generate a concise 150-250 word abstract for the work titled 'The Formation of Globular Cluster Systems in Massive Elliptical Galaxies: Globular Cluster Multimodality from Radial Variation of Stellar Populations' in a single paragraph.

We find that the radial variation of stellar populations within massive elliptical galaxies, resulting from the hierarchical assembly of the galaxy through galaxy mergers, gives rise to distinct globular cluster populations. Our simulations reveal that the formation of globular clusters is closely tied to the radial distribution of gas and stars within the galaxy, with clusters forming preferentially in regions of higher gas density.

In contrast, a larger sample of 30 cluster AGN with L_X > 10^41 erg/s do not show evidence for greater concentration than inactive members, nor evidence for a different kinematic or substructure distribution. As we do see clear differences in the spatial and kinematic distributions of the blue Butcher-Oemler and red galaxy populations, any difference in the AGN and inactive galaxy population must be less distinct than that between these two pairs of populations. Comparison of the AGN fraction selected via X-ray emission in this study to similarly-selected AGN in the field indicates that the AGN fraction is not significantly lower in clusters, contrary to AGN identified via visible-wavelength emission lines, but similar to the approximately constant radio-selected AGN fraction in clusters and the field. We also find significant evidence for variation between clusters and explore the dependence of cluster AGN fraction on redshift, velocity dispersion, cluster substructure, and Butcher-Oemler fraction.

Within this scheme the spin chain is used repeatedly as an entanglement bus (EB) to create multi-partite entanglement. The noise model we consider comprises of each spin of this EB being exposed to independent local noise which degrades the capabilities of the EB. Here we concentrate on quantifying its performance as a single-qubit channel and as a mediator of a two-qubit entangling gate, since these are basic operations necessary for graph state generation using the EB. In particular, for the single-qubit case we numerically calculate the average channel fidelity and whether the channel becomes entanglement breaking, i.e., expunges any entanglement the transferred qubit may have with other external qubits. We find that neither local decay nor dephasing noise cause entanglement breaking. This is in contrast to local thermal and depolarizing noise where we determine a critical length and critical noise coupling, respectively, at which entanglement breaking occurs. The critical noise coupling for local depolarizing noise is found to exhibit a power-law dependence on the chain length. For two qubits we similarly compute the average gate fidelity and whether the ability for this gate to create entanglement is maintained. The concatenation of these noisy gates for the construction of a five qubit linear cluster state and a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state indicates that the level of noise that can be tolerated for graph state generation is tightly constrained.

The gradient is defined with respect to a metric on the space of coupling constants which is explicitly known only to leading order in perturbation theory, but at that order is positive semi-definite, as follows from Perelman's work on the Ricci flow. This gives rise to a monotonicity formula for the flow which is expected to fail only if the beta function perturbation series fails to converge, which can happen if curvatures or their derivatives grow large. We test the validity of the monotonicity formula at next-to-leading order in perturbation theory by explicitly computing the second-order terms in the metric on the space of coupling constants. At this order, this metric is found not to be positive semi-definite. In situations where this might spoil monotonicity, derivatives of curvature become large enough for higher order perturbative corrections to be significant.

A variety of empirical or theoretical formulae with different parameterisations are available in the literature and the agreement between them is anything but good. These simple mass loss prescriptions are nontheless used in many models of stellar evolution without much consideration of their applicability in various cases. We present here an on-going project aiming at a better description of the mass loss, that could be used to improve stellar evolution models -- especially the evolution during the TP-AGB phase. As a first step, we have considered the mass loss evolution during a He-shell flash. Using stellar parameters sampled from a stellar evolutionary track, we have computed the time evolution of the atmospheric layers and wind acceleration region during a flash event with detailed frequency-dependent radiation-hydrodynamical models including dust formation. Based on these results, we have also simulated the subsequent long-term dynamical evolution of the circumstellar envelope (CSE), including the formation of a detached shell. We find that existing simple mass loss prescriptions imply different mass loss evolutions compared with our model. The second step of the project deals with the dependence of mass loss on the basic stellar parameters. At the moment we are computing a large grid of wind models for C-rich AGB stars. Preliminary results show that simple parameterisations are difficult to obtain in certain regions of the parameter space considered, due to strong non-linearities in the wind mechanism.

The HCO+ and CS spectra show clear self-reversed and asymmetric profiles across the face of the globule. The sense of the observed asymmetry is indicative of the global presence of expansion motions in the outer layers of the globule. These motions appear to be subsonic and significantly below the escape velocity of the globule. Comparison of our observations with near-infrared extinction data indicate that the globule is gravitationally bound. Taken together these considerations lead us to suggest that the observed expansion has its origin in an oscillatory motion of the outer layers of the globule which itself is likely in a quasi-stable state near hydrostatic equilibrium. Analysis of the observed linewidths of CO and N2H+ confirm that thermal pressure is the dominant component of the cloud's internal support. A simple calculation suggests that the dominant mode of pulsation would be an l = 2 mode with a period of 0.3 Myr. Deformation of the globule due to the large amplitude l = 2 oscillation may be responsible for the double-peaked structure of the core detected in high resolution extinction maps. Detailed comparison of the molecular-line observations and extinction data provides evidence for significant depletion of C18O and perhaps HCO+ while N2H+ may be undepleted to a cloud depth of about 40 magnitudes of visual extinction.

In this cluster field, two populations are spatially cross-correlated with each other. The relative spatial distribution of LAEs to LBGs is in stark contrast between the QSO and the cluster fields.

The LAEs avoid the nearby region around the QSO where the local UV background radiation could be ~100 times stronger than the average for the epoch. The clustering segregation between LBGs and LAEs seen in the QSO field could be due to either enhanced early galaxy formation in an overdense environment having caused all the LAEs to evolve into LBGs, or local photoionization due to the strong UV radiation from the QSO effectively causing a deficit in low-mass galaxies like LAEs.

Meshes computations form the basis of many applications, e.g. finite-element methods, image rendering, and collision detection. In one important mesh primitive, called a mesh update, each mesh vertex stores a value and repeatedly updates this value based on the values stored in all neighboring vertices. The performance of a mesh update depends on the layout of the mesh in memory.   This paper shows how to find a memory layout that guarantees that the mesh update has asymptotically optimal memory performance for any set of memory parameters. Such a memory layout is called cache-oblivious. Formally, for a $d$-dimensional mesh $G$, block size $B$, and cache size $M$ (where $M=\\Omega(B^d)$), the mesh update of $G$ uses $O(1+|G|/B)$ memory transfers. The paper also shows how the mesh-update performance degrades for smaller caches, where $M=o(B^d)$.   The paper then gives two algorithms for finding cache-oblivious mesh layouts. The first layout algorithm runs in time $O(|G|\\log^2|G|)$ both in expectation and with high probability on a RAM.

For the other four objects, the nondetections at 2.7 mm and in the MSX mid-IR bands are consistent with cool dust emission with a temperature of 13-40K and luminosity of 1000-40000 Lsun. By combining single-dish and interferometric data, we have identified over two dozen virialized C18O cores in this region that contain ~40% of the total molecular gas mass present. While the overall extent of the C18O and dust emission is similar, the emission peaks do not correlate well in detail. At least 11 of the 123 stars identified by 2MASS in this region are likely to be within the star-forming cluster. Two stars (both associated with the UCHII region) were previously identified as O stars via IR spectroscopy. Most of the rest of the reddened stars have no obvious correlation with the C18O cores or the dust cores. In summary, our observations indicate that considerable fragmentation of the molecular cloud has taken place during the time required for the UCHII region to form and the O stars to become detectable at IR wavelengths. Additional star formation appears to be ongoing on the periphery of the central region, where up to four B-type (proto)stars have formed among a substantial number of C18O molecular cores.

We therefore have tried to improve the statistics on sources that have ceased to be active, or are intermittently active. The latter sources would partly consist of a fossil radio plasma left over from an earlier phase of activity, plus a recently restarted core and radio jets. Improving the statistics of dying sources will give us a better handle on the evolution of radio sources, in particular the frequency and time scales of radio activity. We have used the WENSS and NVSS surveys, in order to find sources with steep spectral indices, associated with nearby elliptical galaxies. In the cross correlation we presently used only unresolved sources, with flux densities at 1.4 GHz larger than 10 mJy. The eleven candidates thus obtained were observed with the VLA in various configurations, in order to confirm the steepness of the spectra, and to check whether active structures like flat-spectrum cores and jets are present, perhaps at low levels. We estimated the duration of the active and relic phases by modelling the integrated radio spectra using the standard models of spectral evolution. We have found six dying sources and three restarted sources, while the remaining two candidates remain unresolved also with the new VLA data and may be Compact Steep Spectrum sources, with an unusually steep spectrum. The typical age of the active phase, as derived by spectral fits, is in the range 10^7 - 10^8 years. For our sample of dying sources, the age of the relic phase is on average shorter by an order of magnitude than the active phase.

In previous works, we have proved that for $f(u)=u^p$, $p=2,3,4$, the family of solitons is asymptotically stable in some local sense in $H^1$, i.e. if $u(t)$ is close to $Q_{c}$ (for all $t\\geq 0$), then $u(t,.+\\rho(t))$ locally converges in the energy space to some $Q_{c_+}$ as $t\\to +\\infty$, for some $c^+\\sim c$.

Such a low M_max, due to a kaon condensation in the stellar core, implies collapse of a too massive deleptonized protoneutron star into a black hole. This would naturally explain the lack of a neutron star in the SN1987A remnant. On the other hand, recent evaluation of mass of PSR J0751+1807 gives M_max > 2M_sun. This contradicts the original Bethe-Brown model, but can be reconciled within scenarios proposed in the present Letter. We consider two types of dense matter models with high-density softening, due to a transition from a non-strange N-phase of matter to a strangeness carrying phase S: kaon condensation and deconfinement of quarks. Two scenarios of neutron star formation in stellar core collapse are considered. In the first scenario, realized in sufficiently hot and dense supernova cores, nucleation of an S-phase is sufficiently rapid so as to form an S-phase core, and implying M_max = M^S_max =~ 1.5M_sun. In the second scenario, nucleation of the S-phase at neutron star birth is too slow to materialize, and the star becomes cold without forming an S-phase core. Then, stellar mass can increase via accretion, until central density \\rho_crit is reached, and the S phase forms. This N branch of neutron stars ends at M=M_crit. We select several models of N-phase satifying the necessary condition M^N_max > 2M_sun and combine them with models of kaon condensation and quark deconfinement. For kaon condensation, we get M_crit =~ M^S_max =~ 1.5M_sun, which is ruled out by PSR J0751+1807. On the contrary, for the EOSs with quark deconfinement we get M_crit =~ M^N_max > 2M_sun, which reconciles SN1987A and PSR J0751+1807.

Given the encountered strong degeneracy between numerical resolution and physical assumptions, we suggest here three possible paths followed by the galaxies and the BHs during a merger in order to fulfill the M-sigma relation : Adjustment, Symbiosis, and BH Dominance. In an extremely high resolution run, we resolved the turbulent gas pattern down to parsec scales, and found that BH feedback is expected to be effective near the end of the merger.

This provides sufficient conditions for a process that satisfies the definition of an SRBM, except for small random perturbations in the defining conditions, to be close in distribution to an SRBM. A crucial ingredient in the proof of this result is an oscillation inequality for solutions of a perturbed Skorokhod problem.

We have analyzed spectral signatures of the turbulence for different sets of parameters and different altitudes relative to the turning point of the linear Langmuir mode where the Langmuir frequency equals the local plasma frequency. By a parametric analysis, we have derived a simple scaling law, which links the spectral width of the turbulent frequency spectrum to the physical parameters in the ionosphere.

In this work we present a new family of templates for the detection of gravitational waves from the inspiral of two comparable-mass black hole binaries. These new adiabatic templates are based on re-expressing the derivative of the binding energy and the gravitational wave flux functions in terms of shifted Chebyshev polynomials. The Chebyshev polynomials are a useful tool in numerical methods as they display the fastest convergence of any of the orthogonal polynomials. In this case they are also particularly useful as they eliminate one of the features that plagues the post-Newtonian expansion. The Chebyshev binding energy now has information at all post-Newtonian orders, compared to the post-Newtonian templates which only have information at full integer orders. In this work, we compare both the post-Newtonian and Chebyshev templates against a fiducially exact waveform. This waveform is constructed from a hybrid method of using the test-mass results combined with the mass dependent parts of the post-Newtonian expansions for the binding energy and flux functions. Our results show that the Chebyshev templates achieve extremely high fitting factors at all PN orders and provide excellent parameter extraction.

In 2006 April, the source peaked at a luminosity ~ 3 x 10^{40} erg/s in the 0.3-10 keV band (similar to the maximum luminosity found by ASCA in 1995), and declined on an e-folding timescale ~ 3 days. The X-ray spectrum is always dominated by a broad power-law-like component. When the source is seen at X-ray luminosities ~ 10^{40} erg/s, an additional soft thermal component (which we interpret as emission from the accretion disk) contributes ~ 1/4 of the X-ray flux; when the luminosity is higher, ~ 3 x 10^{40} erg/s, the thermal component is not detected and must contribute < 10% of the flux. At the beginning of the decline, ionized absorption is detected around 0.5-2 keV; it is a possible signature of a massive outflow. The power-law is always hard, with a photon index Gamma ~ 1.7 (and even flatter at times), as is generally the case with bright ULXs. We speculate that this source and perhaps most other bright ULXs are in a high/hard state: as the accretion rate increases well above the Eddington limit, more and more power is extracted from the inner region of the inflow through non-radiative channels, and is used to power a Comptonizing corona, jet or wind. The observed thermal component comes from the standard outer disk; the transition radius between outer standard disk and Comptonizing inner region moves further out and to lower disk temperatures as the accretion rate increases. This produces the observed appearance of a large, cool disk.

Also two-component bottle brush polymers are considered, where two types (A,B) of side chains are grafted, assuming that monomers of different kind repel each other.

Theories predict ``Janus Cylinder''-type phase separation along the backbone in this case. The Monte Carlo simulations, using the pruned-enriched Rosenbluth method (PERM) then are restricted to rather short side chain length. Nevertheless, evidence is obtained that the phase separation between an A-rich part of the cylindrical molecule and a B-rich part can only occur locally.

During storage, the E orientalis population decreases gradually and it disappears completely in less than two months after the beginning of storage. E. Vuilleti population becomes gradually more important than D. basalis population which regress until less than 10 % of the emerging parasitoids. E vuilleti adopts ovicide and larvicide behaviour against D. Basalis. This behaviour explains its population regression inside granaries. If the aggressive behaviour of this Eupelmidae is a constant, that could also explain the disappearance of E orientalis. However if this species is maintained in stocks, it would be an effective control agent of bruchids according to their parasitic capacities. This study shows that ovicide and larvicide behaviour of E vuilleti is not expressed against E orientalis. When the females have exclusively the hosts already parasitized by E orientalis, they do not lay eggs. The disappearance of E orientalis could not thus be explained by the presence of E. vuilleti.

The predicted $D_{sJ}$(2317) abundance depends sensitively on the quark structure of the $D_{sJ}$(2317) meson. An order-of-magnitude larger yield is obtained for a conventional two-quark than for an exotic four-quark $D_{sJ}$(2317) meson.

Here we present a comprehensive collection of quasi-simultaneous OIR and X-ray data from 19 low-magnetic field NSXBs, including new observations of three sources: 4U 0614+09, LMC X-2 and GX 349+2. The average radio-OIR spectrum for NSXBs is alpha ~ +0.2 (where L_nu propto nu^alpha) at least at high luminosities when the radio jet is detected. This is comparable to, but slightly more inverted than the alpha ~ 0.0 found for black hole X-ray binaries. The OIR spectra and relations between OIR and X-ray fluxes are compared to those expected if the OIR emission is dominated by thermal emission from an X-ray or viscously heated disc, or synchrotron emission from the inner regions of the jets. We find that thermal emission due to X-ray reprocessing can explain all the data except at high luminosities for some NSXBs, namely the atolls and millisecond X-ray pulsars (MSXPs). Optically thin synchrotron emission from the jets (with an observed OIR spectral index of alpha_thin < 0) dominate the NIR light above L_x ~ 10^36 erg/s and the optical above L_x ~ 10^37 erg/s in these systems.

The extinction profile of this shadow matches the profile derived from 2MASS photometry at the outer edges of the globule and reaches a maximum of ~32 visual magnitudes at the center. The corresponding mass of CB190 is ~10 Msun. Our 12CO and 13CO J = 2-1 data over a 10 arcmin X 10 arcmin region centered on the shadow show a temperature ~10 K. The thermal continuum indicates a similar temperature for the dust. The molecular data also show evidence of freezeout onto dust grains.

Bonnor-Ebert fits to the density profile, in conjunction with this distance, yield xi_max = 7.2, indicating that CB190 may be unstable. The high temperature (56 K) of the best fit Bonnor-Ebert model is in contradiction with the CO and thermal continuum data, leading to the conclusion that the thermal pressure is not enough to prevent free-fall collapse. We also find that the turbulence in the cloud is inadequate to support it. However, the cloud may be supported by the magnetic field, if this field is at the average level for dark globules.

We present 10 days of nearly continuous optical photometry by the MOST (Microvariability & Oscillations of STars) satellite and partly simultaneous optical spectroscopy from DDO (David Dunlap Observatory) of the binary. The photometric data indicate that the spot coverage of the K dwarf component was less than observed in the past, suggesting that we monitored the star close to a minimum in its activity cycle. Despite the low spot activity, we still detected seven flare-like events whose estimated energies are among the highest ever observed in V471 Tau and whose times of occurrence do not correlate with the binary orbital phase. A detailed O-C analysis of the times of eclipse over the last ~35 years reveals timing variations which could be explained in several ways, including perturbations by an as-yet-undetected third body in the system or by a small orbital eccentricity inducing slow apsidal motion. The DDO spectra result in improved determinations of the K dwarf projected rotation velocity, V_K sin i = 92 km s^-1, and the orbital amplitude, K_K=150.5 km s^-1.

In contrast with the Josephson bifurcation amplifier [17], which has an on-chip capacitor shunting a junction, the resonator is based on a simple coplanar waveguide imposing a pre-determined frequency and whose other RF characteristics like the quality factor are easily controlled and optimized. Under proper microwave irradiation conditions, the CBA has two metastable states. Which state is adopted by the CBA depends on the state of a quantronium qubit coupled to the CBA's junction.

The oxidation schemes considered include hydroxyl, carboxyl, ether, and ketone groups. Using screened exchange density functional theory, we show that these oxidized ribbons are more stable than hydrogen-terminated nanoribbons except for the case of the etheric groups. The stable oxidized configurations maintain a spin-polarized ground state with antiferromagnetic ordering localized at the edges, similar to the fully hydrogenated counterparts. More important, edge oxidation is found to lower the onset electric field required to induce half-metallic behavior and extend the overall field range at which the systems remain half-metallic. Once the half-metallic state is reached, further increase of the external electric field intensity produces a rapid decrease in the spin magnetization up to a point where the magnetization is quenched completely. Finally, we find that oxygen containing edge groups have a minor effect on the energy difference between the antiferromagnetic ground state and the above-lying ferromagnetic state.

By introducing edge oxidation, we observe a significant reduction in the midgap states, leading to the emergence of half-metallic behavior.

One of the main contributors to the robustness and evolvability of biological networks is believed to be their modularity of function, with modules defined as sets of genes that are strongly interconnected but whose function is separable from those of other modules. Here, we investigate the in silico evolution of modularity and robustness in complex artificial metabolic networks that encode an increasing amount of information about their environment while acquiring ubiquitous features of biological, social, and engineering networks, such as scale-free edge distribution, small-world property, and fault-tolerance. These networks evolve in environments that differ in their predictability, and allow us to study modularity from topological, information-theoretic, and gene-epistatic points of view using new tools that do not depend on any preconceived notion of modularity. We find that for our evolved complex networks as well as for the yeast protein-protein interaction network, synthetic lethal pairs consist mostly of redundant genes that lie close to each other and therefore within modules, while knockdown suppressor pairs are farther apart and often straddle modules, suggesting that knockdown rescue is mediated by alternative pathways or modules.

We find that the baryon mass fraction (f_b) within r500 is constant for systems with M500 between 6e13 and 1e15 Msun. Although f_b is lower than the WMAP value, the shortfall is on the order of both the observational systematic uncertainties and the depletion of baryons within r500 that is predicted by simulations. The data therefore provide no compelling evidence for undetected baryonic components, particularly any that vary in importance with cluster mass. A unique feature of the current analysis is direct inclusion of the contribution of intracluster light (ICL) in the baryon budget. The increase in X-ray gas mass fraction with increasing total mass is entirely accounted for by a decrease in the total stellar mass fraction, supporting the argument that the behavior of both the stellar and X-ray gas components is dominated by a decrease in star formation efficiency in more massive environments. Within just the stellar component, the fraction of the total stellar luminosity in the BCG and ICL decreases as velocity dispersion increases, suggesting that the BCG+ICL component, and in particular the dominant ICL component, grows less efficiently in higher mass environments. The degree to which this behavior arises from our sample selection, which favored systems with central, giant elliptical galaxies, remains unclear. A more robust result is the identification of low mass groups with large BCG+ICL components, demonstrating that the creation of intracluster stars does not require a massive cluster environment.

Correspondingly, the theoretical understanding of spin-polarized transport is usually limited to a metallic regime in a linear response, which, while providing a good description for data storage and magnetic memory devices, is not sufficient for signal processing and digital logic. In contrast, much less is known about possible applications of semiconductor-based spintronics and spin-polarized transport in related structures which could utilize strong intrinsic nonlinearities in current-voltage characteristics to implement spin-based logic. Here we discuss the challenges for realizing a particular class of structures in semiconductor spintronics: our proposal for bipolar spintronic devices in which carriers of both polarities (electrons and holes) contribute to spin-charge coupling. We formulate the theoretical framework for bipolar spin-polarized transport, and describe several novel effects in two- and three-terminal structures which arise from the interplay between nonequilibrium spin and equilibrium magnetization.

We constrained the source position using ray-tracing simulations. No such transient source was found at the position in the other Suzaku observations nor in all the available archived images of other X-ray missions for the last ~28 years.

An additional absorption edge at ~0.74 keV was also confirmed, which is presumably due to the absorption by helium-like oxygen ions. Assuming that the source is at the distance of the SMC, the X-ray luminosity in the 0.2-2.0 keV band is ~10^{37} erg s^{-1} and the radius of the source is ~10^{8} cm. The XIS light curve shows about a two-fold decline in X-ray flux during the 24 ks observation. Together with the archived data, the X-ray flux in the burst is at least three orders of magnitude brighter than the undetected quiescent level.

The basic idea under the proposed scheme is based on the notion of spectrum pooling. The idea is quite simple: a cognitive radio will listen to the channel and, if sensed idle, will transmit during the voids. It turns out that, although its simplicity, the proposed scheme showed very interesting features with respect to the spectral efficiency and the maximum number of possible pairwise cognitive communications. We impose the constraint that users successively transmit over available bands through selfish water filling. For the first time, our study has quantified the asymptotic (with respect to the band) achievable gain of using spectrum pooling in terms of spectral efficiency compared to classical radio systems.

This paper provides complexity results for its model checking problem. In particular we consider those fragments of HFL built by using only types of bounded order k and arity m.

For the upper bound we use fixpoint elimination to obtain reachability games that are singly-exponential in the size of the formula and k-fold exponential in the size of the underlying transition system. These games can be solved in deterministic linear time. As a simple consequence, we obtain an exponential time upper bound on the expression complexity of each such fragment.   The lower bound is established by a reduction from the word problem for alternating (k-1)-fold exponential space bounded Turing Machines. Since there are fixed machines of that type whose word problems are already hard with respect to k-fold exponential time, we obtain, as a corollary, k-fold exponential time completeness for the data complexity of our fragments of HFL, provided m exceeds 3.

At present all known string theory inflation models predict tensor modes well below the level of detection. Therefore a possible experimental discovery of tensor modes may present a challenge to string cosmology.

For the gravitino mass in the usual range, m_{3/2} < O(1) TeV, this leads to an extremely strong bound r < 10^{-24}.

It has been proposed by Bodenheimer, Lin & Mardling that undetected companions acting to excite the orbital eccentricity are responsible for these oversized planets, as they find new equilibrium radii in response to being tidally heated. In the case of HD 209458, this hypothesis has been rejected by some authors because there is no sign of such a companion at the 5 m/s level, and because it is difficult to say conclusively that the eccentricity is non-zero. Transit timing analysis [...]. Whether or not a companion is responsible for the large radius of HD 209458b, almost certainly some short-period systems have companions which force their eccentricities to nonzero values. This paper is dedicated to quantifying this effect.   The eccentricity of a short-period planet will only be excited as long as its (non-resonant) companion's eccentricity is non-zero. Here we show that the latter decays on a timescale which depends on the structure of the interior planet, a timescale which is often shorter than the lifetime of the system. This includes Earth-mass planets in the habitable zones of some stars. We determine which configurations are capable of sustaining significant eccentricity for at least the age of the system, and show that these include systems with companion masses as low as a fraction of an Earth mass. The orbital parameters of such companions are consistent with recent calculations which show that the migration process can induce the formation of low mass planets external to the orbits of hot Jupiters. Systems with inflated planets are therefore good targets in the search for terrestrial planets.

Basaltic asteroids can be identified from their visible reflectance spectra and are classified as V-type in the usual taxonomies. In this work, we report visible spectroscopic observations of two candidate V-type asteroids, (7472) Kumakiri and (10537) 1991 RY16, located in the outer Main Belt (a > 2.85 UA). These candidate have been previously identified by Roig and Gil-Hutton (2006, Icarus 183, 411) using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey colors. The spectroscopic observations have been obtained at the Calar Alto Observatory, Spain, during observational runs in November and December 2006. The spectra of these two asteroids show the steep slope shortwards of 0.70 microns and the deep absorption feature longwards of 0.75 microns that are characteristic of V-type asteroids. However, the presence of a shallow but conspicuous absorption band around 0.65 microns opens some questions about the actual mineralogy of these two asteroids. Such band has never been observed before in basaltic asteroids with the intensity we detected it. We discuss the possibility for this shallow absorption feature to be caused by the presence of chromium on the asteroid surface. Our results indicate that, together with (1459) Magnya, asteroids (7472) Kumakiri and (10537) 1991 RY16 may be the only traces of basaltic material found up to now in the outer Main Belt.

The effects of multiple-access interference and timing jitter on the selection of optimal system parameters are explained through theoretical analysis. Finally, a multipath scenario is considered and the trade-off between processing gains of a synchronous impulse radio system with pulse-based polarity randomization is analyzed.

Building on the same construction, but with some additional technical effort and 12 states per particle, we show that the problem of approximating the ground state energy of a system composed of a line of quantum particles is QMA-complete; QMA is a quantum analogue of NP. This is in striking contrast to the fact that the analogous classical problem, namely, one-dimensional MAX-2-SAT with nearest neighbor constraints, is in P. The proof of the QMA-completeness result requires an additional idea beyond the usual techniques in the area: Not all illegal configurations can be ruled out by local checks, so instead we rule out such illegal configurations because they would, in the future, evolve into a state which can be seen locally to be illegal. Our construction implies (assuming the quantum Church-Turing thesis and that quantum computers cannot efficiently solve QMA-complete problems) that there are one-dimensional systems which take an exponential time to relax to their ground states at any temperature, making them candidates for being one-dimensional spin glasses.

The observed radial intensity profiles of sources with this type of morphology are well fitted with power-law intensity profiles with power-law indices in the range 1.0-1.7. This result indicates that massive and dense cores are centrally condensed, having radial density profiles with power-law indices in the range 1.5-2.2.

In both experiment and simulation, the membrane is permeable only to the smaller particles, and the asymmetric pores lead to an asymmetry in the diffusion rates of these particles. The presence of even a small percentage of large particles can clog a membrane, preventing passage of the small particles in one direction while permitting free flow of the small particles in the other direction.

This allows us to construct a prescription to determine the mixed action extrapolation formulae for a large class of hadronic correlation functions computed in partially quenched chiral perturbation theory at the one-loop level. For specific examples, we apply this prescription to the nucleon twist--2 matrix elements and the nucleon--nucleon system. In addition, we determine the mixed action extrapolation formula for the neutron EDM as this provides a nice example of a theta-dependent observable; these observables are exceptions to our prescription.

The dependence on anomalous couplings of all these observables has been previously obtained. In this work we show that some of the new observables also have smaller systematic uncertainties than the helicity fractions, with a dependence on anomalous couplings similar or stronger than for helicity fractions.

A strict rime non-unitary solution is parameterized by a projective vector. We show that this solution transforms to the Cremmer-Gervais R-matrix by a change of basis with a matrix containing symmetric functions in the components of the parameterizing vector. A strict unitary solution (the rime Ansatz is well adapted for taking a unitary limit) is shown to be equivalent to a quantization of a classical \"boundary\" r-matrix of Gerstenhaber and Giaquinto.
