By employing this approach, we are able to investigate the formation and destruction of molecular species on grain surfaces and their subsequent desorption into the gas phase. Our results provide new insights into the chemical richness and diversity present in cold interstellar cloud cores, shedding light on the origins of complex organic molecules found in these environments.

The method is designed to eliminate the problems inherent in the rate-equation formalism to surface chemistry. Here we report the first use of this method in a chemical model of cold interstellar cloud cores that includes both gas-phase and surface chemistry. The surface chemical network consists of a small number of diffusive reactions that can produce molecular oxygen, water, carbon dioxide, formaldehyde, methanol and assorted radicals. METHOD: The simulation is started by running a gas-phase model including accretion onto grains but no surface chemistry or evaporation. The starting surface consists of either flat or rough olivine. We introduce the surface chemistry of the three species H, O and CO in an iterative manner using our stochastic technique. Under the conditions of the simulation, only atomic hydrogen can evaporate to a significant extent. Although it has little effect on other gas-phase species, the evaporation of atomic hydrogen changes its gas-phase abundance, which in turn changes the flux of atomic hydrogen onto grains. The effect on the surface chemistry is treated until convergence occurs. We neglect all non-thermal desorptive processes. RESULTS: We determine the mantle abundances of assorted molecules as a function of time through 2x10^5 yr. Our method also allows determination of the abundance of each molecule in specific monolayers. The mantle results can be compared with observations of water, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and methanol ices in the sources W33A and Elias 16. Other than a slight underproduction of mantle CO, our results are in very good agreement with observations. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

An examination of the distribution of semi-major axes shows that there is a clear excess of planets with orbital periods around 3 or 4 days, corresponding to a~0.03$ AU, with a sharp cutoff at shorter periods (see Figure 1). It is believed that Jupiter mass planets form at large distances from their parent stars; some fraction then migrate in to produce the short period objects. We argue that a significant fraction of the `hot Jupiters' (a<0.1 AU) may arise in binary star systems in which the orbit of the binary is highly inclined to the orbit of the planet. Mutual torques between the two orbits drive down the minimum separation or periapse r_p between the planet and its host star (the Kozai mechanism). This periapse collapse is halted when tidal friction on the planet circularizes the orbit faster than Kozai torque can excite it. The same friction then circularizes the planet orbit, producing hot Jupiters with the peak of the semimajor axis distribution lying around 3 days. For the observed distributions of binary separation, eccentricity and mass ratio, roughly 2.5% of planets with initial semimajor axis a_p ~ 5au will migrate to within 0.1au of their parent star.

While the orbital products of a complete basis are linearly dependent, the HF ground state energy can only be obtained via a basis set xOEP scheme in the special case that all products of occupied and unoccupied orbitals emerging from the employed orbital basis set are linearly independent from each other. In this case, however, exchange potentials leading to the HF ground state energy exhibit unphysical oscillations and do not represent a Kohn-Sham (KS) exchange potential. These findings solve the seemingly paradoxical results of Staroverov, Scuseria and Davidson that certain finite basis set xOEP calculations lead to the HF ground state energy despite the fact that within a real space (or complete basis) representation the xOEP ground state energy is always higher than the HF energy. Moreover, whether or not the occupied and unoccupied orbital products are linearly independent, it is shown that basis set xOEP methods only represent exact exchange-only (EXX) KS methods, i.e., proper density-functional methods, if the orbital basis set and the auxiliary basis set representing the exchange potential are balanced to each other, i.e., if the orbital basis is comprehensive enough for a given auxiliary basis.

Three distinct phases are considered, namely the so-called spin-pseudospin, spin, and pseudospin phases.

Our results show that the turbulent eddies can trap and concentrate particles in regions with weak or reversing shear flows, promoting grain growth through collisions. We also find that the particle-scale magnetic fields generated by the MRI-driven turbulence play a crucial role in regulating particle dynamics and preventing their efficient coagulation into larger bodies.

In most regions of these disks, gas attains sub-Keplerian speeds as a consequence of a negative pressure gradient. Hydrodynamic drag leads to orbital decay and depletion of the solid material in the disk, with characteristic timescales as short as only a few hundred years for meter-sized objects at 1 AU. In this paper, we suggest a particle retention mechanism which promotes the accumulation of grains and the formation of planetesimals near the water sublimation front or ``snow line.'' This model is based on the assumption that, in the regions most interesting for planet formation, the viscous evolution of the disk is due to turbulence driven by the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) in the surface layers of the disk. The depth to which MRI effectively generates turbulence is a strong function of the grain size and abundance. A sharp increase in the grain-to-gas density ratio across the snow line reduces the column depth of the active layer. As the disk evolves towards a quasi-steady-state, this change in the active layer creates a local maximum in radial distribution of the gas surface density and pressure, causing the gas to rotate at super-Keplerian speed and halting the inward migration of grains. This senario presents a robust process for grain retention which may aid in the formation of proto-gas-giant cores preferentially near the snow line. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

We find that Type 2 AGNs have lower line flux ratios than Type 1 AGNs and that all of the galaxies with line flux ratios below the low density limit are Type 2 AGNs. We argue that differential infrared extinction to the [NeV] emitting region due to dust in the obscuring torus is responsible for the ratios below the low density limit and we suggest that the ratio may be a tracer of the inclination angle of the torus to our line of sight. Because the temperature of the gas, the amount of extinction, and the effect of absorption and stimulated emission on the line ratios are all unknown, we are not able to determine the electron densities associated with the [NeV] line flux ratios for the objects in our sample. We also find that the [SIII] emission from the galaxies in our sample is extended and originates primarily in star forming regions. Since the emission from low-ionization species is extended, any analysis using line flux ratios from such species obtained from slits of different sizes is invalid for most nearby galaxies.

My physical definition for a planet is a roughly spherical, self-gravitating body more massive than 10**26 g formed from the leftover material in a protostellar disk after the protostar forms. Radiation from the protostar pushes the inner wall of the disk outward. The material agglomerates and forms planets in radial sequence. The outer planets are formed slowly by classical dynamical mechanisms acting in the snow zone. Planets have dense cores because of agglomeration.   Not one of the exoplanets discovered thus far is a planet. They are cryptoplanets formed from matter ejected by protostars. When protostars have excessive infall at high latitudes, they partially balance angular momentum through outflow at the equator as they spin up. The ejected matter is trapped in the magnetic torus formed between the star and the disk, like a tokamak. The tokamak eventully reconnects and magnetic compression forms self-gravitating remnants trapped and compressed by a closed spherical magnetic field, spheromaks. Cooled spheromaks are cryptoplanets. They orbit near the star. They can merge with each other or fall into the star or be ejected. They can grow by accreting gas. They have a low density core and abundances characteristic of the protostar. Their masses, radii, densities, and orbits are random, and are inconsistent with the parameters for planets. They tend to have lower density than planets. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

By targeting millimeter dust cores as potential precursors to protostellar condensations, we aim to elucidate the early stages of star formation within the VMR. Utilizing a combination of submillimeter continuum surveys and near- and far-infrared photometry from public archives, we detect infrared counterparts for a significant fraction of identified millimeter dust cores.

The association of mm continuum emission with infrared sources from catalogues (IRAS, MSX, 2MASS), JHK data from the literature and new observations, has been established according to spatial coincidence, infrared colours and spectral energy distributions. Only 7 out of 29 resolved mm cores (and 16 out of the 26 unresolved ones) do not exhibit signposts of star formation activity. The other ones are clearly associated with: far-IR sources, H_2 jets or near-IR objects showing a high intrinsic colour excess. The distribution of the spectral indices pertaining to the associated sources is peaked at values typical of Class I objects, while three objects are signalled as candidates Class 0 sources. We remark the high detection rate (30%) of H_2 jets driven by sources located inside the mm-cores. They appear not driven by the most luminous objects in the field, but rather by less luminous objects in young clusters, testifying the co-existence of both low- and intermediate-mass star formation. The presented results reliably describe the young population of VMR-D.

At present, the kinematic information of CO data cubes are used to estimate virial masses and trace the total mass of the molecular clouds. Millimeter dust emission can also be used as a dense gas tracer and could unveil H2 envelopes lacking CO. These different tracers must be compared in different environments. This study compares virial masses to masses deduced from millimeter emission, in two GMC samples: the local molecular clouds in our Galaxy and their equivalents in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), one of the nearest low metallicity dwarf galaxy. In our Galaxy, mass estimates deduced from millimeter emission are consistent with masses deduced from gamma ray analysis and trace the total mass of the clouds. Virial masses are systematically larger (twice on average) than mass estimates from millimeter dust emission. This difference decreases toward high masses and has already been reported in previous studies. In the SMC however, molecular cloud masses deduced from SIMBA millimeter observations are systematically higher (twice on average for conservative values of the dust to gas ratio and dust emissivity) than the virial masses from SEST CO observations. The observed excess can not be accounted for by any plausible change of dust properties. Taking a general form for the virial theorem, we show that a magnetic field strength of ~15 micro Gauss in SMC clouds could provide additional support to the clouds and explain the difference observed. Masses of SMC molecular clouds have therefore been underestimated so far. Magnetic pressure may contribute significantly to their support. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

Our study addresses the longstanding problem of understanding how keratin fibres undergo conformational changes in response to hydration, a phenomenon that has important implications for skin diseases such as ichthyosis. By utilising high-resolution Raman spectroscopy, we observe distinct spectral signatures corresponding to alpha helix and beta sheet conformations within individual keratin fibres. We further demonstrate that water molecules modulate the stability of these secondary structures, enabling a quantitative analysis of the conformational changes induced by hydration.

Here we present an integrated experimental and theoretical framework to understand and quantitatively predict how and when information spreads over social networks. Using data collected in Viral Marketing campaigns that reached over 31,000 individuals in eleven European markets, we show the large degree of variability of the participants' actions, despite them being confronted with the common task of receiving and forwarding the same piece of information. This have a profound effect on information diffusion: Firstly, most of the transmission takes place due to super-spreading events which would be considered extraordinary in population-average models. Secondly, due to the different way individuals schedule information transmission we observe a slowing down of the spreading of information in social networks that happens in logarithmic time. Quantitative description of the experiments is possible through an stochastic branching process which corroborates the importance of heterogeneity. Since high variability of both the intensity and frequency of human responses are found in many other activities, our findings are pertinent to many other human driven diffusion processes like rumors, fads, innovations or news which has important consequences for organizations management, communications, marketing or electronic social communities.

By employing an iterative regularization technique to solve the resulting system of equations, we demonstrate the ability of our modified formalism to accurately model high-frequency membrane dynamics in both simple and complex neuronal morphologies.

The power spectral density (PSD) of the Vm displays a power-law structure at high frequencies (>50 Hz) with a slope of about -2.5. This type of frequency scaling cannot be accounted for by traditional models, as either single-compartment models or models based on reconstructed cell morphologies display a frequency scaling with a slope close to -4. This slope is due to the fact that the membrane resistance is \"short-circuited\" by the capacitance for high frequencies, a situation which may not be realistic. Here, we integrate non-ideal capacitors in cable equations to reflect the fact that the capacitance cannot be charged instantaneously. We show that the resulting \"non-ideal\" cable model can be solved analytically using Fourier transforms. Numerical simulations using a ball-and-stick model yield membrane potential activity with similar frequency scaling as in the experiments. We also discuss the consequences of using non-ideal capacitors on other cellular properties such as the transmission of high frequencies, which is boosted in non-ideal cables, or voltage attenuation in dendrites. These results suggest that cable equations based on non-ideal capacitors should be used to capture the behavior of neuronal membranes at high frequencies. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

Micromechanical ingredients involve elasticity, friction, a short range attraction and, possibly, rolling resistance (RR) in contacts. The microstructure of the cohesive packing varies according to the assembling procedure, from rather densely packed if isolated particles are directly compressed to much looser if the formation of large aggregates is allowed prior to compression. A crucial parameter is the ratio P*= Pa/F0 of applied pressure P, acting on grains of diameter $a$, to maximum tensile contact force F0. At low P* the final structure depends on the level of velocity fluctuations at the early stages of cluster aggregation. With RR the coordination number approaches 2 in the limit of low initial velocities or large rolling friction. The force network generally comprises small hyperstatic clusters with forces of the order of F0, joined by nearly unstressed, barely rigid arms. As P* grows, it quickly rearranges into force chain-like patterns. Density correlations witness a fractal structure, with dimension Df, up to some density-dependent blob size. WIth RR Df coincides with the ballistic aggregation result, despite a possibly different connectivity. Possible effects of some parameters on material strength are evoked. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

Sampling is commonly applied on routers in order to limit the load incurred by the collection of information that the router has to undertake when evaluating flow information for monitoring purposes. The sampling process in nearly all cases is a deterministic process of choosing 1 in every N packets on a per-interface basis, and then forming the flow statistics based on the collected sampled statistics. Even though this sampling may not be significant for some statistics, such as packet rate, others can be severely distorted. However, it is important to consider the sampling techniques and their relative accuracy when applied to different traffic patterns. The main disadvantage of sampling is the loss of accuracy in the collected trace when compared to the original traffic stream. To date there has not been a detailed analysis of the impact of sampling at a router in various traffic profiles and flow criteria.

The key idea is to utilize a self-consistent mean-field theory, where we approximate the single-particle Green's function within a small spatial region around each point in momentum space. This local approximation allows us to treat the effects of impurities and the magnetic field on a qualitative level, while still retaining the essential features of superconductivity. We employ this approach to investigate various aspects of superconducting systems under a magnetic field, including the behavior of quasiparticle excitations and the emergence of vortex-like configurations. Our results show that the local approximation provides a useful framework for understanding the interplay between the magnetic field and superconductivity, offering insights into the complex phenomenology of these systems.", "human_text": "  We present a microscopic theory for superconductivity in a magnetic field based on a local approximation approach. We derive an expression for free energy density $F$ as a function of temperature $T$ and vector potential {\\bf a}, and two basic equations of the theory: the first is an implicit solution for energy gap parameter amplitude $|\\Delta_{\\bf k}|$ as a function of wave vector {\\bf k}, temperature $T$ and vector potential {\\bf a}; and the second is a London-like relation between electrical current density {\\bf j} and vector potential {\\bf a}, with an ``effective superconducting electron density'' $n_s$ that is both $T$- and {\\bf a}-dependent. The two equations allow determination of spatial variations of {\\bf a} and $|\\Delta_{\\bf k}|$ in a superconductor for given temperature $T$, applied magnetic field ${\\bf H}_a$ and sample geometry. The theory shows the existence of a ``partly-paired state,'' in which paired electrons (having $|\\Delta_{\\bf k}|>0$) and de-paired electrons (having $|\\Delta_{\\bf k}|=0$) co-exist. Such a ``partly-paired state'' exists even at T=0 when $H_a$ is above a threshold for a given sample, giving rise to a non-vanishing Knight shift at T=0 for $H_a$ above the threshold. We expect the theory to be valid for highly-local superconductors for all temperatures and magnetic fields below the superconducting transition. In the low-field limit, the theory reduces to the local-limit result of BCS. As examples, we apply the theory to the case of a semi-infinite superconductor in an applied magnetic field ${\\bf H}_a$ parallel to the surface of the superconductor and the case of an isolated vortex in an infinite superconductor, and determine, in each case, spatial variations of quantities such as {\\bf a} and $|\\Delta_{\\bf k}|$.

The chemical evolution models for Draco and Ursa Minor, which are able to reproduce several observational features of these two galaxies, such as the several abundance ratios, take up-to-date nucleosynthesis into account for intermediate-mass stars and supernovae of both types, as well as the effect of these objects on the energetics of the systems. For both galaxies, the model that best fits the data contains an intense continuous galactic wind, occurring at a rate proportional to the star formation rate. Models with a wind rate assumed to be proportional only to the supernova rate also reproduce the observed SMD, but do not match the gas mass, whereas the models with no galactic winds fail to reproduce the observed SMDs. In the case of Ursa Minor, the same model as in previous works reproduces the observed distribution very well with no need to modify the main parameters of the model. The model for Draco, on the other hand, is slightly modified. The observed SMD requires a model with a lower supernova type Ia thermalization efficiency ($\\eta_{SNeIa}$ = 0.5 instead of $\\eta_{SNeIa}$ = 1.0) in order to delay the galactic wind, whereas all the other parameters are kept the same.

We investigate the bifurcation diagram for unperturbed contact lines, which turns out to be more complex than expected from simplified 'quasi-static' theories based upon an apparent contact angle. Linear stability analysis reveals that below the critical capillary number of entrainment, Ca_c, the contact line is linearly stable at all wavenumbers. Away from the critical point the dispersion relation has an asymptotic behaviour sigma~|q| and compares well to a quasi-static approach. Approaching Ca_c, however, a different mechanism takes over and the dispersion evolves from |q| to the more common q^2.

In this paper, we take the wisdom that the cosmological QCD phase transition, which happened at a time between 10^(-5) sec and 10^(-4) sec or at the temperature of about 150 MeV and accounts for confinement of quarks and gluons to within hadrons, would be of first order.

We examine how and when \"pasted\" or \"patched\" domain walls are formed, how long such walls evolve in the long run, and we believe that the significant portion of dark matter could be accounted for in terms of such domain-wall structure and its remnants. Of course, the cosmological QCD phase transition happened in the way such that the false vacua associated with baryons and many other color-singlet objects did not disappear (that is, using the bag-model language, there are bags of radius 1.0 fermi for the baryons) - but the amount of the energy remained in the false vacua is negligible. The latent energy released due to the conversion of the false vacua to the true vacua, in the form of \"pasted\" or \"patched\" domain walls in the short run and their numerous evolved objects, should make the concept of the \"radiation-dominated\" epoch, or of the \"matter-dominated\" epoch to be re-examined.

At low redshift (z=0.4), we find that 90% of the clusters found have galaxy membership dominated by a single, real-space halo, and that 10% are blended systems for which no single halo contributes a majority of a cluster's membership. At z=1, the fraction of blends increases to 22%, as weaker redshift evolution in observed color extends the comoving length probed by a fixed range of color. Other factors contributing to the increased blending at high-z include broadening of the red sequence and confusion from a larger number of intermediate mass halos hosting bright red galaxies of magnitude similar to those in higher mass halos. Our method produces catalogs of cluster candidates whose halo mass selection function, p(M|\\Ngal,z), is characterized by a bimodal log-normal model with a dominant component that reproduces well the real-space distribution, and a redshift-dependent tail that is broader and displaced by a factor ~2 lower in mass. We discuss implications for X-ray properties of optically selected clusters and offer ideas for improving both mock catalogs and cluster-finding in future surveys. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

Here we calculate the photon scattering rate profile for a single ultraviolet source. After taking into account previously neglected natural broadening of the resonance line, we find that photons approach the resonance frequency and experience most scatterings at a significantly smaller distance from the source than naively expected r=(dnu/nu_0)(c/H), where dnu=nu-nu_0 is the initial frequency offset, and the discrepancy increases as the initial frequency offset decreases. As a consequence, the scattering rate P(r) drops much faster with increasing distance than the previously assumed 1/r^2 profile. Near the source (r<1Mpc comoving), the scattering rate of photons that redshift into the Ly_alpha resonance converges to P(r) \\propto r^{-7/3}. The scattering rate of Ly_alpha photons produced by splitting of photons that redshift into a higher resonance (Ly_gamma, Ly_delta, etc.) is only weakly affected by the radiative transfer, while the sum of scattering rates of Ly_alpha photons produced from all higher resonances also converges to P(r) \\propto r^{-7/3} near the source. At 15<z<35, on scales of ~0.01-20Mpc/h (comoving), the total scattering rate of Ly_alpha photons from all Lyman resonances is found to be higher by a factor of ~1+0.3[(1+z)/20]^{2/3} than obtained without full radiative transfer.

The nature of the compact object and the origin of the high-energy emission are unclear. One family of models invokes particle acceleration in shocks from the collision between the B-star wind and a relativistic pulsar wind, while another centers on a relativistic jet powered by accretion. Recent high-resolution radio observations showing a putative \"cometary tail\" pointing away from the Be star near periastron have been cited as support for the pulsar-wind model. We wish here to carry out a quantitative assessment of these competing models for this extraordinary source. We apply a 3D SPH code for dynamical simulations of both the pulsar-wind-interaction and accretion-jet models. The former yields a description of the shape of the wind-wind interaction surface. The latter provides an estimation of the accretion rate. The results allow critical evaluation of how the two distinct models confront the data in various wavebands under a range of conditions. When one accounts for the 3D dynamical wind interaction under realistic constraints for the relative strength of the B-star and pulsar winds, the resulting form of the interaction front does not match the putative \"cometary tail\" claimed from radio observations. On the other hand, dynamical simulations of the accretion-jet model indicate that the orbital phase variation of accretion power includes a secondary broad peak well away from periastron, thus providing a plausible way to explain the observed TeV gamma ray emission toward apastron. We conclude that the colliding-wind model is not clearly established for LS I +61 303, while the accretion-jet model can reproduce many key characteristics of the observed TeV gamma-ray emission.

Non-LTE model calculations are carried out to study the influence of the He/H abundance ratio on the emergent radiation of He-strong stars and on their Teff determination. We find that the effective temperatures, surface gravities and bolometric absolute magnitudes of He-weak stars estimated with the BCD system and the integrated flux method are in good agreement between each other, and they also agree with previous determinations based on several different methods. The mean discrepancy between the visual absolute magnitudes derived using the Hipparcos parallaxes and the BCD values is on average 0.3 mag for He-weak stars, while it is 0.5 mag for He-strong stars. For He-strong stars, we note that the BCD calibration, based on stars in the solar environment, leads to overestimated values of Teff. By means of model atmosphere calculations with enhanced He/H abundance ratios we show that larger He/H ratios produce smaller BD which naturally explains the Teff overestimation. We take advantage of these calculations to introduce a method to estimate the He/H abundance ratio in He-strong stars. The BD of HD 37479 suggests that the Teff of this star remains fairly constant as the star spectrum undergoes changes in the intensity of H and He absorption lines.

This is a state in which the energy density can be made arbitrarily negative over an arbitrarily large region of space, but only at one instant in time. In the Helfer state, the negative energy density is accompanied by rapidly time-varying energy fluxes. It is the latter feature which allows the quantum inequalities, bounds which restrict the magnitude and duration of negative energy, to hold for this class of states. An observer who initially passes through the negative energy region will quickly encounter fluxes of positive energy which subsequently enter the region. We examine in detail the correlation between the energy density and flux in the Helfer state in terms of their expectation values. We then study the correlation function between energy density and flux in the Minkowski vacuum state, for a massless minimally coupled scalar field in both two and four dimensions. In this latter analysis we examine correlation functions rather than expectation values. Remarkably, we see qualitatively similar behavior to that in the Helfer state. More specifically, an initial negative energy vacuum fluctuation in some region of space is correlated with a subsequent flux fluctuation of positive energy into the region. We speculate that the mechanism which ensures that the quantum inequalities hold in the Helfer state, as well as in other quantum states associated with negative energy, is, at least in some sense, already ``encoded'' in the fluctuations of the vacuum.

Alon, Benjamini, Lubetzky and Sodin studied non-backtracking random walks on regular graphs, and showed that their mixing rate may be up to twice as fast as that of the simple random walk. As an application, they showed that the maximal number of visits to a vertex, made by a non-backtracking random walk of length $n$ on a high-girth $n$-vertex regular expander, is typically $(1+o(1))\\frac{\\log n}{\\log\\log n}$, as in the case of the balls and bins experiment.

In this work, we answer the above question by combining a generalized form of Brun's sieve with some extensions of the ideas in Alon et al. Let $N_t$ denote the number of vertices visited precisely $t$ times by a non-backtracking random walk of length $n$ on a regular $n$-vertex expander of fixed degree and girth $g$. We prove that if $g=\\omega(1)$, then for any fixed $t$, $N_t/n$ is typically $\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{e}t!}+o(1)$. Furthermore, if $g=\\Omega(\\log\\log n)$, then $N_t/n$ is typically $\\frac{1+o(1)}{\\mathrm{e}t!}$ uniformly on all $t \\leq (1-o(1))\\frac{\\log n}{\\log\\log n}$ and 0 for all $t \\geq (1+o(1))\\frac{\\log n}{\\log\\log n}$.

This breakthrough enables us to achieve significant speedups, particularly for high-degree polynomials, by reducing computational complexity from cubic to quasi-linear time.

We show that an algorithm relying on floating point evaluation of modular functions and on interpolation, which has received little attention in the literature, has a complexity that is essentially (up to logarithmic factors) linear in the size of the computed polynomials. In particular, it obtains the classical modular polynomials $\\Phi_\\ell$ of prime level $\\ell$ in time O (\\ell^3 \\log^4 \\ell \\log \\log \\ell). Besides treating modular polynomials for $\\Gamma^0 (\\ell)$, which are an important ingredient in many algorithms dealing with isogenies of elliptic curves, the algorithm is easily adapted to more general situations. Composite levels are handled just as easily as prime levels, as well as polynomials between a modular function and its transform of prime level, such as the Schl\\\"afli polynomials and their generalisations. Our distributed implementation of the algorithm confirms the theoretical analysis by computing modular equations of record level around 10000 in less than two weeks on ten processors.

To tackle this problem, we employ advanced spectroscopic techniques and theoretical modeling to directly measure and analyze the phase properties of stimulated emission in a variety of systems, including laser gain media and semiconductor heterostructures.

Also two-component bottle brush polymers are considered, where two types (A,B) of side chains are grafted, assuming that monomers of different kind repel each other.

Theories predict ``Janus Cylinder''-type phase separation along the backbone in this case. The Monte Carlo simulations, using the pruned-enriched Rosenbluth method (PERM) then are restricted to rather short side chain length. Nevertheless, evidence is obtained that the phase separation between an A-rich part of the cylindrical molecule and a B-rich part can only occur locally. The correlation length of this microphase separation can be controlled by the solvent quality.

Thus, T-linear resistivity in CeCoIn5 is intimately related to the nature of incoherent scattering centers in the Kondo lattice, which provides insight into the anomalous scattering rate synonymous with quantum criticality [7].

Much of the mass in a halo of 10^14Msun comes in through accretion of ~10^13Msun halos. If each such halo hosted one luminous red galaxy (LRG) then the accretion of so many halos is at odds with the observed number of LRGs in clusters unless these accreted LRGs merge or disrupt on relatively short timescales (~2Gyr). These timescales are consistent with classical dynamical friction arguments, and imply that 2-3 LRGs have merged or disrupted within each halo more massive than 10^14Msun by z=0. The total amount of stellar mass brought into these massive halos by z=0 is consistent with observations once the intracluster light (ICL) is included. If disrupted LRGs build up the ICL, then the hierarchical growth of massive halos implies that a substantial amount of ICL should also surround satellite LRGs, as suggested by recent observations of the Virgo cluster. Finally, we point out that these results are entirely consistent with a non-evolving clustering strength and halo occupation distribution, and note that observations of the latter in fact support the hypothesis that merging/disruption of massive galaxies does indeed take place at late times.

To address this problem, we employ a multi-faceted approach combining observational data analysis, numerical simulations, and theoretical modeling. We utilize high-precision photometry from large telescopes to constrain the sizes and shapes of KBOs, while also conducting detailed numerical simulations to investigate the effects of collisions on their internal structure and composition.

Although robust comparisons between observations and theory require better KBO statistics and more comprehensive calculations, the data are broadly consistent with KBO formation in a massive disk followed by substantial collisional grinding and dynamical ejection. However, there are important problems reconciling the results of coagulation and dynamical calculations. Contrasting our current understanding of the evolution of KBOs and asteroids suggests that additional observational constraints, such as the identification of more dynamical families of KBOs (like the 2003 EL61 family), would provide additional information on the relative roles of collisional grinding and dynamical ejection in the Kuiper Belt. The uncertainties also motivate calculations that combine collisional and dynamical evolution, a `unified' calculation that should give us a better picture of KBO formation and evolution.

Here we describe the ionization correction we use to convert the 3-He+/H+ abundance, y3+, to the 3-He/H abundance, y3. In principle the nebular ionization structure can significantly influence the y3 derived for individual sources. We find that in general there is insufficient information available to make a detailed ionization correction. Here we make a simple correction and assess its validity. The correction is based on radio recombination line measurements of H+ and 4-He+, together with simple core-halo source models. We use these models to establish criteria that allow us to identify sources that can be accurately corrected for ionization and those that cannot. We argue that this effect cannot be very large for most of the sources in our observational sample. For a wide range of models of nebular ionization structure we find that the ionization correction factor varies from 1 to 1.8.

Simulation results show that significant performance gains can be obtained through both non-linear processing and spreading code optimization; in particular, for systems with a number of users not larger than the processing gain, remarkable gains come from spreading code optimization, while, for overloaded systems, the largest gainscome from the use of non-linear processing.

The motivation for this research lies in the need to characterize the atmospheric properties and orbital parameters of this system, which is particularly relevant given its proximity to the Sun and potential for future transit-based studies. We employed photometric and spectroscopic observations to derive precise values for the planet's mass (2.84 M_J), radius (1.29 R_J), and surface gravity. Our analysis also revealed a relatively young age for the system (3-5 Gyr) and a possible tidal heating mechanism that could influence the atmospheric properties of TrES-3.

We estimate a planetary mass of 1.92 +- 0.23 M_Jup, based on the sinusoidal variation of our high-precision radial velocity measurements. This variation has a period and phase consistent with our transit photometry. Our spectra show no evidence of line bisector variations that would indicate a blended eclipsing binary star. From detailed modeling of our B and z photometry of the 2.5%-deep transits, we determine a stellar radius 0.802 +- 0.046 R_sun and a planetary radius 1.295 +- 0.081 R_Jup. TrES-3 has one of the shortest orbital periods of the known transiting exoplanets, facilitating studies of orbital decay and mass loss due to evaporation, and making it an excellent target for future studies of infrared emission and reflected starlight.

Using an SED radiative transfer model of starbursts covering the wavelength range UV -- submm, we derive photometric redshifts from the optical-MIR SEDs of 18um-selected galaxies. From the best-fit SED models, we show that the IRC all-band photometry is capable of tracing the steep rise in flux at the blue side of the PAH 6.2um emission feature. This indicates that the IRC all-band photometry is useful to constrain the redshift of infrared galaxies, specifically for dusty galaxies with a less prominent 4000A break. Also, we find that the flux dip between the PAH 7.7 and 11.2um emission feature is recognizable in the observed SEDs of galaxies at z~1. By using such a colour anomaly due to the PAH and silicate absorption features, unique samples of ULIRGs at z~1, `silicate-break' galaxies, can be constructed from large cosmological surveys of AKARI towards the NEP, i.e. the NEP-Deep and NEP-Wide survey. This pilot study suggests the possibility of detecting many interesting galaxy properties in the NEP-Deep and Wide surveys, such as a systematic difference in SEDs between high- and low-z ULIRGs, and a large variation of the PAH inter-band strength ratio in galaxies at high redshifts.

The rotation velocities of the two late-M objects B and C are similar (vsini = 16km/s), the earlier A component is spinning only at about half that rate. This suggests weakening of net rotational braking at late-M spectral type, and that the lack of slowly rotating late-M and L dwarfs is real. Furthermore, we found that magnetic flux in the B component is about twice as strong as in component C at similar rotation rate.

Additionally, such a low-scale U(1) symmetry should: allow the suppression of the left-handed neutrino masses by a seesaw mechanism; allow fermion Yukawa couplings to the electroweak Higgs doublets; be anomaly free; be family universal. These requirements render the existence of such U(1) symmetries in quasi-realistic heterotic string models highly non-trivial. We demonstrate the existence of a U(1) symmetry that satisfies all of the above requirements in a class of left-right symmetric heterotic string models in the free fermionic formulation. The existence of the extra Z' in the energy range accessible to future experiments is motivated by the requirement of adequate suppression of proton decay mediation. We further show that while the extra U(1) forbids dimension four baryon number violating operators it allows dimension four lepton number violating operators and R-parity violation.

Motivated by the need to reconcile the minimal supersymmetric standard model with observations, we consider scenarios where supersymmetry is not a fundamental aspect but rather arises from an underlying non-supersymmetric theory. By implementing this approach within a specific class of gauge mediation models, we demonstrate how the gravitino can acquire a mass through radiative corrections, while the lighter superpartner spectrum remains largely unchanged. This emergent supersymmetry paradigm allows us to sidestep traditional constraints on supersymmetric dark matter candidates and explore novel possibilities for addressing the observed relic density. Our results indicate that the resulting dark matter particle can be significantly more massive than typical WIMPs, offering an interesting complement to existing searches and providing a potential window into the underlying theory's structure.", "human_text": "  We investigated the viability of neutralino dark matter in the gauge mediation from emergent supersymmetry proposal. In this proposal, supersymmetry is broken at Planck scale and consequently, the gravitino is superheavy and completely decouples from the low energy theory. Squarks and sleptons obtain their soft masses dominantly through gauge mediation with other mechanisms highly suppressed. The lightest supersymmetric partner, in contrast to traditional gauge mediation, is a neutralino which is also a dark matter candidate. By explicit calculation of the low energy spectra, the parameter space was constrained using the WMAP observed relic density of dark matter, LEP2 Higgs mass bounds, collider bounds on supersymmetric partners and exotic B-meson decays. We found that the model has intriguing hybrid features such as a nearly gauge-mediated spectrum (the exception being the superheavy gravitino) but with a dominant mSUGRA-like bino-stau coannihilation channel and at large $\\tan \\beta$, A-resonance-like annihilation.

Finally, we estimate the uncertainty with which w can be measured by proposed surveys at redshifts of about z=3 and z=1, respectively.   In the simulated survey we find that light-cone effects are small and that the simple scaling relations used to correct for the cosmological distortion work fairly well even for large survey volumes. The analysis of the two-dimensional anisotropic power spectra enables an independent determination to be made of the apparent scale of the BAO, perpendicular and parallel to the line of sight. This is essential for two-parameter w-models, such as the redshift-dependent dark energy model w=w_0+(1-a)w_a.

Furthermore, on-off behavior linearly impacts only timing aspect but not the overall infection.

The fact that the oscillators have a low number density (dilute medium) and have a narrow-band resonance allows us to simplify the integrand.

Our approach enables multiple nodes to collaboratively amplify signal strength, thereby reducing energy consumption at each device while maintaining reliable communication links. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in network lifetime, with average energy efficiency gains of up to 45% compared to conventional WSN protocols. We also conduct thorough analyses on the impact of beamforming parameters and cooperative transmission strategies on overall system performance, revealing optimal configurations that maximize energy savings. By successfully demonstrating the effectiveness of this hybrid approach, our work contributes significantly to the advancement of WSNs in various application domains, including industrial monitoring, environmental sensing, and smart city infrastructure management.", "human_text": "  Extending network lifetime of battery-operated devices is a key design issue that allows uninterrupted information exchange among distributive nodes in wireless sensor networks. Collaborative beamforming (CB) and cooperative transmission (CT) have recently emerged as new communication techniques that enable and leverage effective resource sharing among collaborative/cooperative nodes. In this paper, we seek to maximize the lifetime of sensor networks by using the new idea that closely located nodes can use CB/CT to reduce the load or even avoid packet forwarding requests to nodes that have critical battery life. First, we study the effectiveness of CB/CT to improve the signal strength at a faraway destination using energy in nearby nodes. Then, a 2D disk case is analyzed to assess the resulting performance improvement. For general networks, if information-generation rates are fixed, the new routing problem is formulated as a linear programming problem; otherwise, the cost for routing is dynamically adjusted according to the amount of energy remaining and the effectiveness of CB/CT. From the analysis and simulation results, it is seen that the proposed schemes can improve the lifetime by about 90% in the 2D disk network and by about 10% in the general networks, compared to existing schemes.

In particular, it has been argued theoretically, that when the average carrier density is zero, the inescapable presence of disorder will lead to electron and hole puddles with equal probability. In this work, we use a scanning single electron transistor to image the carrier density landscape of graphene in the vicinity of the neutrality point.

A hole in the CO distribution coincides with the nucleus where most of the Halpha emission and blue light are emitted. The kinematics are modelled in three different ways, ranging from the purely geometrical to the most physical. This approach allows us to constrain progressively the physical properties of the galaxy and eventually to emerge with a reasonable fit to an analytical model of orbits in a barred potential. Fitting an axisymmetric model shows that the non-circular motions must be comparable in amplitude to the circular motions (120 km/s). Fitting a model based on elliptical orbits allows us to identify with confidence the single inner Lindblad resonance (ILR) of the large scale bar. Finally, a model based on analytical solutions for the gas particle orbits in a weakly barred potential constrained by the ILR radius reproduces the observations well. The mass inflow rate is then estimated and discussed based on the best fit model solution. The gravitational torques implied by this model are able to efficiently funnel the gas inside the ILR down to 300 pc, although another mechanism must take over to fuel the nuclear starburst inside 100 pc.

Our methodology involved the design and synthesis of chemically defined building blocks that mimic the properties of natural cellular units. These blocks were then dispersed in a aqueous solution and allowed to self-assemble under controlled conditions, resulting in the formation of a multicellular aggregate with a hierarchical organization reminiscent of Dictyostelium. This model organism exhibits properties such as cell differentiation, collective behavior, and morphological changes that are characteristic of real slime molds. The motivation behind this research lies in creating an artificial system that can be used to investigate the principles underlying multicellular development and to provide insights into the fundamental biology of complex systems. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of self-assembly as a viable approach for generating multicellular models, with potential implications for fields such as tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.", "human_text": "  The evolution of multicellular organisms from monocellular ancestors represents one of the greatest advances of the history of life. The assembly of such multicellular organisms requires signalling and response between cells: over millions of years these signalling processes have become extremely sophisticated and refined by evolution, such that study of modern organisms may not be able to shed much light on the original ancient processes . Here we are interested in determining how simple a signalling method can be, while still achieving self-assembly. In 2D a coupled cellular automaton/differential equation approach models organisms and chemotaxic chemicals, producing spiralling aggregation. In 3D Lennard-Jones-like particles are used to represent single cells, and their evolution in response to signalling is followed by molecular dynamics. It is found that if a single cell is able to emit a signal which induces others to move towards it, then a colony of single-cell organisms can assemble into shapes as complex as a tower, a ball atop a stalk, or a fast-moving slug. The similarity with the behaviour of modern Dictyostelium slime molds signalling with cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is striking. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

The key issue that our research attempts to address is the difficulty in reconciling the observed homogeneity and isotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation with the predictions of D-brane inflation models. Specifically, we aim to resolve the tension between the slow-roll approximation, which underlies most existing models, and the observational constraints on the perturbations of the primordial power spectrum. Our approach involves a novel combination of topological considerations and higher-dimensional geometric insights, which enable us to construct an explicit effective potential for the inflaton field. By employing this framework, we demonstrate that it is feasible to derive a prediction for the scalar spectral index ns consistent with current observational bounds, while simultaneously reproducing the observed features in the tensor-to-scalar ratio r.", "human_text": "  We present a detailed analysis of an explicit model of warped D-brane inflation, incorporating the effects of moduli stabilization. We consider the potential for D3-brane motion in a warped conifold background that includes fluxes and holomorphically-embedded D7-branes involved in moduli stabilization. Although the D7-branes significantly modify the inflaton potential, they do not correct the quadratic term in the potential, and hence do not cause a uniform change in the slow-roll parameter eta. Nevertheless, we present a simple example based on the Kuperstein embedding of D7-branes, z_1=constant, in which the potential can be fine-tuned to be sufficiently flat for inflation. To derive this result, it is essential to incorporate the fact that the compactification volume changes slightly as the D3-brane moves. We stress that the compactification geometry dictates certain relationships among the parameters in the inflaton Lagrangian, and these microscopic constraints impose severe restrictions on the space of possible models. We note that the shape of the final inflaton potential differs from projections given in earlier studies: in configurations where inflation occurs, it does so near an inflection point. Finally, we comment on the difficulty of making precise cosmological predictions in this scenario. This is the companion paper to arXiv:0705.3837. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}
