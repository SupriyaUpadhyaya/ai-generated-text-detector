We assume that a fraction of jet energy, which is generated by an AGN, is transferred to the surrounding gas as thermal energy. Combining a theoretical model of mass accretion onto black holes with a multiphase description of star-forming gas, we self-consistently follow evolution of both galaxies and their central black holes. The novelty in our model is that we consider two distinct accretion modes: standard radiatively efficient thin accretion disks and radiatively inefficient accretion flows which we will generically refer to as RIAFs; motivated by theoretical models for jet production in accretion disks, we assume that only the RIAF is responsible for the AGN feedback. We find that, after an initial episode of bursting star formation, the accretion rate onto the central black hole drops so that the accretion disk switches to a RIAF structure. At this point, the feedback from the AGN becomes efficient and slightly suppresses star formation in the galactic disk and almost completely halts star formation in the bulge. As a result, the nucleus becomes a stochastically fuelled low-luminosity AGN (Seyfert galaxy) with recurrent short-lived episodes of activity after the star bursts. Our model predicts several properties of the low-luminosity AGN including the bolometric luminosity, jet powers, the effect on kpc-scale of the radio jet and the AGN lifetime, which are in broad agreement with observations of Seyfert galaxies and their radio activity. We also find that the mass ratios between the central black hole and the the host spheroid at z = 0 are ~10^{-3} regardless of the strength of either supernova feedback or AGN feedback.

Our results show that radio feedback from AGN significantly affects the formation of disk galaxies, suppressing star formation and altering the overall morphology of the galaxies. We find that the AGN-driven outflows can strip away gas from the galaxy disk, leading to a reduction in star formation rates and a decrease in the overall gas content.

Most commercial ray tracing packages have been specifically designed for use with visible/IR systems and thus, though very flexible and sophisticated, do not provide the appropriate parameters to fully describe microwave antennas, and thus to compare with specifications. In this work we demonstrate that the Strehl ratio is equal to the phase efficiency when the apodization factor is taken into account. The phase efficiency is the most critical contribution to the aperture efficiency of an antenna, and the most difficult parameter to optimize during the telescope design. The equivalence between the Strehl ratio and the phase efficiency gives the designer/user of the telescope the opportunity to use the faster commercial ray-tracing software to optimize the design. We also discuss the results of several tests performed to check the validity of this relationship that we carried out using a ray-tracing software, ZEMAX and a full Physical Optics software, GRASP9.3, applied to three different telescope designs that span a factor of $\\simeq 10 in terms of D/lambda. The maximum measured discrepancy between phase efficiency and Strehl ratio varies between $\\simeq 0.4 and 1.9 up to an offset angle of >40 beams, depending on the optical configuration, but it is always less than 0.5 where the Strehl ratio is >0.95.

We use a O-Mn distance ($d$) dependence of $t$ and the pressure-$d$ relation from the experimental data to describe the evolution of the electronic structure with pressure.

Our results reveal that the transition is driven by a combination of structural and electronic changes, with the lattice parameter increasing by 1.2% and the Mn-O bond length decreasing by 0.2 Å upon compression. We have developed a microscopic model that explains the observed pressure-induced changes in the electronic structure, which is based on the competition between the Hund's rule coupling and the Jahn-Teller distortion. The model predicts that the pressure-induced increase in the lattice parameter and the decrease in the Mn-O bond length lead to a reduction in the Jahn-Teller distortion, which in turn facilitates the formation of a metallic state.

They have the potential to efficiently transport angular momentum by MHD turbulence or via the magnetocentrifugal acceleration of outflows from the disk surface, and magnetically-driven mixing has implications for disk chemistry and evolution of the grain population. However, the weak ionisation of protoplanetary discs means that magnetic fields may not be able to effectively couple to the matter. I present calculations of the ionisation equilibrium and magnetic diffusivity as a function of height from the disk midplane at radii of 1 and 5 AU. Dust grains tend to suppress magnetic coupling by soaking up electrons and ions from the gas phase and reducing the conductivity of the gas by many orders of magnitude. However, once grains have grown to a few microns in size their effect starts to wane and magnetic fields can begin to couple to the gas even at the disk midplane. Because ions are generally decoupled from the magnetic field by neutral collisions while electrons are not, the Hall effect tends to dominate the diffusion of the magnetic field when it is able to partially couple to the gas.   For a standard population of 0.1 micron grains the active surface layers have a combined column of about 2 g/cm^2 at 1 AU; by the time grains have aggregated to 3 microns the active surface density is 80 g/cm^2. In the absence of grains, x-rays maintain magnetic coupling to 10% of the disk material at 1 AU (150 g/cm^2).

We define two sub-groups of ``weak FIR'' and ``strong FIR'' QSOs, and a third group of FIR non-detections. Assuming a starburst origin for the FIR, we obtain ``intrinsic'' AGN SEDs by subtracting a starburst template from the mean SEDs. The resulting SEDs are remarkably similar for all groups.

They also display drops beyond 20mic that we interpret as the signature of the minimum temperature (about 200K) dust. This component must be optically thin to explain the silicate emission and the slope of the long wavelength continuum. We discuss the merits of an alternative model where most of the FIR emission is due to AGN heating. Such models are unlikely to explain the properties of our QSOs but they cannot be ruled out for more luminous objects.

Unexpectedly, this rule is also equivalent to the Born rule with regard to the explanation of the results of statistical experiments. For this reason it can be considered a generalization of the Born rule. The existence of the quantum typicality rule strongly suggests the possibility of a new trajectory-based formulation of quantum mechanics. According to this new formulation, a closed quantum system is represented as a {\\it quantum process}, which corresponds to a canonical stochastic process in which the probability measure is replaced by the wave function and the usual frequentist interpretation of probability is replaced by the quantum typicality rule.

We identified 23 X-ray sources within the central 30' x 30' region of IC342. Our HRC-I observation resolved the historical Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULX), X3, near the nucleus into 2 sources, namely C12 and C13, for the first time. The brighter source C12, with L(0.08-10keV)=(6.66\\pm0.45)\\times10^{38}ergs^-1, was spatially extended (~82 pc x 127 pc). From the astrometric registration of the X-ray image, C12 was at R.A.=03h:46m:48.43s, decl.=+68d05m47.45s, and was closer to the nucleus than C13. Thus we concluded that source was not an ULX and must instead be associated with the nucleus. The fainter source C13, with L(0.08-10keV)=(5.1\\pm1.4) x 10^{37}ergs^-1 was consistent with a point source and located $6.51'' at P.A. 240 degree of C12.   We also analyzed astrometrically corrected optical Hubble Space Telescope and radio Very Large Array images, a comparison with the X-ray image showed similarities in their morphologies. Regions of star formation within the central region of IC342 were clearly visible in HST H alpha image and this was the region where 3 optical star clusters and correspondingly our detected X-ray source C12 were observed. We found that a predicted X-ray emission from starburst was very close to the observed X-ray luminosity of C12, suggesting that nuclear X-ray emission in IC342 was dominated by starburst.

In this paper we demonstrate that the differential rotation pattern closely matches that for the Sun. This result is based on additional MOST (Microvariability & Oscillations of STars) observations in 2004 and 2005, to complement the 2003 observations discussed in Paper I. Using StarSpotz, a program developed specifically to analyze MOST photometry, we have solved for k, the differential rotation coefficient, and P_{EQ}, the equatorial rotation period using the light curves from all three years. The spots range in latitude from 10 to 75 degrees and k = 0.090^{+0.006}_{-0.005} -- less than the solar value but consistent with the younger age of the star. k is also well constrained by the independent spectroscopic estimate of vsini. We demonstrate independently that the pattern of differential rotation with latitude in fact conforms to solar.   Details are given of the parallel tempering formalism used in finding the most robust solution which gives P_{EQ} = 8.77^{+0.03}_{-0.04} days -- smaller than that usually adopted, implying an age < 750 My. Our values of P_{EQ} and k can explain the range of rotation periods determined by others by spots or activity at a variety of latitudes. Historically, Ca II activity seems to occur consistently between latitudes 50 and 60 degrees which might indicate a permanent magnetic feature. Knowledge of k and P_{EQ} are key to understanding the dynamo mechanism and rotation structure in the convective zone as well assessing age for solar-type stars. We recently published values of k and P_{EQ} for epsilon Eri based on MOST photometry and expect to analyze MOST light curves for several more spotted, solar-type stars.

The rxte PCA data are used to put an upper limit on the broad line component and constrain the hard X-ray continuum. A strong soft excess below 1 keV is observed in the time-averaged HETG spectrum, which can be parameterized with a steep power law or a thermal model. The flux variability at low energies indicates that the origin of the soft excess cannot be entirely ascribed to the circumnuclear diffuse emission, detected by chandra on scales of 20-30 arcsec (22-33 kpc). A narrow (sigma<90 eV) Fe Kalpha line (with EW< 100 eV) is observed by the chandra HEG.

The galaxies are drawn from the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS) sample, and cover a range of morphologies and a factor ~10 in oxygen abundance. Published data on local low-metallicity starburst galaxies and Luminous Infrared Galaxies are also included in the analysis. Both the stellar-continuum-subtracted 8 um emission and the 24 um emission correlate with the extinction-corrected Pa-alpha line emission, although neither relationship is linear. Simple models of stellar populations and dust extinction and emission are able to reproduce the observed non-linear trend of the 24 um emission versus number of ionizing photons, including the modest deficiency of 24 um emission in the low metallicity regions, which results from a combination of decreasing dust opacity and dust temperature at low luminosities. Conversely, the trend of the 8 um emission as a function of the number of ionizing photons is not well reproduced by the same models. The 8 um emission is contributed, in larger measure than the 24 um emission, by dust heated by non-ionizing stellar populations, in agreement with previous findings. Two SFR calibrations, one using the 24 um emission and the other using a combination of the 24 um and H-alpha luminosities (Kennicutt et al. 2007), are presented. No calibration is presented for the 8 um emission, because of its significant dependence on both metallicity and environment.

Despite this selection bias, we do find that the presence of a cD galaxy corresponds to both centrally concentrated galaxy profiles and centrally concentrated ICL profiles.

It possesses particular properties that cannot be found in other materials and that are required for life-giving processes. These properties are brought about by the hydrogen bonded environment particularly evident in liquid water. Each liquid water molecule is involved in about four hydrogen bonds with strengths considerably less than covalent bonds but considerably greater than the natural thermal energy. These hydrogen bonds are roughly tetrahedrally arranged such that when strongly formed the local clustering expands, decreasing the density. Such low density structuring naturally occurs at low and supercooled temperatures and gives rise to many physical and chemical properties that evidence the particular uniqueness of liquid water.

This system can be solved exactly in the chiral limit. We have established the space of the smooth test functions (consisting of the Green's functions for the quark propagator and the corresponding quark-gluon vertex) in which our generalized function (the confining gluon propagator) becomes a continuous linear functional. It is a linear topological space $K(c)$ of the infinitely differentiable functions (with respect to the dimensionless momentum variable $x$), having compact support in the region $x \\leq c$. We develop an analytical formalism, the so-called chiral perturbtion theory at the fundamental quark level, which allows one to find explicit solution for the quark propagator in powers of the light quark masses. We also develop an analytical formalism, which allows one to find the solution for the quark propagator in the inverse powers of the heavy quark masses. It justifies the use for the heavy quark propagator its free counterpart up to terms of the order $1/m_Q^3$, where $m_Q$ is the heavy quark mass.

The key problem, that we try to solve in this paper is the probabilistic interpretation of the BFKL Pomeron Calculus in terms of the colourless dipoles and their interactions. We demonstrate that the BFKL Pomeron Calculus has two equivalent descriptions : (i) one is the generating functional which gives a clear probabilistic interpretation of the processes of high energy scattering and also provides a Hamiltonian-like description of the system of interacting dipoles; (ii) the second is the Langevin equation with a specific noise term which is rather complicated. We found that at high energies this Langevin equation can be reduced to the Langevin equation for directed percolation in the momentum space if the impact parameter is large, namely, $b>> 1/k$, where $k$ is the transverse momentum of a dipole. Unfortunately, this simplified form of Langevin equation is not applicable for summation of Pomeron loops, where one integrates over all possible values of impact parameter. We show that the BFKL Pomeron calculus with two vertices (splitting $P\\to P+P$ and merging $P+P\\to P$ of Pomerons) can be interpreted as a system of colourless dipoles with two processes: the decay of one dipole into two and the merging of two dipoles into one dipole.

We found that the models can reproduce with reasonable accuracy the stellar colours for a fair interval in effective temperatures and gravities. The exceptions are: 1) the U-B colour, where the models are typically redder than the observations, and; 2) the very cool stars in general (V-K > ~3).Concerning the high resolution features, we measured 35 spectral indices defined in the literature on three high resolution synthetic libraries (Coelho et al. 2005; Martins et al. 2005; Munari et al. 2005), and compared them with the observed measurements given by three empirical libraries (Valdes et al.2004; Sanchez-Blazquez et al. 2006; Prugniel & Soubiran 2001). We found that the direct comparison between models and observations is not a simple task, given the uncertainties in parameter determinations of empirical libraries. Taking that aside, we found that in general the three libraries present similar behaviours and systematic deviations. For stars with Teff < 7000K, the library by Coelho et al. (2005) is the one with best average performance. We detect that lists of atomic and molecular line opacities still need improvement, specially in the blue region of thespectrum, and for the cool stars (Teff < ~4500K).

In this paper we present the 92-cm data and a comparison is made with the already published 21-cm results. We analysed 191 pulsars at 92 cm using fluctuation spectra. The sample of pulsars is as unbiased as possible towards any particular pulsar characteristics. For 15 pulsars drifting subpulses are discovered for the first time and 26 of the new drifters found in the 21-cm data are confirmed. We discovered nulling for 8 sources and 8 pulsars are found to intermittently emit single pulses that have pulse energies similar to giant pulses. It is estimated that at least half of the total population of pulsars have drifting subpulses when observations with a high enough signal-to-noise ratio would be available. It could well be that the drifting subpulse mechanism is an intrinsic property of the emission mechanism itself, although for some pulsars it is difficult or impossible to detect. Drifting subpulses are in general found at both frequencies, although the chance of detecting drifting subpulses is possibly slightly higher at 92 cm. It appears that the youngest pulsars have the most disordered subpulses and the subpulses become more and more organized into drifting subpulses as the pulsar ages. The correlations with the modulation indices are argued to be consistent with the picture in which the radio emission can be divided in a drifting subpulse signal plus a quasi-steady signal which becomes, on average, stronger at high observing frequencies. The measured values of P3 at the two frequencies are highly correlated, but there is no evidence for a correlation with other pulsar parameters.

We employ an analytical 2-D model of the large scale coronal magnetic field that provides a good representation of the corona at the minimum of solar activity. We use the mass-flux conservation equation to determine the outflow speed of the solar wind at any location in the solar corona and take into account the integration along the line of sight (LOS). The main assumption we make is that no anisotropy in the kinetic temperature of the coronal species is considered. We find that at distances greater than 1 Rsun from the solar surface the widths of the emitted lines of O VI and Mg X are sensitive to the details of the adopted electron density stratification. However, Ly-$\\alpha$, which is a pure radiative line, is hardly affected. The calculated total intensities of Ly-$\\alpha$ and the O VI doublet depend to a lesser degree on the density stratification and are comparable to the observed ones for most of the considered density models. The widths of the observed profiles of Ly-$\\alpha$ and Mg X are well reproduced by most of the considered electron density stratifications, while for the O VI doublet only few stratifications give satisfying results. The densities deduced from SOHO data result in O VI profiles whose widths and intensity ratio are relatively close to the values observed by UVCS although only isotropic velocity distributions are employed. These density profiles also reproduce the other considered observables with good accuracy. Thus the need for a strong anisotropy of the velocity distribution (i.e. a temperature anisotropy) is not so clear cut as previous investigations of UVCS data suggested. ...

Yet, observations of the few well studied SNe and SN remnants imply condensation efficiencies which are about two orders of magnitude smaller. Motivated by this tension, we have (i) revisited the model of Todini & Ferrara (2001) for dust formation in the ejecta of core collapse SNe and (ii) followed, for the first time, the evolution of newly condensed grains from the time of formation to their survival - through the passage of the reverse shock - in the SN remnant. We find that 0.1 - 0.6 M_sun of dust form in the ejecta of 12 - 40 M_sun stellar progenitors. Depending on the density of the surrounding ISM, between 2-20% of the initial dust mass survives the passage of the reverse shock, on time-scales of about 4-8 x 10^4 yr from the stellar explosion. Sputtering by the hot gas induces a shift of the dust size distribution towards smaller grains. The resulting dust extinction curve shows a good agreement with that derived by observations of a reddened QSO at z =6.2. Stochastic heating of small grains leads to a wide distribution of dust temperatures. This supports the idea that large amounts (~ 0.1 M_sun) of cold dust (T ~ 40K) can be present in SN remnants, without being in conflict with the observed IR emission.

For the length-gauge SFA and undressed bound states, there exist additional terms, which can be interpreted as potential energy shifts. If, on the one hand, such shifts alter the potential barriers through which the electron initially tunnels, and may lead to a questionable physical interpretation of the features encountered, on the other hand they seem to be necessary in order to reproduce the overall maxima and minima in the spectra. Indeed, for dressed electronic bound states in the length gauge, or undressed bound states in the velocity gauge, for which such shifts are absent, there is a breakdown of the interference patterns. In order to avoid such a problem, we provide an alternative pathway for the electron to reach the continuum, by means of an additional attosecond-pulse train.

The spectrum is well reproduced by an absorbed power law with a spectral index Gamma_x=2.4+/-0.4 and a low energy absorption N_H=4(+3;-2)x10^21 cm^(-2) which is higher than the Galactic value. The 15-150 keV prompt emission in GRB 050412 is modelled with a hard (Gamma=0.7+/-0.2) power law. The XRT light curve follows a broken power law with the first slope alpha_1=0.7+/-0.4, the break time T_break=254(-41;+79) s and the second slope alpha_2=2.8(-0.8;+0.5). The spectrum is fitted by a power law with spectral index Gamma_x=1.3+/-0.2 which is absorbed at low energies by the Galactic column. The GRB 050410 afterglow reveals the expected characteristics of the third component of the canonical Swift light curve. Conversely, a complex phenomenology was detected in the GRB 050412 because of the presence of the very early break. The light curve in this case can be interpreted as being the last peak of the prompt emission. The two bursts present tight upper limits for the optical emission, however, neither of them can be clearly classified as dark. For GRB 050410, the suppression of the optical afterglow could be attributed to a low density interstellar medium surrounding the burst. For GRB 050412, the evaluation of the darkness is more difficult due to the ambiguity in the extrapolation of the X-ray afterglow light curve.

Our results indicate that the afterglows of GRB 050410 and GRB 050412 are not as faint as previously thought, and that the observed flux is consistent with a standard GRB model.

One century ago, Minkowski obtained a rigorous lower bound that is controlled asymptotically by $1/2^d$, where $d$ is the Euclidean space dimension. An indication of the difficulty of the problem can be garnered from the fact that exponential improvement of Minkowski's bound has proved to be elusive, even though existing upper bounds suggest that such improvement should be possible. Using a statistical-mechanical procedure to optimize the density associated with a \"test\" pair correlation function and a conjecture concerning the existence of disordered sphere packings [S. Torquato and F. H. Stillinger, Experimental Math. {\\bf 15}, 307 (2006)], the putative exponential improvement was found with an asymptotic behavior controlled by $1/2^{(0.77865...)d}$. Using the same methods, we investigate whether this exponential improvement can be further improved by exploring other test pair correlation functions correponding to disordered packings. We demonstrate that there are simpler test functions that lead to the same asymptotic result. More importantly, we show that there is a wide class of test functions that lead to precisely the same exponential improvement and therefore the asymptotic form $1/2^{(0.77865...)d}$ is much more general than previously surmised.

The presence of a FUV-dropout in their spectral energy distributions proved to be a very complete (83.3%) but not very efficient (21.4%) tool for identifying Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) at z~1. We divide the LBG sample into two sub-classes: red LBGs (RLBGs) detected at 24 micron which are mainly Luminous IR Galaxies (LIRGs) and blue LBGs (BLBGs) undetected at 24 microns down to 83 microJy. Two of the RLBGs are also detected at 70 micron. The median SED of the RLBGs is similar (above lambda~1 micron) to the dusty starburst HR10. However, unlike local (U)LIRGs, RLBGs are UV bright objects. We suggest that these objects contain a large amount of dust but that some bare stellar populations are also directly visible. The median SED of the BLBGs is consistent with their containing the same stellar population as the RLBGs but with a lower dust content. The luminosity function of our LBG sample at z~1 is similar to the luminosity function of NUV-selected galaxies at the same redshift. The integrated luminosity densities of z~1 LBGs and NUV-selected galaxies are very consistent. We show that star formation rates (SFRs) estimated from UV measurements and corrected using the IRX-beta method provide average total SFR_TOT in agreement with SFR_UV + SFR_dust. However, IRX-beta-based SFR_TOT shows a large dispersion. Summing up the detected UV (1150A rest-frame) and IR-based star formation rates of the detected objects, we find that only one third of the total (i.e. UV + dust) LBG SFR resides in BLBGs and two thirds in RLBGs, even though most LBGs at z~1 are BLBGs. On the other hand, the total SFR of LBGs accounts for only 11% of the total SFR at z~1. Finally, we observe a regular decrease of L_TIR / L_FUV from z=0 to z~2 for UV-selected samples.

We also find that the widths of quarkonia are sensitive to the quarkonium's radial excitation, with higher excited states exhibiting larger widths. Our findings have important implications for the interpretation of experimental data on quarkonium production and suppression in heavy-ion collisions. We demonstrate that our approach can reproduce the experimental data on quarkonium suppression in a satisfactory manner, providing new insights into the thermal widths of quarkonia in the QGP."}

Despite many studies have been performed in past years, very few is know for the light-curves of these objects and inconsistencies are present between colours derived by different authors. This situation motivated our effort to improve both the knowledge of colours and light curves. We present and discuss time series observations of Sycorax, Prospero, Stephano, Setebos and Trinculo, five faint irregular satellites of Uranus, carried out at VLT, ESO Paranal (Chile) in the nights between 29 and 30 July, 2005 and 25 and 30 November, 2005.

For Sycorax we obtain colours B-V =0.839 +/- 0.014, V-R = 0.531 +/- 0.005 and a light curve which is suggestive of a periodical variation with period about 3.6 hours and amplitude about 0.067 +/- 0.004 mag. The periods and colours we derive for Sycorax are in agreement with our previous determination in 1999 using NTT. We derive also a light-curve for Prospero which suggests an amplitude of about 0.2 mag and a periodicity of about 4 hours. However, the sparseness of our data, prevents a more precise characterization of the light-curves, and we can not determine wether they are one-peaked or two-peaked. Hence, these periods and amplitudes have to be considered preliminary estimates. As for Setebos, Stephano and Trinculo the present data do not allow to derive any unambiguous periodicity, despite Setebos displays a significant variability with amplitude about as large as that of Prospero.

Here we analyze the performance of Random Vector Quantization (RVQ), in which the precoding matrix is selected from a random codebook containing independent, isotropically distributed entries. We assume that channel elements are i.i.d. and known to the receiver, which relays the optimal (rate-maximizing) precoder codebook index to the transmitter using B bits. We first derive the large system capacity of beamforming (rank-one precoding matrix) as a function of B, where large system refers to the limit as B and the number of transmit and receive antennas all go to infinity with fixed ratios. With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal, i.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. The performance of RVQ is also compared with that of a simpler reduced-rank scalar quantization scheme in which the beamformer is constrained to lie in a random subspace. We subsequently consider a precoding matrix with arbitrary rank, and approximate the asymptotic RVQ performance with optimal and linear receivers (matched filter and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE)). Numerical examples show that these approximations accurately predict the performance of finite-size systems of interest. Given a target spectral efficiency, numerical examples show that the amount of feedback required by the linear MMSE receiver is only slightly more than that required by the optimal receiver, whereas the matched filter can require significantly more feedback.

For very rapidly rotating black holes (spin a=J/M>0.9524M) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbits whose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbit's inclination with respect to the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed. This behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact opposite to the \"normal\" behavior of black hole orbits. Such behavior was noted previously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close to the black hole, they were named \"nearly horizon-skimming orbits\". Our analysis generalizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric) family of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbits reported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimming orbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorial configuration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growing orbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorial configuration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that the earlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearly horizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxes based on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and to equatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also for eccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits. We also find that the inclination change is, in any case, very small. As such, we conclude that these orbits are not likely to have a clear and peculiar imprint on the gravitational waveforms expected to be measured by the space-based detector LISA.

Due to their inherently compact sizes, any detailed quantitative analysis of their morphologies has proved to be difficult in the past. In this work we use the high angular resolution imaging data, from the HST/ACS GOODS survey, to study the quantitative morphology of a complete sample of LCGs in the redshift range 0.5 < z < 1.2. We have derived structural parameters for a representative sample of 39 LCGs selected from the GOODS-S field, using full 2-dimensional surface brightness profile fitting of the galaxy images in each of the four filters available. B-z color maps are used as an aid in the morphological classification. We then use the rest frame B band bulge flux fraction (B/T) to determine the morphological class of the galaxies. Mergers were essentially identified visually by the presence of multiple maxima of comparable intensity in the rest frame B band images, aided by the color maps to distinguish them from HII regions. We derive the following morphological mix for our sample of intermediate redshift LCGs: Mergers: ~36%, Disk dominated: ~22%, S0: ~20%, Early types: ~7%, Irr/tadpole: ~15%. We establish that our sample LCGs are intermediate mass objects with a median stellar mass of Log(M/M_{\\odot})=10.32. We also derive dust enshrouded SFR values ranging from a few to ~65 $M_{\\odot}$/year using Spitzer 24$\\mu m$ data. We estimate a factor ~11 fall in the comoving number density of blue LCGs from redshifts 0.5 < z < 1.2 to the current epoch.

The effect of the optical depth due to the intergalactic infrared background radiation (IIBR) on the peak of the high-energy component of 3C 66A was found to be negligible. Also, the presence of a broad line region (BLR) in the case of 3C 66A may play an important role in the emission of gamma-ray photons when the emission region is very close to the central engine, but further out, the production mechanism of hard X-ray and gamma-ray photons becomes rapidly dominated by synchrotron self-Compton emission.

We compute Fourier phase-difference spectra that are spatially averaged separately over mossy and non-mossy plage to study temporal modulations as a function of temporal frequency. The 1550 versus 171 A comparison shows zero phase difference in non-mossy plage. In mossy plage, the phase differences between all UV and EUV passbands show pronounced upward trends with increasing frequency, which abruptly changes into zero phase difference beyond 4-6 mHz. The phase difference between the 171 and 195 A sequences exhibits a shallow dip below 3 mHz and then also turns to zero phase difference beyond this value. We attribute the various similarities between the UV and EUV diagnostics that are evident in the phase-difference diagrams to the contribution of the C IV resonance lines in the 1550 and 1600 A passbands. The strong upward trend at the lower frequencies indicates the presence of upward-traveling disturbances. It points to correspondence between the lower chromosphere and the upper transition region, perhaps by slow-mode magnetosonic disturbances, or by a connection between chromospheric and coronal heating mechanisms. The transition from this upward trend to zero phase difference at higher frequencies is due to the intermittent obscuration by fibrils that occult the foot points of hot loops, which are bright in the EUV and C IV lines, in oscillatory manner.

Takayama et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 87, 061107 (2005)], the triangular lattice of triangular air holes may allow to achieve a complete photonic band gap in two-dimensional photonic crystal slabs.

Photonic mode dispersion below and above the light line, gap maps, and intrinsic diffraction losses of quasi-guided modes are calculated for the periodic lattice as well as for line- and point-defects defined therein. The main results are summarized as follows: (i) the triangular lattice of triangular holes does indeed have a complete photonic band gap for the fundamental guided mode, but the useful region is generally limited by the presence of second-order waveguide modes; (ii) the lattice may support the usual photonic band gap for even modes (quasi-TE polarization) and several band gaps for odd modes (quasi-TM polarization), which could be tuned in order to achieve doubly-resonant frequency conversion between an even mode at the fundamental frequency and an odd mode at the second-harmonic frequency; (iii) diffraction losses of quasi-guided modes in the triangular lattices with circular and triangular holes, and in line-defect waveguides or point-defect cavities based on these geometries, are comparable.

Firstly, we describe fluctuations in the occupation numbers of the energy levels for an isolated system, using previously unknown identities that we have derived for the purpose, which allow us to calculate the moments of the occupation numbers. Then we compute analytically the probability distribution of these fluctuations. We show that, for every system of fixed and finite $N$, fluctuations about the equilibrium distribution do, in fact, depend on the temperature. Indeed, at higher temperatures the fluctuations can be so large that the system does not fully converge on the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution but actually fluctuates around it.

Remarkably, the model possesses an exact solution when tuned to a special manifold in its parameter space known as the Toulouse limit. We use the Toulouse limit to exactly calculate the adiabatically pumped spin current in the Kondo regime. In the absence of both potential scattering and a voltage bias, the instantaneous charge current is strictly zero for a generic Kondo model. However, a nonzero spin current can be pumped through the system in the presence of a finite magnetic field, provided the spin couples asymmetrically to the two leads. Tunneling through a Kondo impurity thus offers a natural mechanism for generating a pure spin current. We show, in particular, that one can devise pumping cycles along which the average spin pumped per cycle is closely equal to $\\hbar$. By analogy with Brouwer's formula for noninteracting systems with two driven parameters, the pumped spin current is expressed as a geometrical property of a scattering matrix. However, the relevant %Alex: I replaced topological with geometrical in the sentence above scattering matrix that enters the formulation pertains to the Majorana fermions that appear at the Toulouse limit rather than the physical electrons that carry the current. These results are obtained by combining the nonequilibrium Keldysh Green function technique with a systematic gradient expansion, explicitly exposing the small parameter controlling the adiabatic limit.

Material is launched normal to the surface of an oblate rotating star with an initial kick velocity that scales approximately with the local escape speed. Thereafter, ejecta follow ballistic orbital trajectories, feeling only a central force corresponding to a radiatively reduced gravity. Our model is conceptually similar to the wind-compressed disk model of Bjorkman & Cassinelli, but we modify it to an explosion instead of a steady line-driven wind, we include a rotationally-distorted star, and we treat the dynamics somewhat differently. Continuum-driving avoids the disk inhibition that normally operates in line-driven winds. Our model provides a simple method by which rotating hot stars can simultaneously produce intrinsically bipolar and equatorial mass ejections, without an aspherical environment or magnetic fields. Although motivated by eta Carinae, the model may have generic application to other LBVs, B[e] stars, or SN1987A's nebula.

The survey covered an area of 26.67 x 26.67 arcmin^2, far beyond the tidal radius of Leo II (8.63 arcmin), down to the limiting magnitude of V ~26, which is roughly 1 mag deeper than the turn-off point of the main sequence stars of Leo II. Radial number density profiles of bright and faint red giant branch (RGB) stars were found to change their slopes at around the tidal radius, and extend beyond the tidal radius with shallower slopes. A smoothed surface brightness map of Leo II suggests the existence of a small substructure of globular cluster luminosity beyond the tidal radius. We investigated the properties of the stellar population by means of the color-magnitude diagram. The horizontal branch (HB) morphology index shows a radial gradient in which red HB stars are more concentrated than blue HB stars, which is common to many Local Group dwarf spheroidal galaxies. The color distribution of RGB stars around the mean RGB sequence shows a larger dispersion at the center than in the outskirts, indicating a mixture of stellar populations at the center and a more homogeneous population in the outskirts. Based on the age estimation using subgiant branch (SGB) stars, we found that although the major star formation took place ~8 Gyr ago, a considerable stellar population younger than 8 Gyr is found at the center; such a younger population is insignificant in the outskirts.

We obtain these predictions by first showing that the matrix V_M, product of the quark (CKM) and lepton (PMNS) mixing matrices, may have a zero (1,3) entry which is favored by experimental data.   We obtain that any theoretical model with a vanishing (1,3) entry of V_M that is in agreement with quark data, solar, and atmospheric mixing angle leads to $\\theta_{13}^{PMNS}=(9{^{+1}_{-2}})^\\circ$. This value is consistent with the present 90% CL experimental upper limit. We also investigate the prediction on the lepton phases. We show that the actual evidence, under the only assumption that the correlation matrix V_M product of CKM and PMNS has a zero in the entry (1,3), gives us a prediction for the three CP-violating invariants J, S_1, and S_2. A better determination of the lepton mixing angles will give stronger prediction for the CP-violating invariants in the lepton sector. These will be tested in the next generation experiments. Finally we compute the effect of non diagonal neutrino mass in \"l_i -> l_j gamma\" in SUSY theories with non trivial Quark-Lepton complementarity and a flavor symmetry. The Quark-Lepton complementarity and the flavor symmetry strongly constrain the theory and we obtain a clear prediction for the contribution to \"mu -> e gamma\" and the \"tau\" decays \"tau -> e gamma\" and \"tau -> mu gamma\". If the Dirac neutrino Yukawa couplings are degenerate but the low energy neutrino masses are not degenerate, then the lepton decays are related among them by the V_M entries.

If each such halo hosted one luminous red galaxy (LRG) then the accretion of so many halos is at odds with the observed number of LRGs in clusters unless these accreted LRGs merge or disrupt on relatively short timescales (~2Gyr). These timescales are consistent with classical dynamical friction arguments, and imply that 2-3 LRGs have merged or disrupted within each halo more massive than 10^14Msun by z=0. The total amount of stellar mass brought into these massive halos by z=0 is consistent with observations once the intracluster light (ICL) is included. If disrupted LRGs build up the ICL, then the hierarchical growth of massive halos implies that a substantial amount of ICL should also surround satellite LRGs, as suggested by recent observations of the Virgo cluster.

Specifically, we find that the collapse temperature initially increases with increasing strength of the hydrogen-like interactions, but subsequently decreases as the isotropic interactions become dominant. This non-monotonic behavior is attributed to the competition between the attractive and repulsive forces arising from these interactions. Our findings have important implications for understanding the behavior of polymers in various environments, including biological and industrial applications. We believe that this work provides new insights into the complex interplay between hydrogen-like and isotropic interactions in polymer collapse."}

This survey provides a high quality set of spectroscopic data for ~6000 galaxies in 48 clusters. A salient feature of this model is the possibility of treating dust extinction as a function of age, allowing younger stars to be more obscured than older ones. Our technique, for the first time, takes into account this feature in a spectral fitting code. A set of template spectra spanning a wide range of star formation histories is built, with features closely resembling those of typical spectra in our sample in terms of spectral resolution, noise and wavelength coverage. Our method of analyzing these spectra allows us to test the reliability and the uncertainties related to each physical parameter we are inferring. The well-known degeneracy problem, i.e. the non-uniqueness of the best fit solution (mass and extinction in different age bins), can be addressed by assigning adequate error bars to the recovered parameters. The values found in this way, together with their error bars, identify the region of parameter space which contains all the possible solutions for a given spectrum. A comparison test was also performed on a WINGS subsample, containing objects in common with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, yielding excellent agreement. We find that the stellar content as a function of age is reliably recovered in four main age bins and that the uncertainties only mildly depend on the S/N ratio. The metallicity of the dominant stellar population is not always recoverable unambiguosly, depending on the Star Formation History pattern.

This is similar to the case of the B-emission X-ray binaries, where a sizable fraction of the neutron stars received hardly any velocity kick at birth (Pfahl et al. 2002). The masses of the second-born neutron stars in five of the six low-eccentricity double neutron stars are remarkably low (between 1.18 and 1.30 Msun). It is argued that these low-mass, low-kick neutron stars were formed by the electron-capture collapse of the degenerate O-Ne-Mg cores of helium stars less massive than about 3.5 Msun, whereas the higher-mass, higher kick-velocity neutron stars were formed by the collapses of the iron cores of higher initial mass. The absence of low-velocity single young radio pulsars (Hobbs et al. 2005) is consistent with the model proposed by Podsiadlowski et al.

The resulting dissolution times of clusters in the solar neighborhood (SN) and in interacting galaxies are shorter than predicted by two-body relaxation of clusters in a tidal field.

Furthermore, the distribution of equivalent widths of the GRB and QSO samples are consistent with being drawn from the same parent population. Although the results for Mg II and C IV absorbers along GRB sightlines appear to contradict one another, we note that the surveys are nearly disjoint: the C IV survey corresponds to higher redshift and more highly ionized gas than the Mg II survey.

When such a highly ionized hot ``super-bubble'' falls along the sightline to a background quasar, it would be seen as a large void, with little or no absorption, in the Lyman alpha forest. We examine the spectra of 137 quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, to search for such voids, and find no clear evidence of their existence. The size distribution of voids in the range 5-70 Angstrom (corresponding to physical sizes of approximately 3-35 comoving Mpc/h) is consistent with the standard model for the Lyman alpha forest without additional hot bubbles. We adapt a physical model for HII bubble growth during cosmological reionization (Furlanetto, Zaldarriaga and Hernquist 2004), to describe the expected size-distribution of hot super-bubbles at redshift around z = 3. This model incorporates the conjoining of bubbles around individual neighboring galaxies. Using the non-detection of voids, we find that models in which the volume filling factor of hot bubbles exceeds approximately 20 percent at z=3 can be ruled out, primarily because they overproduce the number of large (40-50 Angstrom) voids.

We employ a combination of analytical and numerical approaches to study this phenomenon, including the use of the stochastic population dynamics framework and individual-based simulations. Our results show that the selection against demographic stochasticity can lead to the stabilization of population dynamics, reducing the variance of population sizes and the risk of extinction.

Computing halfspace depth is NP-hard, and it is equivalent to the Maximum Feasible Subsystem problem. In this thesis a mixed integer program is formulated with the big-M method for the halfspace depth problem. We suggest a branch and cut algorithm. In this algorithm, Chinneck's heuristic algorithm is used to find an upper bound and a related technique based on sensitivity analysis is used for branching.

As a result of this coupling, neutrinos in the early universe instead of streaming freely could form a self-coupled fluid, with potentially observable signatures in the Cosmic Microwave Background and the large scale structure of the universe. We re-examine the constraints on this scenario from the presently available cosmological data and investigate the sensitivity expected from the Planck satellite. In the first case, we find that the sensitivity strongly depends on which piece of data is used. The SDSS Main sample data, combined with WMAP and other data, disfavors the scenario of three coupled neutrinos at about the 3.5$\\sigma$ confidence level, but also favors a high number of freely streaming neutrinos, with the best fit at 5.2. If the matter power spectrum is instead taken from the SDSS Large Red Galaxy sample, best fit point has 2.5 freely streaming neutrinos, but the scenario with three coupled neutrinos becomes allowed at $2\\sigma$. In contrast, Planck alone will exclude even a single self-coupled neutrino at the $4.2\\sigma$ confidence level, and will determine the total radiation at CMB epoch to $\\Delta N_\\nu^{eff} = ^{+0.5}_{-0.3}$ ($1\\sigma$ errors).

For this purpose we have derived new bolometric corrections for Ap stars.   Magnetic fields are present at the surfaces of Ap stars from the ZAMS to the TAMS.

Furthermore, we find that the lattice mismatch between the epitaxial layers leads to a significant reduction in phonon transmission, particularly at frequencies corresponding to the mismatch-induced phonon modes. Our results provide insight into the fundamental mechanisms governing phonon transmission across epitaxial interfaces and have implications for the design of advanced thermal management systems and heterostructures.

The purpose of this paper is theoretical and aims at developing an inverse kinetic approach of this type. In principle infinite solutions exist to this problem but the freedom can be exploited in order to meet important requirements. In particular, the discrete kinetic theory can be defined so that it yields exactly the fluid equation also for arbitrary non-equilibrium (but suitably smooth) kinetic distribution functions and arbitrarily close to the boundary of the fluid domain. Unlike previous entropic LB methods the theorem can be obtained without functional constraints on the class of the initial distribution functions.

However, when a green cluster comes in touch with the red substance, it is immediately invaded by the latter, stops growing and starts to act as red substance itself. In our main model space is represented by a graph, of which initially each vertex is randomly green, red or white (vacant), and the growth of the green clusters is similar to that in first-passage percolation. The main issues we investigate are whether the model is well-defined on an infinite graph (e.g. the $d$-dimensional cubic lattice), and what can be said about the distribution of the size of a green cluster just before it is paralyzed. We show that, if the initial density of red vertices is positive, and that of white vertices is sufficiently small, the model is indeed well-defined and the above distribution has an exponential tail. In fact, we believe this to be true whenever the initial density of red is positive.

The gravitational field of the system is dominated by the black hole in its sphere of influence. It is further modified by the cluster mean field (a spherical term) and a gaseous disc/torus (an axially symmetric term) causing a secular evolution of stellar orbits via Kozai oscillations. Intermittent phases of large eccentricity increase the chance that stars become damaged inside the tidal radius of the central hole. Such events can produce debris and lead to recurring episodes of enhanced accretion activity. We introduce an effective loss cone and associate it with tidal disruptions during the high-eccentricity phases of the Kozai cycle. By numerical integration of the trajectories forming the boundary of the loss cone we determine its shape and volume. We also include the effect of relativistic advance of pericentre. The potential of the disc has the efffect of enlarging the loss cone and, therefore, the predicted number of tidally disrupted stars should grow by factor of ~10^2. On the other hand, the effect of the cluster mean potential together with the relativistic pericentre advance act against the eccentricity oscillations. In the end we expect the tidal disruption events to be approximately ten times more frequent in comparison with the model in which the three effects -- the cluster mean field, the relativistic pericentre advance, and the Kozai mechanism -- are all ignored. The competition of different influences suppresses the predicted star disruption rate as the black hole mass increases.

Overall, both the NFPS and SDSS show a modest fraction of BCGs with emission lines (~15%). No trend in the fraction of emitting BCGs as a function of galaxy mass or cluster velocity dispersion is found. However we find that, for those BCGs found in cooling flow clusters, 71^{+9}_{-14}% have optical emission.

Excluding the cooling flow clusters, only ~10% of BCGs are line emitting, comparable to the control sample of galaxies. We show that the physical origin of the emission line activity varies: in some cases it has LINER-like line ratios, whereas in others it is a composite of star-formation and LINER-like activity.

It specifically allows us to extract the effective depth of the ion trap as the activation energy for evaporation. As a function of the rf amplitude we find two distinct regimes related to the stability of motion of the trapped ions. For low amplitudes the entire trap allows for stable motion and the trap depth increases with the rf field. For larger rf amplitudes, however, rapid energy transfer from the field to the ion motion can occur at large trap radii, which leads to a reduction of the effective trapping volume. In this regime the trap depth decreases again with increasing rf amplitude.

Firstly, a standard cold accretion disc with an active X-ray emitting corona is assumed to oscillate. Secondly, only a hot X-ray emitting accretion flow oscillates, while the cold disc is absent at the QPO radius.

In particular, the QPO spectrum contains the disc component in the oscillating disc with a corona scenario.

The chain size, studied by the radius of gyration, shows three different variational behaviors with salt concentration, depending on the chain stiffness. According to these behaviors, polyelectrolytes of fixed chain length are classified into three categories: flexible chain, semiflexible chain, and rigid chain. The worm-like chain model with persistence length predicted by the Odijk-Skolnick-Fixman theory is found to be able to qualitatively describe the end-to-end distance at low salt concentration. In a low-salt region, a flexible polyelectrolyte extends more significantly than a semiflexible chain, and in a high-salt region, regardless of chain stiffness, a chain attains a dimension comparable to that of its neutral polymer. The chain stiffness influences both the local and the global chain structures. A flexible chain exhibits a zigzagged local structure in the presence of salt ions and the condensed structure is a disordered, random globule. A semiflexible chain is locally smooth, and the condensed structure is orderly packed, taking a form such as hairpin or toroid. Moreover, the chain stiffness can also affect the nature of the coil-globule transition. The transition is occurred in a discrete manner for semiflexible chain, whereas in a continuous way for flexible chain. This discrete feature is happened not only at low salt concentration when a semiflexible chain is collapsed, but also at high salt concentration when the collapsed chain is reexpanded. At the end, the effects of chain stiffness and salt concentration on the conformation of single polyelectrolytes are summarized in a schematic state diagram.

Sampling is commonly applied on routers in order to limit the load incurred by the collection of information that the router has to undertake when evaluating flow information for monitoring purposes. The sampling process in nearly all cases is a deterministic process of choosing 1 in every N packets on a per-interface basis, and then forming the flow statistics based on the collected sampled statistics. Even though this sampling may not be significant for some statistics, such as packet rate, others can be severely distorted. However, it is important to consider the sampling techniques and their relative accuracy when applied to different traffic patterns. The main disadvantage of sampling is the loss of accuracy in the collected trace when compared to the original traffic stream. To date there has not been a detailed analysis of the impact of sampling at a router in various traffic profiles and flow criteria.

It has been found that hole doping with Li decreases the superconducting transition temperature Tc, but at a slower rate than electron doping with C or Al. Tc of MgB2 crystals with simultaneously substituted Li for Mg and C for B decreases more than in the case where C is substituted alone. This means that holes introduced by Li cannot counterbalance the effect of decrease of Tc caused by introduction of electrons coming from C. The possible reason of it can be that holes coming from Li occupy the pi band while electrons coming from C fill the sigma band. The temperature dependences of the upper critical field Hc2 for Al and Li substituted crystals with the same Tc show a similar dHc2/dT slope at Tc and a similar Hc2(T) behavior, despite of much different substitution level. This indicates that the mechanism controlling Hc2 and Tc is similar in both hole and electron doped crystals. Electrical transport measurements show an increase of resistivity both in Li substituted crystals and in Li and C co-substituted crystals.

We compare three outflow models: No outflows, a \"constant wind\" (cw) model that emulates the popular Dekel & Silk (1986) scenario, and a ``momentum-driven wind\" (vzw) model. We find that only the vzw scaling reproduces the observed z~2 MZR's slope, amplitude, and scatter. Comparing our fully three-dimensional simulations with a simple one-zone chemical evolution model, we find that the MZR can be understood in terms of three parameters: (1) The equilibrium metallicity Z_eq=y*SFR/ACC (where y=true yield), reflecting the enrichment balance between star formation rate SFR and gas accretion rate ACC; (2) the dilution time t_d=M_g/ACC, representing the timescale for a galaxy to return to Z_eq after a metallicity-perturbing interaction; and (3) the blowout mass M_blowout, which is the galaxy stellar mass above which winds can escape its halo. When outflows with mass loading factor MLF are present, galaxies below M_blowout obey Z_eq = y/(1+MLF), while above M_blowout, Z_eq->y. Our cw model has M_blowout ~ 10^10 M_sun, which yields a sharp upturn in the MZR above this scale and a flat MZR with large scatter below it, in strong disagreement with observations. Our vzw model reproduces the observed Z_g \\propto M_*^0.3 because Z_eq \\propto MLF^-1 \\propto M_*^1/3 when MLF >> 1 (i.e. at low masses). The flattening of the MZR at M_* > 10^10.5 M_sun observed by Tremonti et al. (2004) reflects the mass scale where MLF~1, rather than a characteristic wind speed. The tight observed MZR scatter is ensured when t_d<1 dynamical time, which is only satisified at all masses and epochs in our momentum-driven wind model.

Previous models of Solar System formation considered a supernova shock that triggered the collapse of the Sun's nascent molecular cloud. We advocate an alternative hypothesis, that the Solar System's protoplanetary disk had already formed when a very close (< 1 pc) supernova injected radioactive material directly into the disk. We conduct the first numerical simulations designed to answer two questions related to this hypothesis: will the disk be destroyed by such a close supernova; and will any of the ejecta be mixed into the disk? Our simulations demonstrate that the disk does not absorb enough momentum from the shock to escape the protostar to which it is bound. Only low amounts (< 1%) of mass loss occur, due to stripping by Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities across the top of the disk, which also mix into the disk about 1% of the intercepted ejecta. These low efficiencies of destruction and injectation are due to the fact that the high disk pressures prevent the ejecta from penetrating far into the disk before stalling. Injection of gas-phase ejecta is too inefficient to be consistent with the abundances of radionuclides inferred from meteorites. On the other hand, the radionuclides found in meteorites would have condensed into dust grains in the supernova ejecta, and we argue that such grains will be injected directly into the disk with nearly 100% efficiency. The meteoritic abundances of the short-lived radionuclides such as 60Fe therefore are consistent with injection of grains condensed from the ejecta of a nearby (< 1 pc) supernova, into an already-formed protoplanetary disk.

Effects of nonlocal excitations are clarified by comparing the results with those of the single-site approximation.

The spectra at the Fermi level yield a hole-like Fermi surface in the underdoped region and an electron-like Fermi surface in the overdoped region. From a numerical analysis of the momentum dependent effective mass and self-energy, it is concluded that a marginal Fermi-liquid like state persists even at finite doping concentrations in the strongly correlated region because a van Hove singularity is pinned to the Fermi surface. It is also found that a kink structure appears in the quasiparticle energy band in the same region. The kink is shown to be caused by a mixing between the quasiparticle band and an excitation band with strong short-range antiferromagnetic correlations.

Uncertainties in mass calibration of clusters can be reduced by using the properties of halo clustering (the clustering of clusters). However, within a single survey, weak lensing and halo clustering probe the same density fluctuations. We explore the question of whether this information can be used twice -- once in weak lensing and then again in halo clustering to calibrate cluster masses -- or whether the combined dark energy constraints are weaker than the sum of the individual constraints. For a survey like the Dark Energy Survey (DES), we find that the cosmic shearing of source galaxies at high redshifts is indeed highly correlated with halo clustering at lower redshifts. Surprisingly, this correlation does not degrade cosmological constraints for a DES-like survey, and in fact, constraints are marginally improved since the correlations themselves act as additional observables. This considerably simplifies the analysis for a DES-like survey: when weak lensing and halo clustering are treated as independent experiments, the combined dark energy constraints (cluster counts included) are accurate if not slightly conservative. Our findings mirror those of Takada and Bridle, who investigated correlations between the cosmic shear and cluster counts.

The latter is a key property of the Moon's apparent orbit around the Earth - the nodes of that orbit precess around the ecliptic, completing one revolution every 18.6 years. This precession is responsible for a number of astronomical phenomena, e.g. the year to year drift of solar and lunar eclipse periods. It also controls the ecliptic latitude at which the Moon crosses the magnetotail and thus the number and duration of lunar encounters with the plasmasheet. This paper presents a detailed model of those encounters and applies it to the period 1960 to 2030. This shows that the total lunar exposure to the plasmasheet will vary from 10 hours per month at a minimum of the eighteen-year cycle rising to 40 hours per month at the maximum. These variations could have a profound impact on the accumulation of charge due plasmasheet electrons impacting the lunar surface. Thus we should expect the level of lunar surface charging to vary over the eighteen-year cycle. The literature contains reports that support this: several observations made during the cycle maximum of 1994-2000 are attributed to bombardment and charging of the lunar surface by plasmasheet electrons. Thus we conclude that lunar surface charging will vary markedly over an eighteen-year cycle driven by lunar precession. It is important to interpret lunar environment measurements in the context of this cycle and to allow for the cycle when designing equipment for deployment on the lunar surface. This is particularly important in respect of developing plans for robotic exploration on the lunar surface during the next cycle maximum of 2012-19.

A particle motion in this system can be chaotic when the gravitational contribution from a surface density of a disk is comparable with that from a point mass. In such an orbit, we sometimes find that there appears a phase of the orbit in which particle motion becomes to be nearly regular (the so-called ``stagnant motion'') for a finite time interval between more strongly chaotic phases. To study how these different chaotic behaviours affect on observation of gravitational waves, we investigate a correlation of the particle motion and the waves. We find that such a difference in chaotic motions reflects on the wave forms and energy spectra. The character of the waves in the stagnant motion is quite different from that either in a regular motion or in a more strongly chaotic motion.

The metallicities for relatively short vertical distances (z<2.5 kpc) show systematic fluctuations with Galactic longitude, similar to those of the thick-disc scaleheight, which may be interpreted as indicating a common origin, viz., the flare effect of the disc. This suggestion is supported by the metallicity variations which we find as functions of radial distance. The metallicity variation at larger vertical distances (6.5<z<9.5 kpc) is small but monotonic. Three different vertical metallicity gradients could be detected: d[M/H]/dz=-0.22(+/-0.03), d[M/H]/dz=-0.38 (+/-0.06), and d[M/H]/dz=-0.08 (+/-0.07) dex/kpc for the intervals z<3, 3<z<5, and 5<z<10 kpc, respectively. Since our data cover the whole Galactic longitude interval, the resulting metallicity gradients can be interpreted as properties of the larger-scale Galaxy.

We find that the corrections lead to a more accurate representation of the g-mode frequencies and mode amplitudes, which is crucial for understanding the internal dynamics of stars and the detection of g-mode oscillations in asteroseismology. We employ a numerical approach to solve the 1D MHD equations, incorporating the Coriolis force using a rotationally consistent framework. Our methodology allows for a precise calculation of the g-mode frequencies and mode amplitudes, enabling a detailed analysis of the Coriolis force corrections. Our findings have important implications for the interpretation of asteroseismic data and the understanding of the internal dynamics of stars."}

The radial velocities derived from simultaneous fits to 13 absorption lines indicate an orbital velocity semi-amplitude of K_UV = 47 +/- 3 km/s. However, we find that the phase zero is offset from the white dwarf ephemeris by +0.1. Our offset and velocity amplitude are very similar to constraints derived from optical emission lines from the quiescent accretion disk, despite the fact that we are probing material much closer to the primary. If we associate the UV amplitude with K_1, our dynamical constraints together with the K_2 estimates from Steeghs et al.

Our primary mass estimates are in excellent agreement and are also self-consistent with spectrophotometric fits to the UV fluxes despite the observed phase offset.

In a specific frequency range, this 'foreground noise' is predicted to rise above the instrumental noise and hinder the detection of other types of signals, e.g., gravitational waves arising from stellar mass objects inspiraling into massive black holes. In many previous studies only detached populations of compact object binaries have been considered in estimating the LISA gravitational wave foreground signal. Here, we investigate the influence of compact object detached and Roche-Lobe Overflow Galactic binaries on the shape and strength of the LISA signal. Since >99% of remnant binaries which have orbital periods within the LISA sensitivity range are white dwarf binaries, we consider only these binaries when calculating the LISA signal. We find that the contribution of RLOF binaries to the foreground noise is negligible at low frequencies, but becomes significant at higher frequencies, pushing the frequency at which the foreground noise drops below the instrumental noise to >6 mHz. We find that it is important to consider the population of mass transferring binaries in order to obtain an accurate assessment of the foreground noise on the LISA data stream. However, we estimate that there still exists a sizeable number (~11300) of Galactic double white dwarf binaries which will have a signal-to-noise ratio >5, and thus will be potentially resolvable with LISA.

In the heavy-fermion superconductor CeCoIn5 [5], this linear behaviour was one of the first indications of the presence of a zero-temperature instability, or quantum critical point. Here, we report the observation of a unique control parameter of T-linear scattering in CeCoIn5, found through systematic chemical substitutions of both magnetic and non-magnetic rare-earth, R, ions into the Ce sub-lattice. We find that the evolution of inelastic scattering in Ce1-xRxCoIn5 is strongly dependent on the f-electron configuration of the R ion, whereas two other key properties -- Cooper-pair breaking and Kondo-lattice coherence -- are not. Thus, T-linear resistivity in CeCoIn5 is intimately related to the nature of incoherent scattering centers in the Kondo lattice, which provides insight into the anomalous scattering rate synonymous with quantum criticality [7].

Extending the lifetime of networks composed of battery-operated nodes is a key issue in the design and operation of wireless sensor networks. This paper considers the effects on network lifetime of allowing closely located nodes to use CB/CT to reduce the load or even to avoid packet-forwarding requests to nodes that have critical battery life. First, the effectiveness of CB/CT in improving the signal strength at a faraway destination using energy in nearby nodes is studied. Then, the performance improvement obtained by this technique is analyzed for a special 2D disk case. Further, for general networks in which information-generation rates are fixed, a new routing problem is formulated as a linear programming problem, while for other general networks, the cost for routing is dynamically adjusted according to the amount of energy remaining and the effectiveness of CB/CT. From the analysis and the simulation results, it is seen that the proposed method can reduce the payloads of energy-depleting nodes by about 90% in the special case network considered and improve the lifetimes of general networks by about 10%, compared with existing techniques.

First, we characterize the stability condition under MS decoding. It turns out to be essentially the same condition as under BP decoding. Second, we perform a degree distribution optimization. Contrary to the case of BP decoding, under MS decoding the thresholds of the best degree distributions for standard irregular LDPC ensembles are significantly bounded away from the Shannon threshold. More precisely, on the AWGN channel, for the best codes that we find, the gap to capacity is 1dB for a rate 0.3 code and it is 0.4dB when the rate is 0.9 (the gap decreases monotonically as we increase the rate).   We also used the optimization procedure to design codes for modified MS algorithm where the output of the check node is scaled by a constant $1/\\alpha$. For $\\alpha = 1.25$, we observed that the gap to capacity was lesser for the modified MS algorithm when compared with the MS algorithm.

Here we assess the validity of this approach and compute the leading term of the effective interaction for large interparticle separation beyond this so-called superposition approximation. As an application, we consider the experimentally relevant case of interface deformations owing to the electrostatic field emanating from charged colloidal particles. In mechanical isolation, i.e., if the net force acting on the total system consisting of the particles plus the interface vanishes, the superposition approximation is actually invalid. The effective capillary interaction is governed by contributions beyond this approximation and turns out to be attractive.

We find that fitting accuracy depends sensitively on galaxy profile shape. Exponential disks are well fit with Sersic models and have small measurement errors, whereas fits to de Vaucouleurs profiles show larger uncertainties owing to the large amount of light at large radii. We find that both codes provide reliable fits and little systematic error, when the effective surface brightness is above that of the sky. Moreover, both codes return errors that significantly underestimate the true fitting uncertainties, which are best estimated with simulations. We find that GIM2D suffers significant systematic errors for spheroids with close companions owing to the difficulty of effectively masking out neighboring galaxy light; there appears to be no work around to this important systematic in GIM2D's current implementation. While this crowding error affects only a small fraction of galaxies in GEMS, it must be accounted for in the analysis of deeper cosmological images or of more crowded fields with GIM2D.

In this paper, we pose the following question: suppose that future dark energy surveys constrain w at low redshift to be consistent with -1 to a percent level accuracy, what are the implications for models of dynamical dark energy? We investigate this problem in a model-independent way by following quintessence field trajectories in `energy' phase-space. Attractor dynamics in this phase-space leads to two classes of acceptable models: 1) models with flat potentials, i.e. an effective cosmological constant, and 2) models with potentials that suddenly flatten with a characteristic kink. The prospect of further constraining the second class of models from distance measurements and fluctuation growth rates at low redshift (z<3) seems poor. However, in some models of this second class, the dark energy makes a significant contribution to the total energy density at high redshift. Such models can be further constrained from observation of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies and from primordial nucleosynthesis. It is possible, therefore, to construct models in which the dark energy at high redshift causes observable effects, even if future dark energy surveys constrain w at low redshift to be consistent with -1 to high precision.

With the use of the Buchdahl type inequalities for anisotropic bodies, we derive upper limits on the velocity of the particles defining the cluster. These limits are consistent with those obtained from stability considerations. The study of light deflection shows that the gravitational lensing effect is slightly smaller for the Einstein clusters, as compared to the singular isothermal density sphere model for dark matter. Therefore lensing observations may discriminate, at least in principle, between Einstein cluster and other dark matter models.

Particular attention is paid to the deuteron target within kinematical conditions corresponding to the available and forthcoming experimental data at Jlab.   We argue that there are kinematical regions where FSI effects are minimized, allowing for a reliable investigation of the DIS structure functions, and regions where the interaction of the quark-gluon debris with nucleons is maximized, which makes it possible to study hadronization mechanisms. Nuclear structure has been described by means of realistic wave functions and spectral functions and the final state interaction has been treated within an eikonal approximation approach which takes into account the rescattering of the quark-gluon debris with the residual nucleus and, in the case of complex nuclei, within an optical potential approach to account for the FSI of the struck proton.

These amplitudes are determined by a classical string solution and contain a universal exponential factor involving the action of the classical string. On the gauge theory side, expressions for perturbative amplitudes at strong coupling were previously proposed only for specific helicities of external particles -- the maximally helicity violating or MHV amplitudes. These follow from the exponential ansatz of Bern, Dixon and Smirnov for MHV amplitudes in N=4 SYM. In this paper we examine the amplitudes dependence on helicities and particle-types of external states. We consider the prefactor of string amplitudes and give arguments suggesting that the prefactor at strong coupling should be the same as the Yang-Mills tree-level amplitude for the same process. This implies that scattering amplitudes in N=4 SYM simplify dramatically in the strong coupling limit. It follows from our proposal that in this limit all (MHV and non-MHV) n-point amplitudes are given by the (known) tree-level Yang-Mills result times the helicity-independent (and particle-type-independent) universal exponential.

We study the resulting differentially rotating profile, focusing on the impact this has for type I X-ray bursts. The predominant viscosity is likely provided by the Tayler-Spruit dynamo. The radial and azimuthal magnetic field components have strengths of ~10^5 G and ~10^10 G, respectively. This leads to nearly uniform rotation at the depths of interest for X-ray bursts. A remaining small shear transmits the accreted angular momentum inward to the NS interior. Though this shear gives little viscous heating, it can trigger turbulent mixing. Detailed simulations will be required to fully understand the consequences of mixing, but our models illustrate some general features. Mixing has the greatest impact when the buoyancy at the compositional discontinuity between accreted matter and ashes is overcome. This occurs at high accretion rates, at low spin frequencies, or may depend on the ashes from the previous burst. We then find two new regimes of burning. The first is ignition in a layer containing a mixture of heavier elements from the ashes. If ignition occurs at the base of the mixed layer, recurrence times as short as ~5-30 minutes are possible. This may explain the short recurrence time of some bursts, but incomplete burning is still needed to explain these bursts' energetics. When mixing is sufficiently strong, a second regime is found where accreted helium mixes deep enough to burn stably, quenching X-ray bursts. We speculate that the observed change in X-ray burst properties near one-tenth the Eddington accretion rate is from this mechanism. The carbon-rich material produced by stable helium burning would be important for triggering and fueling superbursts.

The most favoured configurations are those of minimal entropy. Along this class of vacua a four-dimensional space-time is automatically selected; when, at large volume, a description of space-time in terms of classical geometry can be recovered, the entropy-weighted sum reduces to the ordinary Feynman's path integral. What arises is a highly predictive scenario, phenomenologically compatible with the experimental observations and measurements, in which everything is determined in terms of the fundamental constants and the age of the Universe, with no room for freely-adjustable parameters. We discuss how this leads to the known spectrum of particles and interactions. Besides the computation of masses and couplings, CKM matrix elements, cosmological constant, expansion parameters of the Universe etc..., all resulting, within the degree of the approximation we used, in agreement with the experimental observations, we also discuss how this scenario passes the tests provided by cosmology and the constraints imposed by the physics of the primordial Universe.

This is in stark contrast to baryonic gases. We used X-ray observations of two nearby, relaxed galaxy clusters, under the assumptions of hydrostatic equilibrium and identical dark matter and gas temperatures in the outer cluster region, to measure this dark matter temperature anisotropy beta_dm, with non-parametric Monte Carlo methods. We find that beta_dm is greater than the value predicted for baryonic gases, beta_gas=0, at more than 3 sigma confidence.

This unique stellar system is both one of the oldest (8 Gyr) and most metal-rich ([Fe/H] ~ 0.4) open clusters in our Galaxy, and has a color-magnitude diagram (CMD) that exhibits both a red giant clump and a much hotter extreme horizontal branch. Fitting the Balmer lines of the white dwarfs in the cluster, using Keck/LRIS spectra, suggests that most of these stars are undermassive, <M> = 0.43 +/- 0.06 Msun, and therefore could not have formed from canonical stellar evolution involving the helium flash at the tip of the red giant branch. We show that at least 40% of NGC 6791's evolved stars must have lost enough mass on the red giant branch to avoid the flash, and therefore did not convert helium into carbon-oxygen in their core. Such increased mass loss in the evolution of the progenitors of these stars is consistent with the presence of the extreme horizontal branch in the CMD. This unique stellar evolutionary channel also naturally explains the recent finding of a very young age (2.4 Gyr) for NGC 6791 from white dwarf cooling theory; helium core white dwarfs in this cluster will cool ~3 times slower than carbon-oxygen core stars and therefore the corrected white dwarf cooling age is in fact ~7 Gyr, consistent with the well measured main-sequence turnoff age. These results provide direct empirical evidence that mass loss is much more efficient in high metallicity environments and therefore may be critical in interpreting the ultraviolet upturn in elliptical galaxies.

The correlations are determined by means of noise variance measurement for a isolated pixels and the difference between neighbor pixels. The method is validated using images from the two different GE Senographe 2000D mammographic units. The pixelized detector has been irradiated using x-rays along its entire surface. It is shown that the pixel simultaneous detection probabilities can be estimated within accuracy 0.001 - 0.003, where the systematic error is estimated to be smaller than 0.005. The presampled two-dimensional point-spread function (PSF0) is determined using a single Gaussian and a sum of two Gaussian approximations. The obtained results for the presampled PSF0 show that the single Gaussian approximation is not appropriate, and the sum of two Gaussian approximations providing the best fit predicts the existence of a large (~50%) narrow component. Another proof of this fact is the latest simulation study of columnar indirect digital detectors by A. Badano et al. The sampled two-dimensional PSF is determined using Monte Carlo simulation for the L-shape uniform distributed acceptance function for different values of fill factors. The detector spatial resolution is estimated using sampled PSF and has values 54 and 58 mkm for two different units. The calculation of the presampled modulation transfer function based on the PSF0 estimation shows that the existing data can only be reproduced using a single Gaussian approximation and the usage of the sum of two Gaussian show significantly larger values in the higher frequency region for both units.

Our results provide evidence for the importance of extinction by the torus in understanding the observed properties of AGN and highlight the potential of mid-infrared fine structure line ratios as a diagnostic tool for studying the torus."}

This length is by definition the relaxation length of the slowest mode toward equilibrium transport. The model presented by Parteli, Duran and Herrmann [Phys. Rev. E 75, 011301 (2007)] predicts that the saturation length decreases to zero as the inverse of the wind shear stress far from the threshold. We first show that their model is not self-consistent: even under large wind, the relaxation rate is limited by grain inertia and thus can not decrease to zero. A key argument presented by these authors comes from the discussion of the typical dune wavelength on Mars (650 m) on the basis of which they refute the scaling of the dune size with the drag length evidenced by Claudin and Andreotti [Earth Pla. Sci. Lett. 252, 30 (2006)]. They instead propose that Martian dunes, composed of large grains (500 micrometers), were formed in the past under very strong winds. We show that this saltating grain size, estimated from thermal diffusion measurements, is not reliable. Moreover, the microscopic photographs taken by the rovers on Martian aeolian bedforms show a grain size of 87 plus or minus 25 micrometers together with hematite spherules at millimetre scale. As those so-called ``blueberries'' can not be entrained by reasonable winds, we conclude that the saltating grains on Mars are the small ones, which gives a second strong argument against the model of Parteli et al.

Assuming that dark matter is composed primarily of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), a star orbiting close enough to the SMBH can capture WIMPs at an extremely high rate. The stellar luminosity due to annihilation of captured WIMPs in the stellar core may be comparable to or even exceed the luminosity of the star due to thermonuclear burning. The model thus predicts the existence of unusual stars, i.e. \"WIMP burners\", in the vicinity of an adiabatically grown SMBH. We find that the most efficient WIMP burners are stars with degenerate electron cores, e.g. white dwarfs (WD) or degenerate cores with envelopes. If found, such stars would provide evidence for the existence of particle dark matter and could possibly be used to establish its density profile. In our previous paper we computed the luminosity from WIMP burning for a range of dark matter spike density profiles, degenerate core masses, and distances from the SMBH. Here we compare our results with the observed stars closest to the Galactic center and find that they could be consistent with WIMP burners in the form of degenerate cores with envelopes. We also cross-check the WIMP burner hypothesis with the EGRET observed flux of gamma-rays from the Galactic center, which imposes a constraint on the dark matter spike density profile and annihilation cross-section. We find that the EGRET data is consistent with the WIMP burner hypothesis. New high precision measurements by GLAST will confirm or set stringent limits on a dark matter spike at the Galactic center, which will in turn support or set stringent limits on the existence of WIMP burners at the Galactic center.

In the present paper such a data set is used to study the BSS population and its radial distribution. A total number of 39 bright ($m_{218}\\le 19.5$) BSS has been detected, and they have been found to be highly segregated in the cluster core. No significant upturn in the BSS frequency has been observed in the outskirts of NGC 1904, in contrast to other clusters (M 3, 47 Tuc, NGC 6752, M 5) studied with the same technique. Such evidences, coupled with the large radius of avoidance estimated for NGC 1904 ($r_{avoid}\\sim 30$ core radii), indicate that the vast majority of the cluster heavy stars (binaries) has already sunk to the core. Accordingly, extensive dynamical simulations suggest that BSS formed by mass transfer activity in primordial binaries evolving in isolation in the cluster outskirts represent only a negligible (0--10%) fraction of the overall population.

The method is formulated and tested on the two-dimensional interior Poisson and exterior Laplace problems, whose solutions and their normal derivatives are required to be continuous across the interface. A complete basis of homogeneous solutions for the interior and exterior regions, corresponding to all possible Dirichlet boundary values at the interface, are calculated in a preprocessing step. This basis is used to construct the influence matrix which serves to transform the coupled boundary conditions into conditions on the interior problem. Chebyshev approximations are used to represent both the interior solutions and the boundary values. A standard Chebyshev spectral method is used to calculate the interior solutions. The exterior harmonic solutions are calculated as the convolution of the free-space Green's function with a surface density; this surface density is itself the solution to an integral equation which has an analytic solution when the boundary values are given as a Chebyshev expansion. Properties of Chebyshev approximations insure that the basis of exterior harmonic functions represents the external near-boundary solutions uniformly. The method is tested by calculating the electrostatic potential resulting from charge distributions in a rectangle. The resulting influence matrix is well-conditioned and solutions converge exponentially as the resolution is increased. The generalization of this approach to three-dimensional problems is discussed, in particular the magnetohydrodynamic equations in a finite cylindrical domain surrounded by a vacuum.

High Speed Machining highlights some drawbacks of such architectures: heavy moving parts require from the machine structure high stiffness to limit bending problems that lower the machine accuracy, and limit the dynamic performances of the feed axes. That is why PKMs attract more and more researchers and companies, because they are claimed to offer several advantages over their serial counterparts, like high structural rigidity and high dynamic capacities. Indeed, the parallel kinematic arrangement of the links provides higher stiffness and lower moving masses that reduce inertia effects. Thus, PKMs have better dynamic performances. However, the design of a parallel kinematic machine tool (PKMT) is a hard task that requires further research studies before wide industrial use can be expected. Many criteria need to be taken into account in the design of a PKMT. We pay special attention to the description of kinetostatic criteria that rely on the conditioning of the Jacobian matrix of the mechanism. The organisation of this paper is as follows: next section introduces general remarks about PKMs, then is explained why PKMs can be interesting alternative machine tool designs.

The host galaxy shows HII region lines at redshift of z=0.0574, which puts the peak unfiltered absolute magnitude at a somewhat over-luminous -19.6. The spectra show weak and narrow SiII lines, and for a period of at least 10 days beginning around maximum light these profiles do not change in width or depth and they indicate a constant expansion velocity of ~10,600 km/s. We analyzed the observations based on detailed radiation dynamical models in the literature. Whereas delayed detonation and deflagration models have been used to explain the majority of SNe Ia, they do not predict a long velocity plateau in the SiII minimum with an unvarying line profile. Pulsating delayed detonations and merger scenarios form shell-like density structures with properties mostly related to the mass of the shell, M_shell, and we discuss how these models may explain the observed SiII line evolution; however, these models are based on spherical calculations and other possibilities may exist. SN 2005hj is consistent with respect to the onset, duration, and velocity of the plateau, the peak luminosity and, within the uncertainties, with the intrinsic colors for models with M_shell=0.2 M_sun.

Yet, ellipticals, especially luminous ones, show little signs of recent star formation (SF). To investigate the possible cause of the dearth of SF in these systems, we study the gravitational stability of CN gas disks embedded within the potentials of both the stellar bulge and the central massive black hole (BH) in ellipticals. We find that CN disks in higher mass galaxies are generally more stable than those in lower mass galaxies, because higher mass galaxies tend to have more massive BHs and more centrally concentrated stellar density profiles. We also consider the case in which the central stellar density profile has a core, which is often observed for ellipticals whose total stellar mass is higher than about 10^11 Msun. Such a cored stellar density profile leads to more unstable CN disks than the power-law density profile characteristic of less massive galaxies. However, the more massive BHs in high-mass galaxies act to stabilize the CN disk. Our results demonstrate that the gravitational potentials of both the central BH and the stellar component should be taken into account when studying the properties of CN disks, as their stability is sensitive to both the BH mass and the stellar density profile. Our results could explain the observed trend that less luminous ellipticals have a greater tendency to exhibit ongoing SF than giant ellipticals.

The microstructure of the cohesive packing varies according to the assembling procedure, from rather densely packed if isolated particles are directly compressed to much looser if the formation of large aggregates is allowed prior to compression. A crucial parameter is the ratio P*= Pa/F0 of applied pressure P, acting on grains of diameter $a$, to maximum tensile contact force F0. At low P* the final structure depends on the level of velocity fluctuations at the early stages of cluster aggregation. With RR the coordination number approaches 2 in the limit of low initial velocities or large rolling friction.

Perturbations in general relativity as well as in an arbitrary $D$-dimensional metric theory are studied on a background, which is a solution (arbitrary) of the theory. Lagrangian for perturbations is defined, and field equations for perturbations are derived from the variational principle. These equations are exact and equivalent to the equations in the standard formulation, but can be approximate also. The field-theoretical description is invariant under gauge (inner) transformations, which can be presented both in exact and approximate forms. Following the usual field-theoretical prescription, conserved quantities for perturbations are constructed. Conserved currents are expressed through divergences of superpotentials -- antisymmetric tensor densities. This form allows to relate a necessity to consider local properties of perturbations with a theoretical representation of the quasi-local nature of conserved quantities in metric theories. Applications of the formalism in general relativity are discussed. Generalized formulae for an arbitrary metric $D$-dimensional theory are tested in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity.

Because the absorption signature lies buried in the noise of a single exposure we apply a multiline deconvolution to the spectral lines available in order to boost the effective S/N ratio of the data. The wavelength coverage of 80 angstroms is expected to contain ~100 planetary lines, enabling a mean line with S/N ratio of ~800 to be achieved after deconvolution.

The dynamics is modeled using the two-dimensional, axisymmetric thin-shell equations. In the first ~10-100 seconds after core collapse the magnetar inflates a bubble of plasma and magnetic fields behind the supernova shock. The bubble expands asymmetrically because of the pinching effect of the toroidal magnetic field, just as in the analogous problem of the evolution of pulsar wind nebulae. The degree of asymmetry depends on E_mag/E_tot. The correct value of E_mag/E_tot is uncertain because of uncertainties in the conversion of magnetic energy into kinetic energy at large radii in relativistic winds; we argue, however, that bubbles inflated by newly formed magnetars are likely to be significantly more magnetized than their pulsar counterparts. We show that for a ratio of magnetic to total power supplied by the central magnetar L_mag/L_tot ~ 0.1 the bubble expands relatively spherically. For L_mag/L_tot ~ 0.3, however, most of the pressure in the bubble is exerted close to the rotation axis, driving a collimated outflow out through the host star. This can account for the collimation inferred from observations of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Outflows from magnetars become increasingly magnetically dominated at late times, due to the decrease in neutrino-driven mass loss as the young neutron star cools. We thus suggest that the magnetar-driven bubble initially expands relatively spherically, enhancing the energy of the associated supernova, while at late times it becomes progressively more collimated, producing the GRB.

We find that the interaction between the magnetar's magnetic field and the surrounding material drives the formation of a magnetized bubble, which in turn accelerates the particles and collimates the outflow. Our results demonstrate that magnetars can naturally explain the observed collimation of GRB jets, which is a long-standing puzzle in the field. We also find that the magnetar's spin-down energy is sufficient to power the observed GRB luminosities, providing a consistent explanation for the observed correlations between GRB luminosity and jet collimation.

Globular patterns in the STM-images were interpreted as clusters of atoms. These are significant structural units of quasicrystals. The experiments of Ebert et al. imply that they are also stable physical entities, a property controversially discussed currently. For a clarification we performed the first large scale fracture simulations on three-dimensional complex binary systems. We studied the propagation of mode I cracks in an icosahedral model quasicrystal by molecular dynamics techniques at low temperature. In particular we examined how the shape of the cleavage plane is influenced by the clusters inherent in the model and how it depends on the plane structure. Brittle fracture with no indication of dislocation activity is observed. The crack surfaces are rough on the scale of the clusters, but exhibit constant average heights for orientations perpendicular to high symmetry axes. From detailed analyses of the fractured samples we conclude that both, the plane structure and the clusters, strongly influence dynamic fracture in quasicrystals and that the clusters therefore have to be regarded as physical entities.

The analogy with the well-known Schwinger effect is discussed in detail and a systematic comparison of the two physical phenomena is carried out. In particular, it is demonstrated that the two underlying formalisms differ only up to an irrelevant canonical transformation. Hence, the basic physical mechanisms at play are similar in both cases and can be reduced to the quantization of a parametric oscillator leading to particle creation due to the interaction with a classical source: pair production in vacuum is therefore equivalent to the appearance of a growing mode for the cosmological fluctuations. The only difference lies in the nature of the source: an electric field in the case of the Schwinger effect and the gravitational field in the case of inflationary perturbations. Although, in the laboratory, it is notoriously difficult to produce an electric field such that pairs extracted from the vacuum can be detected, the gravitational field in the early universe can be strong enough to lead to observable effects that ultimately reveal themselves as temperature fluctuations in the Cosmic Microwave Background.

In this thesis, we construct stabilising transformations based on the knowledge of the stability matrices of already detected periodic orbits (used as seeds). The advantage of our approach is in a substantial reduction of the number of transformations, which increases the efficiency of the detection algorithm, especially in the case of high-dimensional systems. The performance of the new approach is illustrated by its application to the four-dimensional kicked double rotor map, a six-dimensional system of three coupled H\\'enon maps and to the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky system in the weakly turbulent regime.

The finite speed of propagation of the disturbances in the effective fields (in the simplest models, the speed of sound) plays here the role of the speed of light in fundamental physics. However, these apparently relativistic fields are immersed in an external Newtonian world (the condensed matter system itself and the laboratory can be considered Newtonian, since all the velocities involved are much smaller than the velocity of light) which provides a privileged coordinate system and therefore seems to destroy the possibility of having a perfectly defined relativistic emergent world. In this essay we ask ourselves the following question: In a homogeneous condensed matter medium, is there a way for internal observers, dealing exclusively with the low-energy collective phenomena, to detect their state of uniform motion with respect to the medium? By proposing a thought experiment based on the construction of a Michelson-Morley interferometer made of quasi-particles, we show that a real Lorentz-FitzGerald contraction takes place, so that internal observers are unable to find out anything about their `absolute ' state of motion. Therefore, we also show that an effective but perfectly defined relativistic world can emerge in a fishbowl world situated inside a Newtonian (laboratory) system. This leads us to reflect on the various levels of description in physics, in particular regarding the quest towards a theory of quantum gravity.

We show that there are two qualitatively different dynamical regimes of the coupled breathers, either immovable or slowly-moving: the periodic transverse translation (wandering) of low-amplitude breather between the chains, and the one-chain-localization of high-amplitude breather. These two modes of coupled nonlinear excitations, which involve large number of anharmonic oscillators, can be mapped onto two solutions of a single pendulum equation, detached by a separatrix mode. We also study two-chain breathers, which can be considered as bound states of discrete breathers with different symmetry and center locations in the coupled chains, and bifurcation of the anti-phase two-chain breather into the one-chain one. Delocalizing transition of 1D breather in 2D system of a large number of parallel coupled nonlinear chains is described, in which the breather, initially excited in a given chain, abruptly spreads its vibration energy in the whole 2D system upon decreasing breather frequency or amplitude below the threshold one. The threshold breather frequency is above the cut off phonon frequency in 2D system, and the threshold breather amplitude scales as square root of the inter-chain coupling constant. Delocalizing transition of discrete vibrational breather in 2D and 3D systems of coupled nonlinear chains has an analogy with delocalizing transition for Bose-Einstein condensates in 2D and 3D optical lattices.

Aims: To characterize the behaviour and hence the nature of the source through temporal and spectral IBIS analysis. Methods: Detailed spectral and temporal analysis has been performed using standard INTEGRAL software OSA v.5.1. Results: To date, IGR J11321-5311 has been detected only once.

We find the H-alpha correlated component to be consistent with zero for each region, and we find that addition of an H-alpha correlated component in modeling the foreground emission has negligible effect on derived CIB results. Our CIB detections and 2 sigma upper limits are essentially the same as those derived by Hauser et al. and are given by nu I_nu (nW m-2 sr-1) < 75, < 32, 25 +- 8, and 13 +- 3 at 60, 100, 140, and 240 microns, respectively. Our residuals have not been subjected to a detailed anisotropy test, so our CIB results do not supersede those of Hauser et al. We derive upper limits on the 100 micron emissivity of the ionized medium that are typically about 40% of the 100 micron emissivity of the neutral atomic medium. This low value may be caused in part by a lower dust-to-gas mass ratio in the ionized medium than in the neutral medium, and in part by a shortcoming of using H-alpha intensity as a tracer of far infrared emission.

Since 802.11 WLAN capacity is shared between flows belonging to all stations, admission control requires knowledge of all flows in the WLAN. Further, estimation of the load-dependent WLAN capacity through analytical model requires inputs about channel data rate, payload size and the number of stations. These factors combined point to a centralized admission control whereas for 802.11 DCF it is ideally performed in a distributed manner. The use of measurements from the channel avoids explicit inputs about the state of the channel described above. BUFFET, a model based measurement-assisted distributed admission control scheme for DCF proposed in this paper relies on measurements to derive model inputs and predict WLAN saturation, thereby maintaining average delay within acceptable limits. Being measurement based, it adapts to a combination of data rates and payload sizes, making it completely autonomous and distributed.

Our scheme uses a novel combination of analytical models and machine learning techniques to predict the network's future load and make optimal admission control decisions. Simulation results demonstrate that our scheme significantly improves network throughput, reduces packet loss, and enhances overall network performance.

We review the hardware, the calibration and imaging strategies, comparing them to those at higher frequencies, including aspects of interference excision and wide-field imaging. Ionospheric phase fluctuations pose the major difficulty in calibrating the array. Over restricted fields of view or at times of extremely quiescent ionospheric ``weather'', an angle-invariant calibration strategy can be used. In this approach a single phase correction is devised for each antenna, typically via self-calibration. Over larger fields of view or at times of more normal ionospheric ``weather'' when the ionospheric isoplanatic patch size is smaller than the field of view, we adopt a field-based strategy in which the phase correction depends upon location within the field of view. This second calibration strategy was implemented by modeling the ionosphere above the array using Zernike polynomials.

The key assumptions are that the turbulence is anisotropic with respect to the mean magnetic field and frequencies are low compared to the ion cyclotron frequency. The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted into heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC CASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and velocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of the physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically reduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above the ion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic fluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional and collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations, which obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated with the Alfvenic component. In the \"dissipation range\" between the ion and electron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave (KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive phase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the energy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless wave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the phase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the electron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling relations are derived for these cascades.

Overall, our work demonstrates the potential of using chains of submicron-sized Co hollow spheres as a platform for studying magnetization reversal and anisotropy in nanoscale magnetic systems."}

The results showed good agreement with the observed flat rotation curves of galaxies and the Pioneer Anomaly. This analysis did not require the modification of Newtonian dynamics, but rather only their restatement in a five dimensional framework. The same analysis derived a acceleration parameter ar, which plays an important role in the restated equations of orbital dynamics, and suggested a value for ar. In this companion paper, the principle of conservation of energy is restated within the same five-dimensional framework. The resulting analysis provides an alternative route to estimating the value of ar, without reference to the equations of orbital dynamics, and based solely on key cosmological constants and parameters, including the gravitational constant, G. The same analysis suggests that: (i) the inverse square law of gravity may itself be due to the conservation of energy at the boundary between a four-dimensional universe and a fifth large-scale space-time dimension; and (ii) there is a limiting case for the Tulley-Fisher relationship linking the speed of light to the mass of the Universe.

In addition, the vertical separation between the signals in the two components is calculated from the Stokes velocity response functions.   Results: The inversion yields two atmospheric components, one permeated by a nearly horizontal magnetic field, the other with a less-inclined magnetic field.

These are compared to expected path lengths obtained from response functions of the observed spectral lines in the different atmospheric components.

We calculate `star formation rate functions' in four different redshift slices, splitting also into contributions from the red sequence and blue cloud for the first time.

The model is based on height-integrated hydrodynamic equations, alpha-viscosity, and a pseudo-Newtonian potential that results in an innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) that closely approximates the one predicted by GR. We find that the hydrodynamic models exhibit increasing deviations from the standard disk model of Shakura & Sunyaev as disk thickness H/R or the value of alpha increases. The latter is an analytical model in which the viscous torque is assumed to vanish at the ISCO. We consider the implications of the results for attempts to estimate black hole spin by using the standard disk model to fit continuum spectra of black hole accretion disks. We find that the error in the spin estimate is quite modest so long as H/R < 0.1 and alpha < 0.2. At worst the error in the estimated value of the spin parameter is 0.1 for a non-spinning black hole; the error is much less for a rapidly spinning hole. We also consider the density and disk thickness contrast between the gas in the disk and that inside the ISCO. The contrast needs to be large if black hole spin is to be successfully estimated by fitting the relativistically-broadened X-ray line profile of fluorescent iron emission from reflection off an accretion disk. In our hydrodynamic models, the contrast in density and thickness is low when H/R>0.1, sugesting that the iron line technique may be most reliable in extemely thin disks.

Assuming a power-law accretion disc and using constraints on the disc parameters derived from observational data, we have analyzed the relativistic Bardeen-Petterson effect driven by a Kerr black hole as the potential physical mechanism responsible for the disc warping. We found that the Bardeen-Petterson radius is comparable to or smaller than the inner radius of the maser disc (independent of the allowed value for the black hole spin parameter). Numerical simulations for a wide range of physical conditions have shown that the evolution of a misaligned disc due to the Bardeen-Petterson torques usually produces an inner flat disc and a warped transition region with a smooth gradient in the tilt and twist angles. Since this structure is similar to that seen in NGC 4258, we propose that the Bardeen-Petterson effect may be responsible for the disc warping in this galaxy. We estimated the time-scale necessary for the disc inside of the Bardeen-Petterson radius to align with the black hole's equator, as a function of the black hole spin. Our results show that the Bardeen-Petterson effect can align the disc within a few billion years in the case of NGC 4258.

We review here different methods to characterize this activity and its impact on spike generation. The simplified, fluctuating point-conductance model of synaptic activity provides the starting point of a variety of methods for the analysis of intracellular Vm recordings. In this model, the synaptic excitatory and inhibitory conductances are described by Gaussian-distributed stochastic variables, or colored conductance noise. The matching of experimentally recorded Vm distributions to an invertible theoretical expression derived from the model allows the extraction of parameters characterizing the synaptic conductance distributions. This analysis can be complemented by the matching of experimental Vm power spectral densities (PSDs) to a theoretical template, even though the unexpected scaling properties of experimental PSDs limit the precision of this latter approach. Building on this stochastic characterization of synaptic activity, we also propose methods to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate spike-triggered averages of synaptic time-courses preceding spikes. This analysis points to an essential role for synaptic conductance variance in determining spike times. The presented methods are evaluated using controlled conductance injection in cortical neurons in vitro with the dynamic-clamp technique.

It is however well known that the dynamics of the magnetic field is linked to that of the velocity field in the core and any attempt to model secular variations will involve a coupled dynamical system for magnetic field and core velocity. Unfortunately, there is no direct observation of the velocity. Independently of the exact nature of the above-mentioned coupled system -- some version being currently under construction -- the question is debated in this paper whether good knowledge of the magnetic field can be translated into good knowledge of core dynamics. Furthermore, what will be the impact of the most recent and precise geomagnetic data on our knowledge of the geomagnetic field of the past and future? These questions are cast into the language of variational data assimilation, while the dynamical system considered in this paper consists in a set of two oversimplified one-dimensional equations for magnetic and velocity fields. This toy model retains important features inherited from the induction and Navier-Stokes equations: non-linear magnetic and momentum terms are present and its linear response to small disturbances contains Alfv\\'en waves. It is concluded that variational data assimilation is indeed appropriate in principle, even though the velocity field remains hidden at all times; it allows us to recover the entire evolution of both fields from partial and irregularly distributed information on the magnetic field.

Our results indicate that the 5q state is bound and has a mass of approximately 3.3 GeV, significantly below the open charm threshold. We also find that the 5q state decays predominantly into two-body channels, with the dominant decay mode being πππ. Our findings provide new insights into the hadronic structure of five-quark systems and shed light on the role of hadronic molecules in the strong interaction. The results are discussed in the context of recent experimental searches for exotic hadrons and the prospects for future studies."}

The sources have 2-4.5 keV X-ray flux >= 10^-14 cgs, and in this paper we examine a subsample of 42 optically bright (r < 21) sources; this subsample is 100 per cent spectroscopically identified. All but one of the optical counterparts are extragalactic, and we argue that the single exception, a Galactic M star, is probably a coincidental association. The X-ray spectra are consistent with heavily absorbed power laws (21.8 < log NH < 23.4), and all of them appear to be absorbed AGN. The majority of the sources show only narrow emission lines in their optical spectra, implying that they are type-2 AGN. Only a small fraction of the sources (7/42) show broad optical emission lines, and all of these have NH < 10^23 cm^-2. This implies that ratios of X-ray absorption to optical/UV extinction equivalent to > 100 times the Galactic gas-to-dust ratio are rare in AGN absorbers (at most a few percent of the population), and may be restricted to broad absorption-line QSOs. Seven objects appear to have an additional soft X-ray component in addition to the heavily absorbed power law. We consider the implications of our results in the light of the AGN unified scheme. We find that the soft components in narrow-line objects are consistent with the unified scheme provided that > 4 per cent of broad-line AGN have ionised absorbers that attenuate their soft X-ray flux by >50 per cent. In at least one of the X-ray absorbed, broad-line AGN in our sample the X-ray spectrum requires an ionised absorber, consistent with this picture.

We measure three different types of spatial alignment: halo alignment between the orientation of the group central substructure (GCS) and the distribution of its satellites, radial alignment between the orientation of a satellite and the direction towards its GCS, and direct alignment between the orientation of the GCS and that of its satellites. In analogy we use the directions of satellite velocities and probe three further types of alignment: the radial velocity alignment between the satellite velocity and connecting line between satellite and GCS, the halo velocity alignment between the orientation of the GCS and satellite velocities and the auto velocity alignment between the satellites orientations and their velocities. We find that satellites are preferentially located along the major axis of the GCS within at least 6 Rvir (the range probed here). Furthermore, satellites preferentially point towards the GCS. The most pronounced signal is detected on small scales but a detectable signal extends out to 6 Rvir. The direct alignment signal is weaker, however a systematic trend is visible at distances < 2 Rvir. All velocity alignments are highly significant on small scales. Our results suggest that the halo alignment reflects the filamentary large scale structure which extends far beyond the virial radii of the groups. In contrast, the main contribution to the radial alignment arises from the adjustment of the satellite orientations in the group tidal field.

It respects the analog of the Birkhoff theorem, i.e., the vacuum spherically symmetric solution is necessarily static. As in general relativity, the spherically symmetric solution is seen to describe a black hole. The exterior geometry is essentially the same as in the Schwarzschild case, with power-law corrections to the Newtonian potential. The behavior inside the black-hole region is different from the Schwarzschild case in that the usual spacetime singularity gets replaced by a singular surface of a new type, where all basic fields of the theory remain finite but metric ceases to exist. The theory does not admit arbitrarily small black holes: for small objects, the curvature on the would-be horizon is so strong that non-metric modifications prevent the horizon from being formed. The theory allows for modifications of gravity of very interesting nature. We discuss three physical effects, namely, (i) correction to Newton's law in the neighborhood of the source, (ii) renormalization of effective gravitational and cosmological constants at large distances from the source, and (iii) additional redshift factor between spatial regions of different curvature. The first two effects can be responsible, respectively, for the observed anomaly in the acceleration of the Pioneer spacecraft and for the alleged missing mass in spiral galaxies and other astrophysical objects.

As young AGN (quasars) they are initially several magnitudes sub-luminous to mature galaxies but their luminosity gradually increases over 10^8 yrs, as z_(i) decreases and they evolve into mature AGN (Seyferts and radio galaxies). Evidence presented here that low- and intermediate-redshift AGN are unquestionably sub-luminous to radio galaxies is then strong support for this model and makes it likely that the high-redshift AGN (quasars) are also sub-luminous, having simply been pushed above the radio galaxies on a logz-m_(v) plot by the presence of a large intrinsic component in their redshifts. An increase in luminosity below z = 0.06 is also seen. It is associated in the DIR model with an increase in luminosity as the sources mature but, if real, is difficult to interpret in the cosmological redshift (CR) model since at this low redshift it is unlikely to be associated with a higher star formation rate or an increase in the material used to build galaxies.

These AGN inflate buoyant bubbles containing non-thermal radio emitting particles. If such bubbles efficiently confine cosmic rays (CR) then this could explain ``radio ghosts'' seen far from cluster centers. We simulate the diffusion of cosmic rays from buoyant bubbles inflated by AGN. Our simulations include the effects of the anisotropic particle diffusion introduced by magnetic fields. Our models are consistent with the X-ray morphology of AGN bubbles, with disruption being suppressed by the magnetic draping effect. We conclude that for such magnetic field topologies, a substantial fraction of cosmic rays can be confined inside the bubbles on buoyant rise timescales even when the parallel diffusivity coefficient is very large. For isotropic diffusion at a comparable level, cosmic rays would leak out of the bubbles too rapidly to be consistent with radio observations. Thus, the long confinement times associated with the magnetic suppression of CR diffusion can explain the presence of radio ghosts. We show that the partial escape of cosmic rays is mostly confined to the wake of the rising bubbles, and speculate that this effect could: (1) account for the excitation of the H$\\alpha$ filaments trailing behind the bubbles in the Perseus cluster, (2) inject entropy into the metal enriched material being lifted by the bubbles and, thus, help to displace it permanently from the cluster center and (3) produce observable $\\gamma$-rays via the interaction of the diffusing cosmic rays with the thermal intracluster medium (ICM).

However, the derived parameters are often extreme, both in terms of the underlying spacetime and the reflection geometry, and these models require that the disc is far from hydrostatic equilibrium. An alternative model uses similarly partially ionised, velocity smeared material but seen in absorption, though again the derived velocities are extreme, requiring magnetic driving (in the jet?) rather than a simple line driven disc wind. We find that while both models give comparably good fits to XMM--Newton data, we favour the absorption model as, unlike reflection, all the derived spectral indices are soft. This is as expected by analogy with the correspondingly high mass accretion rate stellar mass black holes. Furthermore, these X-ray spectra are consistent with a one--to--one mapping between AGN type and spectral state, with NLS1's having softer spectra corresponding to the very high state, while the broad line AGN have Gamma~2 as expected for the high/soft state. We also use the simultaneous OM data to derive the ratio of disc to total accretion power which is another tracer of spectral state in X-ray binaries. This does not always show that the disc in NLS1's contributes less than 80 per cent of the total power, as expected for a very high state. We suggest that this is an artifact of the standard disc models used to determine the disc luminosity in our fits. The disc seen in the very high state of black hole binaries is often observed to be distorted from the standard shape, and a similar effect in NLS1's could recover the correspondance between black hole binary spectral state and AGN type.

Even if only a single initial level is appreciably populated, initial levels with small populations can still give major contributions to the unknown vibrational state, making it essential to take them into account. In addition to the excitation pulse, the method uses two incident, short laser pulses in a non-co-linear geometry to create four-wave mixing in the molecules. The measurements used in the reconstruction are spectra of the outgoing four-wave mixing pulse at different time delays of the excitation laser pulse. An important point is that the method does not require detailed knowledge of molecular transition moments between excited states nor of any of the incoming laser pulses, but circumvents this requirement by using one or more calibration laser pulses in a separate experiment either before or after the main data are recorded. The only requirements for the calibration laser pulses are that the constant parts of their spectrums should together cover the spectral range of the excitation laser pulse, and the constant part of each should have sufficient spectral overlap with one other calibration pulse to populate two of the same levels.

This approximation is capable of describing the limited available space for species occupancy. The pair approximation is moreover able to describe two types of coexistence of prey and predators: one where population densities are constant in time and another displaying self-sustained time-oscillations of the population densities. The oscillations are associated with limit cycles and arise through a Hopf bifurcation.

We present HMMER-STRUCT, a model construction algorithm and tool that tries to improve pHMM performance by using structural information while training pHMMs. As a first step, HMMER-STRUCT constructs a set of pHMMs. Each pHMM is constructed by weighting each residue in an aligned protein according to a specific structural property of the residue. Properties used were primary, secondary and tertiary structures, accessibility and packing. HMMER-STRUCT then prioritizes the results by voting. Results: We used the SCOP database to perform our experiments. Throughout, we apply leave-one-family-out cross-validation over protein superfamilies.

This effect originates from the change of the shape of the vortex core due to non-equilibrium effects (similar to the mechanism of vortex motion instability in the Larkin-Ovchinnikov theory). The moving vortex creates a deficit of quasiparticles in front of its motion and an excess of quasiparticles behind the core of the moving vortex. This results in the appearance of a wake (region with suppressed order parameter) behind the vortex which attracts other vortices resulting in an effective direction-dependent interaction between vortices. When the vortex velocity $v$ reaches the critical value $v_c$ quasi-phase slip lines (lines with fast vortex motion) appear which may coexist with slowly moving vortices between such lines. Our results are found within the framework of the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations and are strictly valid when the coherence length $\\xi(T)$ is larger or comparable with the decay length $L_{in}$ of the non-equilibrium quasiparticle distribution function. We qualitatively explain experiments on the instability of vortex flow at low magnetic fields when the distance between vortices $a \\gg L_{in} \\gg \\xi (T)$.

In the present paper we first study the effect of orientational order on depletion forces in this particular binary system, comparing our results with those obtained adopting the usual approximation of considering the rods parallel and their orientations frozen. We consider mixtures with rods of different aspect ratios and spheres of different diameters, and we treat them within Onsager theory. Our results indicate that depletion effects, and consequently smectic stability, decrease significantly as a result of orientational disorder in the smectic phase when compared with corresponding data based on the frozen--orientation approximation. These results are discussed in terms of the $\\tau$ parameter, which has been proposed as a convenient measure of depletion strength. We present closed expressions for $\\tau$, and show that it is intimately connected with the depletion potential. We then analyse the effect of particle geometry by comparing results pertaining to systems of parallel rods of different shapes (spherocylinders, cylinders and parallelepipeds). We finally provide results based on the Zwanzig approximation of a Fundamental--Measure density--functional theory applied to mixtures of parallelepipeds and cubes of different sizes. In this case, we show that the $\\tau$ parameter exhibits a linear asymptotic behaviour in the limit of large values of the hard--rod aspect ratio, in conformity with Onsager theory, as well as in the limit of large values of the ratio of rod breadth to cube side length, $d$, in contrast to Onsager approximation, which predicts $\\tau\\sim d^3$.

We find that this emerging market exhibits strong correlations in the movement of stock prices compared to developed markets, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). This is shown to be due to the dominant influence of a common market mode on the stock prices. By comparison, interactions between related stocks, e.g., those belonging to the same business sector, are much weaker. This lack of distinct sector identity in emerging markets is explicitly shown by reconstructing the network of mutually interacting stocks. Spectral analysis of C for NSE reveals that, the few largest eigenvalues deviate from the bulk of the spectrum predicted by random matrix theory, but they are far fewer in number compared to, e.g., NYSE. We show this to be due to the relative weakness of intra-sector interactions between stocks, compared to the market mode, by modeling stock price dynamics with a two-factor model.

In star-forming environments, enhanced cooling can potentially lead to fragmentation and the formation of low-mass stars, where metal-free gas-clouds have been shown not to fragment. Adding metal cooling to numerical simulations has traditionally required a choice between speed and accuracy. We introduce a method that uses the sophisticated chemical network of the photoionization software, Cloudy, to include radiative cooling from a complete set of metals up to atomic number 30 (Zn) that can be used with large-scale three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. Our method is valid over an extremely large temperature range (10 K < T < 10^8 K), up to hydrogen number densities of 10^12 cm^-3. At this density, a sphere of 1 Msun has a radius of roughly 40 AU. We implement our method in the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) hydrodynamic/N-body code, Enzo. Using cooling rates generated with this method, we study the physical conditions that led to the transition from Population III to Population II star formation. While C, O, Fe, and Si have been previously shown to make the strongest contribution to the cooling in low-metallicity gas, we find that up to 40% of the metal cooling comes from fine-structure emission by S, when solar abundance patterns are present. At metallicities, Z > 10^-4 Zsun, regions of density and temperature exist where gas is both thermally unstable and has a cooling time less than its dynamical time. We identify these doubly unstable regions as the most inducive to fragmentation. At high redshifts, the CMB inhibits efficient cooling at low temperatures and, thus, reduces the size of the doubly unstable regions, making fragmentation more difficult.

This refutes previous claims of large timing irregularities in these data. In the dipole spin-down formalism, the 2-sigma upper limit on period derivative implies an energy loss rate < 1.5E32 ergs/s, surface magnetic field strength B_p < 3.5E11 G, and characteristic age tau > 24 Myr. This tau exceeds the remnant age by 3 orders of magnitude, requiring that the pulsar was born spinning at its present period. The X-ray luminosity of 1E 1207.4-5209, L(bol) ~= 2E33 ergs/s at 2 kpc, exceeds its spin-down energy loss, implying that L(bol) derives from residual cooling, and perhaps partly from accretion of supernova debris. The upper limit on B_p is small enough to favor the electron cyclotron model for at least one of the prominent absorption lines in its soft X-ray spectrum.

Searching for planets in open clusters allows us to study the effects of dynamical environment on planet formation and evolution.   Aims. Considering the strong dependence of planet frequency on stellar metallicity, we studied the metal rich old open cluster NGC 6791 and searched for close-in planets using the transit technique.   Methods. A ten-night observational campaign was performed using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (3.6m), the San Pedro M\\'artir telescope (2.1m), and the Loiano telescope (1.5m). To increase the transit detection probability we also made use of the Bruntt et al. (2003) eight-nights observational campaign. Adequate photometric precision for the detection of planetary transits was achieved.   Results. Should the frequency and properties of close-in planets in NGC 6791 be similar to those orbiting field stars of similar metallicity, then detailed simulations foresee the presence of 2-3 transiting planets. Instead, we do not confirm the transit candidates proposed by Bruntt et al. (2003). The probability that the null detection is simply due to chance coincidence is estimated to be 3%-10%, depending on the metallicity assumed for the cluster.   Conclusions. Possible explanations of the null-detection of transits include: (i) a lower frequency of close-in planets in star clusters; (ii) a smaller planetary radius for planets orbiting super metal rich stars; or (iii) limitations in the basic assumptions.

Here we present an integrated experimental and theoretical framework to understand and quantitatively predict how and when information spreads over social networks. Using data collected in Viral Marketing campaigns that reached over 31,000 individuals in eleven European markets, we show the large degree of variability of the participants' actions, despite them being confronted with the common task of receiving and forwarding the same piece of information. This have a profound effect on information diffusion: Firstly, most of the transmission takes place due to super-spreading events which would be considered extraordinary in population-average models. Secondly, due to the different way individuals schedule information transmission we observe a slowing down of the spreading of information in social networks that happens in logarithmic time. Quantitative description of the experiments is possible through an stochastic branching process which corroborates the importance of heterogeneity. Since high variability of both the intensity and frequency of human responses are found in many other activities, our findings are pertinent to many other human driven diffusion processes like rumors, fads, innovations or news which has important consequences for organizations management, communications, marketing or electronic social communities.

For the one and the few particle cases the flux decreases with increasing delay, as an effect of the decorrelation of the present state of the system with the information that the controller uses, but the delayed closed-loop protocol succeeds to perform better than its open-loop counterpart provided the delays are smaller than the characteristic times of the Brownian ratchet. For the many particle case, we also show that for small delays the center-of-mass velocity decreases for increasing delays. However, for large delays we find the surprising result that the presence of the delay can improve the performance of the nondelayed feedback ratchet and the flux can attain the maximum value obtained with the optimal periodic protocol. This phenomenon is the result of the emergence of a dynamical regime where the presence of the delayed feedback stabilizes one quasiperiodic solution or several (multistability), which resemble the solutions obtained in the so-called threshold protocol.

In Corbino geometry two Ohmic contacts have to be made on the film evaporating Ag or using silver paste: one circle with radius r_a (1) and a ring electrode with internal radius r_b (2). In the in-between space (r_a,r_b) a ring electrode from mylar assures a capacitive connection between the superconducting layer and the metallized surface (3) of the mylar. In such a way we have an field effect transistor (FET) type structure with a circular gate.

The 2f signal depends on Cooper pair effective mass and its systematic investigation gives a Cooper pair mass spectroscopy.

This is the first clear detection of emission from this radical at high redshift. CN emission is a tracer of dense molecular hydrogen gas (n(H2) > 10^4 cm^{-3}) within star-forming molecular clouds, in particular in regions where the clouds are affected by UV radiation. The HCN/CN intensity ratio can be used as a diagnostic for the relative importance of photodissociation regions (PDRs) in a source, and as a sensitive probe of optical depth, the radiation field, and photochemical processes. We derive a lensing-corrected CN(N=3-2) line luminosity of L'(CN(3-2) = (4.5 +/- 0.5) x 10^9 K km/s pc^2. The ratio between CN luminosity and far-infrared luminosity falls within the scatter of the same relationship found for low-z (ultra-) luminous infrared galaxies. Combining our new results with CO(J=3-2) and HCN(J=1-0) measurements from the literature and assuming thermal excitation for all transitions, we find a CO/CN luminosity ratio of 9.3 +/- 1.9 and a HCN/CN luminosity ratio of 0.95 +/- 0.15. However, we find that the CN(N=3-2) line is likely only subthermally excited, implying that those ratios may only provide upper limits for the intrinsic 1-0 line luminosity ratios.

Recent studies have confirmed that a system consisting of a flux rope embedded in a background field exhibits a catastrophic behavior, and the energy threshold at the catastrophic point may exceed the associated open field energy. The accumulated free energy in the corona is abruptly released when the catastrophe takes place, and it probably serves as the main means of energy release for CMEs at least in the initial phase. Such a release proceeds via an ideal MHD process in contrast with nonideal ones such as magnetic reconnection. The catastrophe results in a sudden formation of electric current sheets, which naturally provide proper sites for fast magnetic reconnection. The reconnection may be identified with a solar flare associated with the CME on one hand, and produces a further acceleration of the CME on the other.

By inverting single-stellar population models, luminosity-weighted mean ages, metallicities and alpha-element abundance ratios are derived. We estimate the amount of fading a galaxy has undergone by comparing each galaxy's S_N with its deviation from the mean spiral S_N. Galaxies with higher S_N have older stellar populations. Moreover, we find that the zero-point and amount of fading is consistent with a scenario where lenticulars are formed by the quenching of star formation in spiral galaxies. Our data also rule out any formation method for S0s which creates a large number of new globular clusters. We confirm that previous results showing a relationship between S_N and color are driven by the S_N - Age relation. Five galaxies show detectable Hbeta, [OIII], Halpha or [NII] emission lines. However, only in the two youngest galaxies is this emission unambiguously from star formation. Our results are consistent with the theory that S0 galaxies are formed when gas in normal spirals is removed, possibly as a result of a change in environment.

In Paper I of this series, we showed for three DLA galaxies that we can derive their star formation histories and ages from a detailed comparison of their intrinsic abundance patterns with chemical evolution models. We determine in this paper the star formation properties of six additional DLA galaxies. The derived results confirm that no single star formation history explains the diverse sets of abundance patterns in DLAs. We demonstrate that the various star formation histories reproducing the DLA abundance patterns are typical of local irregular, dwarf starburst and quiescent spiral galaxies. Independent of the star formation history, the DLAs have a common characteristic of being weak star forming galaxies; models with high star formation efficiencies are ruled out. All the derived DLA star formation rates per unit area are moderate or low, with values between -3.2 < log SFR < -1.1 M_sol yr^{-1} kpc^{-2}. The DLA abundance patterns require a large spread in ages ranging from 20 Myr up to 3 Gyr. The oldest DLA in our sample is observed at z_DLA=1.864 with an age estimated to more than 3 Gyr; it nicely indicates that galaxies were already forming at z_f>10. But, most of the DLAs show ages much younger than that of the Universe at the epoch of observation. Young galaxies thus seem to populate the high redshift Universe at z>2, suggesting relatively low redshifts of formation (z~3) for most high-redshift galaxies.

Overall subhalos are more spherical than the host halo, with minor to major and intermediate to major axis ratios of 0.68 and 0.83, respectively. Like isolated halos, subhalos tend to be less spherical in their central regions. The principal axis ratios are independent of subhalo mass, when the shapes are measured within a physical scale like r_Vmax, the radius of the peak of the circular velocity curve. Subhalos tend to be slightly more spherical closer to the host halo center. The spatial distribution of the subhalos traces the prolate shape of the host halo when they are selected by the largest V_max they ever had, i.e. before they experienced strong tidal mass loss. The subhalos' orientation is not random: the major axis tends to align with the direction towards the host halo center. This alignment disappears for halos beyond 3 r_200 and is more pronounced when the shapes are measured in the outer regions of the subhalos. The radial alignment is preserved during a subhalo's orbit and they become elongated during pericenter passage, indicating that the alignment is likely caused by the host halo's tidal forces. These tidal interactions with the host halo act to make subhalos rounder over time.

It is shown that, if the zero point energies for the cosmic microwave background and for all the rest of the universe that is not cosmic microwave background are introduced into this model as two entities, their separate values appear within this theory in the form of a numerical difference. It is this difference that gives the numerical value for the zero point value of Einstein's dark energy density. Consequently, although the two zero point energies may be large, their difference can give the known small dark energy value from cosmology for dark energy density. Issues relating to interpretation, calculation and measurement associated with this result and an interpretation of dark energy as a measure of polarisation of the vacuum are discussed. In the first appendix to this paper, problems associated with the standard model of cosmology are solved by redefining temperature in the dust universe model. In the second appendix of this paper, an examination of the dark matter problem in relation to a general relativistic generalisation of Newton's inverse square law is undertaken. In the third appendix to this paper, the formalism is used to derive a formula that gives a possible value for the mass of the universe in terms of Newton's gravitation constant, Einstein's Lambda and the velocity of light.

In the cases of no atmospheric effects, the light curves contain the information of the black hole spin because most of the X-ray photons around 1 keV usually come from the blueshifted part of the accretion flow near the black hole shadow, and the size and the position of the black hole shadow depend on the spin. In these cases, when most of the emission comes from the vicinity of the event horizon, the light curves become asymmetric at ingress and egress. We next investigate the atmospheric absorption and scattering effects of the companion stars. By using the solar-type atmospheric model, we have taken into account the atmospheric effects of the companion star, such as the photoionization by HI and HeI. We found that the eclipsing light curves observed at 1 keV possibly contain the information of the black hole spin. However, in our atmospheric model, the effects of the atmosphere are much larger than the effects of the black hole spin. Therefore, even in the case that the light curves contain the information of the black hole spin, it may be difficult to extract the information of the black hole spin if we do not have the realistic atmospheric profiles, such as the temperature, and the number densities for several elements. Even in such cases, the light-curve asymmetries due to the rotation of the accretion disc exist. Only when we have the reliable atmospheric model, in principle, the information of the strong-gravity regions, such as the black hole spin, can be obtained from the eclipsing light curves.

The phase diagram is studied as a function of the amplitude of the attraction for a certain fixed amplitude of the long ranged repulsion. We find that the effect of the repulsion is to substitute the liquid-vapor critical point and a portion of the associated liquid-vapor transition line, by two first order transitions. One of these transitions separates the vapor from a fluid of spherical liquidlike clusters; the other separates the liquid from a fluid of spherical voids. At low temperature, the two transition lines intersect one another and a vapor-liquid transition line at a triple point.

Since our own Universe is supposed to be of this kind, bubble cosmology should supply definite answers to the long-standing questions regarding cosmological initial conditions. In particular, it must explain how an initial singularity is avoided, and also how the initial conditions for Inflation were established. We argue that the simplest non-anthropic approach to these problems involves a requirement that the spatial sections defined by distinguished bubble observers should not be allowed to have arbitrarily small volumes. Casimir energy is a popular candidate for a quantum effect which can ensure this, but [because it violates energy conditions] there is a danger that it could lead to non-perturbative instabilities in string theory. We make a simple proposal for the initial conditions of a bubble universe, and show that our proposal ensures that the system is non-perturbatively stable.

We show that the Casimir force, which arises from the fluctuations of the electromagnetic field in vacuum, can generate a repulsive force between two parallel plates. By applying this force to the universe as a whole, we find that it can drive the acceleration of the universe's expansion.

Over a period of three months, the Cassini Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) observed a dramatic variation in the average torus composition. Superimposed on this long-term variation, is a 10.07-hour periodicity caused by an azimuthal variation in plasma composition subcorotating relative to System III longitude. Quite surprisingly, the amplitude of the azimuthal variation appears to be modulated at the beat frequency between the System III period and the observed 10.07-hour period. Previously, we have successfully modeled the months-long compositional change by supposing a factor of three increase in the amount of material supplied to Io's extended neutral clouds. Here, we extend our torus chemistry model to include an azimuthal dimension. We postulate the existence of two azimuthal variations in the number of super-thermal electrons in the torus: a primary variation that subcorotates with a period of 10.07 hours and a secondary variation that remains fixed in System III longitude. Using these two hot electron variations, our model can reproduce the observed temporal and azimuthal variations observed by Cassini UVIS.

This molecular noise can give rise to behavior that is very different from the predictions of deterministic rate equation models. Unfortunately, there are few analytic methods for examining the qualitative behavior of stochastic systems. Here we describe such a method that extends deterministic analysis to include leading-order corrections due to the molecular noise. The method allows the steady-state behavior of the stochastic model to be easily computed, facilitates the mapping of stability phase diagrams that include stochastic effects and reveals how model parameters affect noise susceptibility, in a manner not accessible to numerical simulation. By way of illustration we consider two genetic circuits: a bistable positive-feedback loop and a negative-feedback oscillator. We find in the positive feedback circuit that translational activation leads to a far more stable system than transcriptional control.

A pure fluid of hard rectangles may exhibit, aside from the usual uniaxial nematic phase, an additional (tetratic) oriented phase, possessing two directors, which is the analogue of the biaxial or cubatic phases in three- dimensional fluids. There is computer simulation evidence that the tetratic phase might be stable with respect to phases with spatial order for rectangles with low aspect ratios. As hard rectangles are mixed with other particles not possessing stable tetratic order by themselves, the tetratic phase is destabilised, via a first- or second-order phase transition, to uniaxial nematic or isotropic phases; for hard rectangles of low aspect ratio tetratic order persists in a relatively large range of volume fractions. The order of these transitions depends on the particle geometry, dimensions and thermodynamic conditions of the mixture. The second component of the mixture has been chosen to be hard discs or disco-rectangles, the geometry of which is different from that of rectangles, leading to packing frustration and demixing behaviour, or simply rectangles of different aspect ratio. These mixtures may be good candidates for observing thermodynamically stable tetratic phases in monolayers of hard particles.

The current QM to tell us that \"... the state of a system can be instantaneously changed by a distant measurement >...\" cannot be treated as a physical theory. Its key statements - that the EPR-Bell experiments to violate Bell's inequality verify nonlocality, and nonlocal correlations respect special relativity - are false. Both the EPR-Bell experiments and theorems to support the \"non-signalling principle\" are based on the implicit assumption that all quantum postulates and, in particular, Born's averaging rule are fully applicable to Cat states. However, this is not the case. Introducing observables (e.g., correlations) for Cat states violates the correspondence principle. Pure (macro- and micro-)Cat states must be governed both by the PMRs and superposition principle. Our (macrorealistic) model of a one-dimensional completed scattering shows how these principles coexist with each other, in the case of a one-electron micro-Cat state.

Our approach starts from the observation that quantum mechanics is a probabilistic theory, and that the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics can be understood as a reflection of the inherent uncertainty principle, rather than a fundamental randomness. We demonstrate that this perspective leads to a natural and consistent macrorealistic theory, which posits that the wave function collapse is an emergent phenomenon arising from the interactions between the system and its environment. Our theory provides a clear and coherent explanation for the observed macroscopic behavior of quantum systems, and resolves the apparent paradoxes and inconsistencies that have plagued the foundations of quantum mechanics. We achieve this by developing a novel mathematical framework, which incorporates the principles of quantum mechanics and the concept of macrorealism, and by using a combination of analytical and numerical methods to explore the implications of our theory. Our results show that the macrorealistic theory provides a more accurate and complete description of quantum phenomena, and offers a promising avenue for the development of a more comprehensive and consistent theory of quantum mechanics."}

Interpretation of our results and those published by others, based on polymer physics, shows that the folding of the chromatin fiber can be described as a polymer in a globular state (GS), maintained by intra-polymer attractive interactions that counteract self-avoidance forces. The GS polymer model is able to describe chromatin folding in as well the highly expressed domains as the lowly expressed ones, indicating that they differ in Kuhn length and chromatin compaction. Each type of genomic domain constitutes an ensemble of relatively compact globular folding states, resulting in a considerable cellto- cell variation between otherwise identical cells.

The grinding-induced defects enhance the contribution of the Pr 4f electrons to the superconducting gap, leading to a more prominent first transition.

Because AGN luminosity is likely to depend on Mbh, selection effects are different for high-redshift and local samples, potentially producing a false signal of evolution. This bias arises because cosmic scatter in the Mbh-sigma and Mbh-L relations means that the mean log(L) or log(sigma) among galaxies that host a black hole of given Mbh, may be substantially different than the log(L) or log(sigma) obtained from inverting the Mbh-L or Mbh-sigma relations for the same nominal Mbh. The bias is particularly strong at high Mbh, where the luminosity and dispersion functions of galaxies are falling rapidly. The most massive black holes occur more often as rare outliers in galaxies of modest mass than in the even rarer high-mass galaxies, which would otherwise be the sole location of such black holes in the absence of cosmic scatter. Because of this bias, Mbh will typically appear to be too large in the distant sample for a given L or sigma. For the largest black holes and the largest plausible cosmic scatter, the bias can reach a factor of 3 in Mbh for the Mbh-sigma relation and a factor of 9 for the Mbh-L relation. Unfortunately, the actual cosmic scatter is not known well enough to correct for the bias. Measuring evolution of the Mbh and galaxy property relations requires object selection to be precisely defined and exactly the same at all redshifts.

However, most Galactic WR stars are slow rotators, as stellar winds are thought to remove angular momentum. This poses a challenge to the collapsar model. Recent observations indicate that GRBs occur predominately in low metallicity (Z) environments, which may resolve the problem: lower Z leads to less mass loss, which may inhibit angular momentum removal, allowing WR stars to remain rotating rapidly until collapse. We wish to determine whether low Z WR stars rotate on average more rapidly than Galactic WR stars, and perform a Very Large Telescope (VLT) linear spectropolarimetry survey of WR stars in the low Z environment of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and compare our results with the Galactic sample. We find that only 2 out of 13 (i.e. 15%) of LMC WR stars show line polarization effects, compared to a similarly low fraction of ~15-20% for Galactic WR stars.

We employed a combination of classical Fourier analysis and the Lomb-Scargle periodogram to determine the periods and amplitudes of the variables. Our results reveal a significant improvement in period accuracy compared to previous studies, with a median uncertainty of 0.03 days. We also found evidence of secondary periods and non-linear period changes, which are discussed in the context of theoretical models of Mira variable evolution.

For a linear data model, a number of known and novel reconstruction schemes, which differ in terms of the underlying signal prior, data likelihood, and numerical inverse extra-regularization schemes are derived and classified. The Bayesian methodology presented in this paper tries to unify and extend the following methods: Wiener-filtering, Tikhonov regularization, Ridge regression, Maximum Entropy, and inverse regularization techniques. The inverse techniques considered here are the asymptotic regularization, the Jacobi, Steepest Descent, Newton-Raphson, Landweber-Fridman, and both linear and non-linear Krylov methods based on Fletcher-Reeves, Polak-Ribiere, and Hestenes-Stiefel Conjugate Gradients. The structures of the up-to-date highest-performing algorithms are presented, based on an operator scheme, which permits one to exploit the power of fast Fourier transforms. Using such an implementation of the generalized Wiener-filter in the novel ARGO-software package, the different numerical schemes are benchmarked with 1-, 2-, and 3-dimensional problems including structured white and Poissonian noise, data windowing and blurring effects. A novel numerical Krylov scheme is shown to be superior in terms of performance and fidelity. These fast inverse methods ultimately will enable the application of sampling techniques to explore complex joint posterior distributions. We outline how the space of the dark-matter density field, the peculiar velocity field, and the power spectrum can jointly be investigated by a Gibbs-sampling process. Such a method can be applied for the redshift distortions correction of the observed galaxies and for time-reversal reconstructions of the initial density field.

These simulations show that the pronounced inhomogeneous structuring of the fluid normal to the confining walls, often the primary focus of density functional theory studies, has a negligible effect on many of its average properties over a surprisingly broad range of conditions. We present one consequence of this insensitivity to confinement: a simple analytical equation relating the average density of the confined fluid to that of the bulk fluid with equal activity. Nontrivial implications of confinement for average fluid properties do emerge in this system, but only when the fluid is both (i) dense and (ii) confined to a gap smaller than approximately three particle diameters. For this limited set of conditions, we find that \"in-phase\" oscillatory deviations in excess entropy and self-diffusivity (relative to the behavior of the bulk fluid at the same average density) occur as a function of gap size.

It turns out that the structural properties of an alanine molecule in aqueous solution can differ significantly from those in crystalline phase, these differences being mainly attributed to hydrogen bonding interactions. In particular, we found that the largest difference between the two alanine forms can be seen for the orientation and bond lengths of the carboxylate (COO-) group: in aqueous solution the C-O bond lengths appear to strongly correlate with the number of water molecules which form hydrogen bonds with the COO- group. Furthermore, the hydrogen bond lengths are shorter and the hydrogen bond angles are larger for L-alanine in water as compared to crystal.

A number of theoretical approaches have been used for this problem (e.g., various numbers of coupled Stoner-Wohlfarth layers and continuum micromagnetics). In this paper we show that many of these approaches can be regarded as special cases or approximations to a variational formulation of the problem, in which the energy is minimized for fixed magnetization. The results can be easily visualized in terms of a plot of the energy as a function of magnetic moment m_z, in which both the switching field [the maximum slope of E(m_z)] and the stability (determined by the energy barrier E_b) are geometrically visible.

In this classification, the long bursts are further divided into two groups which are primarily differentiated by their total fluence and duration and hence are named low and high fluence GRB. Analysis of GRB with known red-shifts and spectral parameters suggests that low fluence GRB have nearly constant isotropic energy output of 10^{52} ergs while for the high fluence ones, the energy output ranges from 10^{52} to 10^{54} ergs. It is speculated that the three kinds of GRBs reflect three different origins: mergers of neutron star systems, mergers between white dwarfs and neutron stars, and collapse of massive stars.

Our results demonstrate that the traditionally defined short-hard and long-soft classes are robust, while the short-soft class is a previously overlooked population. We find that the short-soft GRBs have distinct temporal and spectral characteristics, including shorter durations and softer spectra, compared to the other two classes.

We find that both the SE and SED relations break down at low temperature. To explore the relationship between these breakdowns and dynamical heterogeneities (DH), we also calculate the SE and SED relations for subsets of the 7% ``fastest'' and 7% ``slowest'' molecules. We find that the SE and SED relations break down in both subsets, and that the breakdowns occur on all scales of mobility. Thus these breakdowns appear to be generalized phenomena, in contrast with the view where only the most mobile molecules are the origin of the breakdown of the SE and SED relations, embedded in an inactive background where these relations hold. At low temperature, the SE and SED relations in both subsets of molecules are replaced with ``fractional'' SE and SED relations, $D_t\\sim(\\tau/T)^{-\\xi_t}$ and $D_r\\sim(\\tau/T)^{-\\xi_r}$ where $\\xi_t\\approx0.84<1$ and $\\xi_r\\approx0.75<1$. We also find that there is a decoupling between rotational and translational motion, and that this decoupling occurs in both fastest and slowest subsets of molecules. We also find that when the decoupling increases, upon cooling, the probability of a molecule being classified as both translationally and rotationally fastest also increases. To study the effect of time scale for SE and SED breakdown and decoupling, we introduce a time-dependent version of the SE and SED relations, and a time-dependent function that measures the extent of decoupling. Our results suggest that both the decoupling and SE and SED breakdowns are originated at the time scale corresponding to the end of the cage regime, when diffusion starts. This is also the time scale when the DH are more relevant.

In particular, the contribution of X-ray Scattering (XRS) to the HEW of the optic is usually an increasing function H(E) of the photon energy E. Therefore, in future hard X-ray imaging telescopes of the future (SIMBOL-X, NeXT, Constellation-X, XEUS), the X-ray scattering could be the dominant problem since they will operate also in the hard X-ray band (i.e. beyond 10 keV). [...]   Several methods were proposed in the past years to estimate the scattering contribution to the HEW, dealing with the surface microroughness expressed in terms of its Power Spectral Density (PSD), on the basis of the well-established theory of X-ray scattering from rough surfaces. We faced that problem on the basis on the same theory, but we tried a new approach: the direct, analytical translation of a given surface roughness PSD into a H(E) trend, and - vice versa - the direct translation of a H(E) requirement into a surface PSD. This PSD represents the maximum tolerable microroughness level in order to meet the H(E) requirement in the energy band of a given X-ray telescope.   We have thereby found a new, analytical and widely applicable formalism to compute the XRS contribution to the HEW from the surface PSD, provided that the PSD had been measured in a wide range of spatial frequencies. The inverse problem was also solved, allowing the immediate evaluation of the mirror surface PSD from a measured function H(E). The same formalism allows establishing the maximum allowed PSD of the mirror in order to fulfill a given H(E) requirement.

To measure the scale of the BAO precisely, a substantial volume of space must be surveyed. We test whether light-cone effects are important and whether the scaling relations used to compensate for an incorrect reference cosmology are in this case sufficiently accurate. We investigate the degeneracies in the cosmological parameters and the benefits of using the two-dimensional anisotropic power spectrum. Finally, we estimate the uncertainty with which w can be measured by proposed surveys at redshifts of about z=3 and z=1, respectively.   In the simulated survey we find that light-cone effects are small and that the simple scaling relations used to correct for the cosmological distortion work fairly well even for large survey volumes. The analysis of the two-dimensional anisotropic power spectra enables an independent determination to be made of the apparent scale of the BAO, perpendicular and parallel to the line of sight. This is essential for two-parameter w-models, such as the redshift-dependent dark energy model w=w_0+(1-a)w_a.

We propose a novel cooperative transmission strategy, which exploits the spatial diversity and multiuser diversity to enhance the system capacity. The proposed strategy is based on a two-stage precoding scheme, where the transmitters first precode their signals using a beamforming matrix, and then the receivers combine the received signals using a combining matrix. We analyze the achievable rate of the proposed strategy and derive a closed-form expression for the capacity gain. Our numerical results show that the proposed strategy can achieve significant capacity gains, up to 3 dB, compared to the non-cooperative case.

This paper reports the performances of the charge injection capability based on the ground experiments using a radiation damaged device, and in-orbit measurements of the XIS. The ground experiments show that charges are stably injected with the dispersion of 91eV in FWHM in a specific column for the charges equivalent to the X-ray energy of 5.1keV.

Aims: We study the distribution and properties of the gas and stars surrounding the luminous (10^4 L_sun) protocluster IRAS 18511+0146. Methods: IRAS 18511+0146 and the cluster associated with it has been investigated using the sub-millimetre (JCMT-SCUBA), infrared (Spitzer-MIPSGAL, Spitzer-GLIMPSE, Palomar) and radio (VLA) continuum data. Cluster simulations have been carried out in order to understand the properties of clusters as well as to compare with the observations. Results: The central most obscured part of the protocluster coincident with the compact sub-millimetre source found with SCUBA is responsible for at least 2/3 of the total luminosity. A number of cluster members have been identified which are bright in mid infrared and show rising (near to mid infrared) spectral energy distributions suggesting that these are very young stellar sources. In the mid infrared 8.0 micron image, a number of filamentary structures and clumps are detected in the vicinity of IRAS 18511+0146. Conclusions: Based on the luminosity and cluster size as well as on the evolutionary stages of the cluster members, IRAS 18511+0146 is likely to be protocluster with the most massive object being a precursor to a Herbig type star.

When run on a single processor, the dualheap selection algorithm's performance is competitive with quickselect with median estimation, a common variant of C.A.R. Hoare's quicksort algorithm.

The width process of a splitting tree is then a binary, homogeneous Crump--Mode--Jagers (CMJ) process, and is not Markovian unless the lifetime distribution is exponential. Here, we allow the birth rate to be infinite, that is, pairs of birth times and lifespans of newborns form a Poisson point process along the lifetime of their mother, with possibly infinite intensity measure. A splitting tree is a random (so-called) chronological tree. Each element of a chronological tree is a (so-called) existence point $(v,\\tau)$ of some individual $v$ (vertex) in a discrete tree, where $\\tau$ is a nonnegative real number called chronological level (time). We introduce a total order on existence points, called linear order, and a mapping $\\varphi$ from the tree into the real line which preserves this order. The inverse of $\\varphi$ is called the exploration process, and the projection of this inverse on chronological levels the contour process. For splitting trees truncated up to level $\\tau$, we prove that thus defined contour process is a L\\'evy process reflected below $\\tau$ and killed upon hitting 0. This allows to derive properties of (i) splitting trees: conceptual proof of Le Gall--Le Jan's theorem in the finite variation case, exceptional points, coalescent point process, age distribution; (ii) CMJ processes: one-dimensional marginals, conditionings, limit theorems, asymptotic numbers of individuals with infinite vs finite descendances.

A central enigma has been the evolution of the zero energy electrons in the metallic state between the antiferromagnet and the superconductor, and recent experiments yield apparently contradictory results. The oscillation of the resistance in this metal as a function of magnetic field indicate that the zero energy electrons carry momenta which lie on elliptical `Fermi pockets', while ejection of electrons by high intensity light indicates that the zero energy electrons have momenta only along arc-like regions.

Next we demonstrate that the same Weyl types characterize warped product spacetimes with a one-dimensional Lorentzian (timelike) factor, whereas warped spacetimes with a two-dimensional Lorentzian factor are restricted to the types D or O.

A secondary receiver observes a multiple access channel of two users, the secondary and the primary transmitter, respectively. We show that, for spectrally-efficient operation, the secondary system should apply Opportunistic Interference Cancellation (OIC). With OIC, the secondary system decodes the primary signal when such an opportunity is created by the primary rate and the power received from the primary system. For such an operation, we derive the achievable data rate in the secondary system. When the primary signal is decodable, we devise a method, based on superposition coding, by which the secondary system can achieve the maximal possible rate. Finally, we investigate the power allocation in the secondary system when multiple channels are used.

{"source_id": 706.197, "title": "Energy Density-Flux Correlations in an Unusual Quantum State and in the Vacuum", "abstract": "  In this paper we consider the question of the degree to which negative and positive energy are intertwined. We examine in more detail a previously studied quantum state of the massless minimally coupled scalar field, which we call a ``Helfer state''. This is a state in which the energy density can be made arbitrarily negative over an arbitrarily large region of space, but only at one instant in time. In the Helfer state, the negative energy density is accompanied by rapidly time-varying energy fluxes. It is the latter feature which allows the quantum inequalities, bounds which restrict the magnitude and duration of negative energy, to hold for this class of states. An observer who initially passes through the negative energy region will quickly encounter fluxes of positive energy which subsequently enter the region. We examine in detail the correlation between the energy density and flux in the Helfer state in terms of their expectation values. We then study the correlation function between energy density and flux in the Minkowski vacuum state, for a massless minimally coupled scalar field in both two and four dimensions. In this latter analysis we examine correlation functions rather than expectation values. Remarkably, we see qualitatively similar behavior to that in the Helfer state. More specifically, an initial negative energy vacuum fluctuation in some region of space is correlated with a subsequent flux fluctuation of positive energy into the region. We speculate that the mechanism which ensures that the quantum inequalities hold in the Helfer state, as well as in other quantum states associated with negative energy, is, at least in some sense, already ``encoded'' in the fluctuations of the vacuum.

In the slave-boson theory, the nodal quasiparticle current renormalization factor $\\alpha$ vanishes proportionally to the zero temperature superfluid density $\\rho_S(0)$; however, we find that away from the $\\rho_S(0) \\to 0$ limit $\\alpha$ displays a much weaker doping dependence than $\\rho_S(0)$. A similar conclusion applies to the doped-carrier theory, which differentiates the nodal and antinodal regions of momentum space. Due to its momentum space anisotropy, the doped-carrier theory enhances the value of $\\alpha$ in the hole doped regime, bringing it to quantitative agreement with experiments, and reproduces the asymmetry between hole and electron doped cuprate superconductors. Finally, we use the doped-carrier theory to predict a specific experimental signature of local staggered spin correlations in doped Mott insulator superconductors which, we propose, should be observed in STM measurements of underdoped high-Tc compounds.

Here we present the complete calculation providing precise details, in particular, of the regularization procedure, which is decisive for the correct derivation of physically meaningful quantities. A basic difference when comparing with the results previously obtained by other authors is the fact that the motion force derived in our approach contains a reactive term --proportional to the mirrors' acceleration. This is of the essence in order to obtain particles with a positive energy all the time during the oscillation of the mirrors --while always satisfying the energy conservation law. A careful analysis of the interrelations among the different results previously obtained in the literature is then carried out. For simplicity, the specific case of a neutral scalar field in one dimension, with one or two partially transmitting mirrors (a fundamental proviso for the regularization issue) is considered in more detail, but our general method is shown to be generalizable, without essential problems (Sect. 2 of this paper), to fields of any kind in two and higher dimensions.

At the theoretical level, the main claim of this paper is that syntactic networks should be interpreted as the outcome of the use of the syntactic machinery. Thus, the intrinsic features of such machinery are not accessible directly from (known) network properties. Rather, what one can see are the global patterns of its use and, thus, a global view of the power and organization of the underlying grammar. Taking a look into more practical issues, the paper examines how to build a net from the projection of syntactic relations. Recall that, as opposed to adult grammars, early-child language has not a well-defined concept of structure. To overcome such difficulty, we develop a set of systematic criteria assuming constituency hierarchy and a grammar based on lexico-thematic relations. At the end, what we obtain is a well defined corpora annotation that enables us i) to perform statistics on the size of structures and ii) to build a network from syntactic relations over which we can perform the standard measures of complexity.

With an internal symmetry group $G$ having $D$ generators not only the pure Lorentz symmetry SO(1,3), but the larger accidental symmetry $SO(D,3D)$ of the SLIV constraint in itself appears to be spontaneously broken as well. As a result, while the pure Lorentz violation still generates only one genuine Goldstone vector boson, the accompanying pseudo-Goldstone vector bosons related to the $SO(D,3D)$ breaking also come into play in the final arrangement of the entire Goldstone vector field multiplet. Remarkably, they remain strictly massless, being protected by gauge invariance of the Yang-Mills theory involved. We show that, although this theory contains a plethora of Lorentz and $CPT$ violating couplings, they do not lead to physical SLIV effects which turn out to be strictly cancelled in all the lowest order processes considered.

In addition to a previous work, the thermal effects are studied separately both in the kinetic part and the interaction part of the symmetry energy. We focus also on the calculations of the mean field potential, employed extensively in heavy ion reaction research, both for nuclear and pure neutron matter. The proton fraction and the electron chemical potential, which are crucial quantities for representing the thermal evolution of supernova and neutron stars, are calculated for various values of the temperature.

We give simple expressions, explicitly dependent on the particle density, for the evolution of power in each mode as a function of red-shift. For typical starting red-shifts the effect of finite particle number is to {\\it slow down} slightly the growth of power compared to that in the fluid limit (e.g. by about ten percent at half the Nyquist frequency), and to induce also dispersion in the growth as a function of direction at a comparable level. In the limit that the initial red-shift tends to infinity, at fixed particle density, the evolution in fact diverges from that in the fluid limit (described by the Zeldovich approximation). Contrary to widely held belief, this means that a simulation started at a red-shift much higher than the red-shift of shell crossing actually gives a worse, rather than a better, result. We also study how these effects are modified when there is a small-scale regularization of the gravitational force. We show that such a smoothing may reduce the anisotropy of the discreteness effects, but it then {\\it increases} their average effect. This behaviour illustrates the fact that the discreteness effects described here are distinct from those usually considered in this context, due to two-body collisions.

The analysis is based on methods introduced by J. Polchinski concerning the perturbative renormalization with flow equations. In the first part of this work, the program of renormalization with flow equations is reviewed and then extended to effective field theories that have a finite UV cutoff. This is done for a scalar field theory by imposing additional renormalization conditions for some of the nonrenormalizable couplings. It turns out that one so obtains a statement on the predictivity of the effective theory at scales far below the UV cutoff. In particular, nonrenormalizable theories can be treated without problems in the proposed framework. In the second part, the standard covariant BRS quantization program for Euclidean Einstein gravity is applied. A momentum cutoff regularization is imposed and the resulting violation of the Slavnov-Taylor identities is discussed. Deriving Polchinski's renormalization group equation for Euclidean quantum gravity, the predictivity of effective quantum gravity at scales far below the Planck scale is investigated with flow equations. A fine-tuning procedure for restoring the violated Slavnov-Taylor identities is proposed and it is argued that in the effective quantum gravity context, the restoration will only be accomplished with finite accuracy. Finally, the no-cutoff limit of Euclidean quantum gravity is analyzed from the viewpoint of the Polchinski method. It is speculated whether a limit with nonvanishing gravitational constant might exist where the latter would ultimatively be determined by the cosmological constant and the masses of the elementary particles.

We extend a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation that reproduces a number of observations for local and high-z galaxies, without changing the original model parameters but introducing a physically-motivated modelling to describe the escape fraction of Lya photons from host galaxies (f_esc). Though a previous study using a hierarchical clustering model simply assumed a constant and universal value of f_esc, we incorporate two new effects on f_esc: extinction by interstellar dust and galaxy-scale outflow induced as a star formation feedback. It is found that the new model nicely reproduces all the observed Lya LFs of the Lya emitters (LAEs) at different redshifts in z ~ 3-6. Especially, the rather surprisingly small evolution of the observed LAE Lya LFs compared with the dark halo mass function is naturally reproduced. Our model predicts that galaxies with strong outflows and f_esc ~ 1 are dominant in the observed LFs. This is also consistent with available observations, while the simple universal f_esc model requires f_esc << 1 not to overproduce the brightest LAEs. On the other hand, we found that our model significantly overpredicts LAEs at z > 6, and absorption of Lya photons by neutral hydrogen in intergalactic medium (IGM) is a reasonable interpretation for the discrepancy. This indicates that the IGM neutral fraction x_HI rapidly evolves from x_HI << 1 at z < 6 to a value of order unity at z ~ 6-7, which is broadly consistent with other observational constraints on the reionization history.

Analyzed together with multiband polarization data from the literature, probing the Chamaeleon I, Musca, rho Opiuchus, R CrA and Taurus clouds, we show that the wavelength of maximum polarization (lambda_max) is linearly correlated with the radiation environment of the grains. Using Far-Infrared emission data, we show that the large scatter seen in previous studies of lambda_max as a function of A_V is primarily due to line of sight effects causing some A_V measurements to not be a good tracer of the extinction (radiation field strength) seen by the grains being probed. The derived slopes in lambda_max vs. A_V, for the individual clouds, are consistent with a common value, while the zero intercepts scale with the average values of the ratios of total-to-selective extinction (R_V) for the individual clouds. Within each cloud we do not find direct correlations between lambda_max and R_V. The positive slope in consistent with recent developments in theory and indicating alignment driven by the radiation field. The present data cannot conclusively differentiate between direct radiative torques and alignment driven by H_2 formation. However, the small values of lambda_max(A_V=0), seen in several clouds, suggest a role for the latter, at least at the cloud surfaces. The scatter in the lambda_max vs. A_V relation is found to be associated with the characteristics of the embedded Young Stellar Objects (YSO) in the clouds. We propose that this is partially due to locally increased plasma damping of the grain rotation caused by X-rays from the YSOs.

In fact, for non-selfadjoint operators the resolvent could be very large outside the spectrum, making the numerical computation of the complex eigenvalues very hard. This has importance, for example, in quantum mechanics, random matrix theory and fluid dynamics.   The occurence of pseudospectra for non-selfadjoint semiclassical differential operators is due to the existence of quasimodes, i.e., approximate local solutions to the eigenvalue problem. For scalar operators, the quasimodes appear since the bracket condition is not satisfied for topological reasons, see the paper by Dencker, Sjostrand and Zworski in Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 57 (2004), 384-415.   In this paper we shall investigate how these result can be generalized to square systems of semiclassical differential operators of principal type. These are the systems whose principal symbol vanishes of first order on its kernel. We show that the resolvent blows up as in the scalar case, except in a nowhere dense set of degenerate values.

It does not require long-distance freshwater transportation. If seawater is not utilized for increasing its productivity, this inexpensive new method is very environment-friendly. The author method has two working versions: (1) the first variant the warm (hot) atmospheric air is lifted by the inflatable tube in a high altitude and atmospheric steam is condenced into freswater: (2) in the second version, the warm air is pumped 20-30 meters under the sea-surface. In the first version, wind and solar heating of air are used for causing air flow. In version (2) wind and propeller are used for causing air movment.   The first method does not need energy, the second needs a small amount. Moreover, in variant (1) the freshwater has a high pressure (>30 or more atm.) and can be used for production of energy such as electricity and in that way the freshwater cost is lower. For increasing the productivity the seawater is injected into air and solar air heater may be used.

TeV observations of the distant blazar 1ES 1101-232 were thus recently used to put an upper limit on the infrared extragalactic background light density. The created pairs can upscatter background photons to high energies, which in turn may pair produce, thereby initiating a cascade. The pairs diffuse on the extragalactic magnetic field (EMF) and cascade emission has been suggested as a means for measuring its intensity. Limits on the IR background and EMF are reconsidered taking into account cascade emissions. The cascade equations are solved numerically. Assuming a power-law intrinsic spectrum, the observed 100 MeV - 100 TeV spectrum is found as a function of the intrinsic spectral index and the intensity of the EMF. Cascades emit mainly at or below 100 GeV. The observed TeV spectrum appears softer than for pure absorption when cascade emission is taken into account. The upper limit on the IR photon background is found to be robust. Inversely, the intrinsic spectra needed to fit the TeV data are uncomfortably hard when cascade emission makes a significant contribution to the observed spectrum.

Of particular importance is the relative timing of the reionization history of a region and its halo assembly history, which can affect the nature of the first stars formed in that region, the properties and radial distribution of its stellar halo, globular cluster population and its satellite galaxies. We distinguish two basic cases for the reionization of a halo - internal reionization, whereby the stars forming in situ reionize their host galaxy, and external reionization, whereby the progenitor of a galaxy is reionized by external radiation before its own stars are able to form in sufficient numbers. We use a set of large-scale radiative transfer and structure formation simulations, based on cosmologies derived from both WMAP 1-year and WMAP 3-year data, to evaluate the mean reionization redshifts and the probability of internal/external reionization for Local Group-like systems, galaxies in the field and central cD galaxies in clusters. We find that these probabilities are strongly dependent on the underlying cosmology and the efficiency of photon production, but also on the halo mass. There is a rapid transition between predominantly external and predominantly internal reionization at a mass scale of 1.0e12 Msun (corresponding roughly to L*galaxies), with haloes less massive than this being reionized preferentially from distant sources.

Furthermore, we find that the presence of a nearby group can significantly accelerate reionization by providing an additional source of ionizing photons. Our analysis suggests that the Virgo cluster may have played a crucial role in reionizing the Local Group, with the cluster's massive halo and nearby group members contributing to the rapid reionization of the surrounding region. Our findings highlight the importance of considering both halo mass and environment when studying the reionization history of the Local Group and other nearby galaxy clusters."}

ECHO is aimed at providing a shock-capturing conservative method able to work at an arbitrary level of formal accuracy (for smooth flows), where the other existing GRMHD and GRMD schemes yield an overall second order at most. Moreover, our goal is to present a general framework, based on the 3+1 Eulerian formalism, allowing for different sets of equations, different algorithms, and working in a generic space-time metric, so that ECHO may be easily coupled to any solver for Einstein's equations. Various high order reconstruction methods are implemented and a two-wave approximate Riemann solver is used. The induction equation is treated by adopting the Upwind Constrained Transport (UCT) procedures, appropriate to preserve the divergence-free condition of the magnetic field in shock-capturing methods. The limiting case of magnetodynamics (also known as force-free degenerate electrodynamics) is implemented by simply replacing the fluid velocity with the electromagnetic drift velocity and by neglecting the matter contribution to the stress tensor. ECHO is particularly accurate, efficient, versatile, and robust. It has been tested against several astrophysical applications, including a novel test on the propagation of large amplitude circularly polarized Alfven waves. In particular, we show that reconstruction based on a Monotonicity Preserving filter applied to a fixed 5-point stencil gives highly accurate results for smooth solutions, both in flat and curved metric (up to the nominal fifth order), while at the same time providing sharp profiles in tests involving discontinuities.

We compare and supplement this sample with 23 strong MgII absorbers at 0.4 < z < 1.4 observed previously with HIRES/Keck. We find that neither equivalent width nor kinematic spread (the optical depth weighted second moment of velocity) of MgII2796 evolve. However, the kinematic spread is sensitive to the highest velocity component, and therefore not as sensitive to additional weak components at intermediate velocities relative to the profile center. The fraction of absorbing pixels within the full velocity range of the system does show a trend of decreasing with decreasing redshift. Most high redshift systems (14/20) exhibit absorption over the entire system velocity range, which differs from the result for low redshift systems (18/36) at the 95% level. This leads to a smaller number of separate subsystems for high redshift systems because weak absorping components tend to connect the stronger regions of absorption. We hypothesize that low redshift MgII profiles are more likely to represent well formed galaxies, many of which have kinematics consistent with a disk/halo structure. High redshift MgII profiles are more likely to show evidence of complex protogalactic structures, with multiple accretion or outflow events. Although these results are derived from measurements of gas kinematics, they are consistent with hierarchical galaxy formation evidenced by deep galaxy surveys.

The parameter space of the simulated clouds is consistent with all of the observed HVC complexes that have distance constraints, except the Magellanic Stream which is known to have a different origin.

Real Space", "abstract": "  It is well known gravitational lensing, mainly via magnification bias, modifies the observed galaxy/quasar clustering. Such discussions have largely focused on the 2D angular correlation. Here and in a companion paper (Paper II) we explore how magnification bias distorts the 3D correlation function and power spectrum, as first considered by Matsubara. The interesting point is: the distortion is anisotropic. Magnification bias preferentially enhances the observed correlation in the line-of-sight (LOS) orientation, especially on large scales. For example at LOS separation of ~100 Mpc/h, where the intrinsic galaxy-galaxy correlation is rather weak, the observed correlation can be enhanced by lensing by a factor of a few, even at a modest redshift of z ~ 0.35. The opportunity: this lensing anisotropy is distinctive, making it possible to separately measure the galaxy-galaxy, galaxy-magnification and magnification-magnification correlations, without measuring galaxy shapes. The anisotropy is distinguishable from the well known distortion due to peculiar motions, as will be discussed in Paper II. The challenge: the magnification distortion of the galaxy correlation must be accounted for in interpreting data as precision improves. For instance, the ~100 Mpc/h baryon acoustic oscillation scale in the correlation function is shifted by up to ~3% in the LOS orientation, and up to ~0.6% in the monopole, depending on the galaxy bias, redshift and number count slope. The corresponding shifts in the inferred Hubble parameter and angular diameter distance, if ignored, could significantly bias measurements of the dark energy equation of state.

In a previous paper (Greenshields & Reese, 2007), we found these modifications gave good predictions of the viscous structure of shock waves in argon in the range Mach 1.0-12.0 (while conventional Navier-Stokes equations are known to fail above about Mach 2). However, some areas of concern with this model were a somewhat arbitrary choice of modelling coefficient, and potentially unphysical and unstable solutions. In this paper, we therefore present slightly different modifications to include molecule mass diffusion fully in the Navier-Stokes equations. These modifications are shown to be stable and produce physical solutions to the shock problem of a quality broadly similar to those from the family of extended hydrodynamic models that includes the Burnett equations. The modifications primarily add a diffusion term to the mass conservation equation, so are at least as simple to solve as the Navier-Stokes equations; there are none of the numerical implementation problems of conventional extended hydrodynamics models, particularly in respect of boundary conditions.

They argue that by the principle of action equals reaction, one would expect the angular momentum of test bodies to couple to a background torsion field, and therefore the precession of the GPB gyroscopes should be affected in these theories by the torsion generated by the Earth. We show that in fact the principle of action equals reaction does not apply to these theories. We examine in detail a generalization of the Hayashi-Shirafuji theory suggested by Mao et al. called Einstein-Hayashi-Shirafuji theory. There are a variety of different versions of this theory, depending on the precise form of the coupling to matter chosen for the torsion. We show that for any coupling to matter that is compatible with the spin transport equation postulated by Mao et al., the theory has either ghosts or an ill-posed initial value formulation. These theoretical problems can be avoided by specializing the parameters of the theory and in addition choosing the standard minimal coupling to matter of the torsion tensor. This yields a consistent theory, but one in which the action equals reaction principle is violated, and in which the angular momentum of the gyroscopes does not couple to the Earth's torsion field. Thus, the Einstein-Hayashi-Shirafuji theory does not predict a detectable torsion signal for Gravity Probe B. There may be other torsion theories which do.

We employ a combination of theoretical and numerical methods to analyze the gravitational redshift and frame-dragging effects predicted by these theories. Our results show that GPB's accuracy is insufficient to provide meaningful constraints on torsion gravity theories, as the predicted effects are either too small or too sensitive to the specific theory's parameters. We also explore the possibility of using GPB's data to test torsion gravity theories by fitting the experiment's results to the theories' predictions. Our analysis reveals that the data are consistent with the predictions of general relativity, but the torsion gravity theories' fits are not significantly worse than the GR fit. Consequently, we conclude that GPB's data do not provide useful constraints on torsion gravity theories, and alternative experiments or observations are needed to test these theories."}

The archival X-ray observations show a hard (Gamma ~ 1.8), low luminosity (L_X ~ 4 x 10^31 ergs/s) point source at the center of the nebula. Follow-up LGS-AO near-infrared imaging of the Chandra error circle reveals a relatively bright (K' ~ 14 magnitude) counterpart. Both its color and brightness are consistent with a heavily obscured B-star or possibly a late-G/early-K giant. The most plausible explanation is that this newly discovered X-ray source is a non-accreting B-star/pulsar binary powering the radio and optical nebula. If so, the luminous Be-star discussed in the literature seemingly embedded in the nebula is not the dominant force responsible for shaping G70.7+1.2. Thus, we suggest that G70.7+1.2 is the result of two unrelated objects (a B-star X-ray binary and a Be star) interacting with a dense molecular cloud. With this explanation we believe we have solved the mystery of the origin of G70.7+1.2.

We address the long-standing question of the remnant's origin, which has been debated due to its unusual morphology and lack of clear association with a progenitor star. Our NIR observations reveal a complex, filamentary structure, which we interpret as evidence of a complex shock interaction. In contrast, our X-ray data show a more compact, centrally peaked emission, likely indicating a younger, more energetic phase of the remnant's evolution. By combining these observations, we infer a scenario in which G70.7+1.2 is the result of a Type Ia supernova explosion, with the NIR emission tracing the interaction between the remnant and surrounding material. Our results provide new insights into the remnant's evolution and support the Type Ia supernova hypothesis, resolving the long-standing debate surrounding its origin."}

The Impact of Surface Brightness", "abstract": "  Using a large sample of spiral galaxies for which 21 cm single-dish and/or long-slit optical spectra are available, we make a detailed comparison between various estimates of rotational widths. Different optical width estimators are considered and their limitations discussed, with emphasis on biases associated with rotation curve properties (shape and extent) and disk central surface brightness. The best match with HI rotational velocities is obtained with Polyex widths, which are measured at the optical radius (encompassing a fixed fraction of the total light of the galaxy) from a model fit to the rotation curve. In contrast with Polyex widths, optical rotational velocities measured at 2.15 disk scale lengths r_d deviate from HI widths by an amount that correlates with the central surface brightness of the disk. This bias occurs because the rotation curves of galaxies are in general still rising at 2.15 r_d, and the fraction of total mass contained within this radius decreases with increasing disk surface brightness. Statistical corrections, parameterized by the radial extent of the observed rotation curve, are provided to reduce Polyex and HI width measurements into a homogeneous system. This yields a single robust estimate of rotational velocity to be used for applications of disk scaling relations.

By analyzing a sample of 34 galaxies, we find that surface brightness has a significant effect on the measured rotational widths, with brighter galaxies exhibiting broader rotation curves. We attribute this trend to the increased sensitivity of our measurements to the galaxy's inner regions, where the surface brightness is highest. Our results demonstrate that neglecting the surface brightness effect can lead to biased estimates of rotational widths, which in turn affect the calibration of the Tully-Fisher relation. We discuss the implications of our findings for the understanding of galaxy evolution and the determination of galaxy distances, highlighting the importance of considering the surface brightness effect in future studies. Our analysis also reveals that the inclusion of surface brightness as a parameter in the Tully-Fisher relation can improve its accuracy and precision, providing a more robust tool for understanding the properties of galaxies."}
{"source_id": 705.1922, "title": "Crystallization in large wireless networks", "abstract": "  We analyze fading interference relay networks where M single-antenna source-destination terminal pairs communicate concurrently and in the same frequency band through a set of K single-antenna relays using half-duplex two-hop relaying. Assuming that the relays have channel state information (CSI), it is shown that in the large-M limit, provided K grows fast enough as a function of M, the network \"decouples\" in the sense that the individual source-destination terminal pair capacities are strictly positive. The corresponding required rate of growth of K as a function of M is found to be sufficient to also make the individual source-destination fading links converge to nonfading links. We say that the network \"crystallizes\" as it breaks up into a set of effectively isolated \"wires in the air\". A large-deviations analysis is performed to characterize the \"crystallization\" rate, i.e., the rate (as a function of M,K) at which the decoupled links converge to nonfading links. In the course of this analysis, we develop a new technique for characterizing the large-deviations behavior of certain sums of dependent random variables. For the case of no CSI at the relay level, assuming amplify-and-forward relaying, we compute the per source-destination terminal pair capacity for M,K converging to infinity, with K/M staying fixed, using tools from large random matrix theory.

Our methodology combines graph theory, statistical physics, and simulation techniques to model the dynamics of node interactions and the emergence of crystalline structures. We find that the crystallization process is driven by a competition between short-range attractive interactions and long-range repulsive forces, which lead to the formation of ordered clusters. Our results demonstrate that the crystallization phenomenon is a universal feature of large wireless networks, and we provide a framework for understanding and predicting the behavior of such systems. We also show that the crystallization process can be influenced by various factors, such as node mobility, transmission power, and network topology, which provides valuable insights for optimizing wireless network performance."}
