The method is designed to eliminate the problems inherent in the rate-equation formalism to surface chemistry. Here we report the first use of this method in a chemical model of cold interstellar cloud cores that includes both gas-phase and surface chemistry. The surface chemical network consists of a small number of diffusive reactions that can produce molecular oxygen, water, carbon dioxide, formaldehyde, methanol and assorted radicals. METHOD: The simulation is started by running a gas-phase model including accretion onto grains but no surface chemistry or evaporation. The starting surface consists of either flat or rough olivine. We introduce the surface chemistry of the three species H, O and CO in an iterative manner using our stochastic technique. Under the conditions of the simulation, only atomic hydrogen can evaporate to a significant extent. Although it has little effect on other gas-phase species, the evaporation of atomic hydrogen changes its gas-phase abundance, which in turn changes the flux of atomic hydrogen onto grains. The effect on the surface chemistry is treated until convergence occurs. We neglect all non-thermal desorptive processes. RESULTS: We determine the mantle abundances of assorted molecules as a function of time through 2x10^5 yr. Our method also allows determination of the abundance of each molecule in specific monolayers. The mantle results can be compared with observations of water, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and methanol ices in the sources W33A and Elias 16. Other than a slight underproduction of mantle CO, our results are in very good agreement with observations.

An examination of the distribution of semi-major axes shows that there is a clear excess of planets with orbital periods around 3 or 4 days, corresponding to a~0.03$ AU, with a sharp cutoff at shorter periods (see Figure 1). It is believed that Jupiter mass planets form at large distances from their parent stars; some fraction then migrate in to produce the short period objects. We argue that a significant fraction of the `hot Jupiters' (a<0.1 AU) may arise in binary star systems in which the orbit of the binary is highly inclined to the orbit of the planet. Mutual torques between the two orbits drive down the minimum separation or periapse r_p between the planet and its host star (the Kozai mechanism). This periapse collapse is halted when tidal friction on the planet circularizes the orbit faster than Kozai torque can excite it. The same friction then circularizes the planet orbit, producing hot Jupiters with the peak of the semimajor axis distribution lying around 3 days. For the observed distributions of binary separation, eccentricity and mass ratio, roughly 2.5% of planets with initial semimajor axis a_p ~ 5au will migrate to within 0.1au of their parent star.

In most regions of these disks, gas attains sub-Keplerian speeds as a consequence of a negative pressure gradient. Hydrodynamic drag leads to orbital decay and depletion of the solid material in the disk, with characteristic timescales as short as only a few hundred years for meter-sized objects at 1 AU. In this paper, we suggest a particle retention mechanism which promotes the accumulation of grains and the formation of planetesimals near the water sublimation front or ``snow line.'' This model is based on the assumption that, in the regions most interesting for planet formation, the viscous evolution of the disk is due to turbulence driven by the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) in the surface layers of the disk. The depth to which MRI effectively generates turbulence is a strong function of the grain size and abundance. A sharp increase in the grain-to-gas density ratio across the snow line reduces the column depth of the active layer. As the disk evolves towards a quasi-steady-state, this change in the active layer creates a local maximum in radial distribution of the gas surface density and pressure, causing the gas to rotate at super-Keplerian speed and halting the inward migration of grains. This senario presents a robust process for grain retention which may aid in the formation of proto-gas-giant cores preferentially near the snow line.

Here we calculate the photon scattering rate profile for a single ultraviolet source. After taking into account previously neglected natural broadening of the resonance line, we find that photons approach the resonance frequency and experience most scatterings at a significantly smaller distance from the source than naively expected r=(dnu/nu_0)(c/H), where dnu=nu-nu_0 is the initial frequency offset, and the discrepancy increases as the initial frequency offset decreases. As a consequence, the scattering rate P(r) drops much faster with increasing distance than the previously assumed 1/r^2 profile. Near the source (r<1Mpc comoving), the scattering rate of photons that redshift into the Ly_alpha resonance converges to P(r) \\propto r^{-7/3}. The scattering rate of Ly_alpha photons produced by splitting of photons that redshift into a higher resonance (Ly_gamma, Ly_delta, etc.) is only weakly affected by the radiative transfer, while the sum of scattering rates of Ly_alpha photons produced from all higher resonances also converges to P(r) \\propto r^{-7/3} near the source. At 15<z<35, on scales of ~0.01-20Mpc/h (comoving), the total scattering rate of Ly_alpha photons from all Lyman resonances is found to be higher by a factor of ~1+0.3[(1+z)/20]^{2/3} than obtained without full radiative transfer.

We wish here to carry out a quantitative assessment of these competing models for this extraordinary source. We apply a 3D SPH code for dynamical simulations of both the pulsar-wind-interaction and accretion-jet models. The former yields a description of the shape of the wind-wind interaction surface. The latter provides an estimation of the accretion rate. The results allow critical evaluation of how the two distinct models confront the data in various wavebands under a range of conditions. When one accounts for the 3D dynamical wind interaction under realistic constraints for the relative strength of the B-star and pulsar winds, the resulting form of the interaction front does not match the putative \"cometary tail\" claimed from radio observations.

We examine in more detail a previously studied quantum state of the massless minimally coupled scalar field, which we call a ``Helfer state''. This is a state in which the energy density can be made arbitrarily negative over an arbitrarily large region of space, but only at one instant in time. In the Helfer state, the negative energy density is accompanied by rapidly time-varying energy fluxes. It is the latter feature which allows the quantum inequalities, bounds which restrict the magnitude and duration of negative energy, to hold for this class of states. An observer who initially passes through the negative energy region will quickly encounter fluxes of positive energy which subsequently enter the region. We examine in detail the correlation between the energy density and flux in the Helfer state in terms of their expectation values. We then study the correlation function between energy density and flux in the Minkowski vacuum state, for a massless minimally coupled scalar field in both two and four dimensions. In this latter analysis we examine correlation functions rather than expectation values. Remarkably, we see qualitatively similar behavior to that in the Helfer state. More specifically, an initial negative energy vacuum fluctuation in some region of space is correlated with a subsequent flux fluctuation of positive energy into the region. We speculate that the mechanism which ensures that the quantum inequalities hold in the Helfer state, as well as in other quantum states associated with negative energy, is, at least in some sense, already ``encoded'' in the fluctuations of the vacuum.

Alon, Benjamini, Lubetzky and Sodin studied non-backtracking random walks on regular graphs, and showed that their mixing rate may be up to twice as fast as that of the simple random walk. As an application, they showed that the maximal number of visits to a vertex, made by a non-backtracking random walk of length $n$ on a high-girth $n$-vertex regular expander, is typically $(1+o(1))\\frac{\\log n}{\\log\\log n}$, as in the case of the balls and bins experiment. They further asked whether one can establish the precise distribution of the visits such a walk makes.   In this work, we answer the above question by combining a generalized form of Brun's sieve with some extensions of the ideas in Alon et al. Let $N_t$ denote the number of vertices visited precisely $t$ times by a non-backtracking random walk of length $n$ on a regular $n$-vertex expander of fixed degree and girth $g$. We prove that if $g=\\omega(1)$, then for any fixed $t$, $N_t/n$ is typically $\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{e}t!}+o(1)$. Furthermore, if $g=\\Omega(\\log\\log n)$, then $N_t/n$ is typically $\\frac{1+o(1)}{\\mathrm{e}t!}$ uniformly on all $t \\leq (1-o(1))\\frac{\\log n}{\\log\\log n}$ and 0 for all $t \\geq (1+o(1))\\frac{\\log n}{\\log\\log n}$.

In the ``supercritical'' regime, eminent spatiotemporal correlations, {\\it e.g.}, remarkable growth of seismic activity preceding the mainshock, arise in earthquake occurrence, whereas such spatiotemporal correlations are significantly suppressed in the ``subcritical'' regime. Seismic activity is generically suppressed just before the mainshock in a close vicinity of the epicenter of the upcoming event while it remains to be active in the surroundings (the Mogi doughnut). It is also observed that, before and after the mainshock, the apparent $B$-value of the magnitude distribution decreases or increases in the ``supercritical'' or ``subcritical'' regimes, respectively.

It is shown that, for both receivers, the problem at hand of utility maximization can be regarded as a non-cooperative game, and it is proved that a unique Nash equilibrium point exists. Simulation results show that significant performance gains can be obtained through both non-linear processing and spreading code optimization; in particular, for systems with a number of users not larger than the processing gain, remarkable gains come from spreading code optimization, while, for overloaded systems, the largest gainscome from the use of non-linear processing.

Our approach combines high-resolution, multi-scale simulations with a deep dive into thermodynamic and dynamical properties.

In this paper, while we will briefly describe the first and the second subjects, we shall focus on the third subject, the secure classical communication via wire. This way of secure telecommunication utilizes the properties of Johnson(-like) noise and those of a simple Kirchhoff's loop. The communicator is unconditionally secure at the conceptual (circuit theoretical) level and this property is (so far) unique in communication systems based on classical physics. The communicator is superior to quantum alternatives in all known aspects, except the need of using a wire. In the idealized system, the eavesdropper can extract zero bit of information without getting uncovered. The scheme is naturally protected against the man-in-the-middle attack. The communication can take place also via currently used power lines or phone (wire) lines and it is not only a point-to-point communication like quantum channels but network-ready. Tests have been carried out on a model-line with ranges beyond the ranges of any known direct quantum communication channel and they indicate unrivalled signal fidelity and security performance.

The assembly of such multicellular organisms requires signalling and response between cells: over millions of years these signalling processes have become extremely sophisticated and refined by evolution, such that study of modern organisms may not be able to shed much light on the original ancient processes . Here we are interested in determining how simple a signalling method can be, while still achieving self-assembly. In 2D a coupled cellular automaton/differential equation approach models organisms and chemotaxic chemicals, producing spiralling aggregation. In 3D Lennard-Jones-like particles are used to represent single cells, and their evolution in response to signalling is followed by molecular dynamics. It is found that if a single cell is able to emit a signal which induces others to move towards it, then a colony of single-cell organisms can assemble into shapes as complex as a tower, a ball atop a stalk, or a fast-moving slug. The similarity with the behaviour of modern Dictyostelium slime molds signalling with cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is striking.

Specifically, we aim to resolve the tension between the slow-roll approximation, which underlies most existing models, and the observational constraints on the perturbations of the primordial power spectrum. Our approach involves a novel combination of topological considerations and higher-dimensional geometric insights, which enable us to construct an explicit effective potential for the inflaton field.

We consider the potential for D3-brane motion in a warped conifold background that includes fluxes and holomorphically-embedded D7-branes involved in moduli stabilization. Although the D7-branes significantly modify the inflaton potential, they do not correct the quadratic term in the potential, and hence do not cause a uniform change in the slow-roll parameter eta. Nevertheless, we present a simple example based on the Kuperstein embedding of D7-branes, z_1=constant, in which the potential can be fine-tuned to be sufficiently flat for inflation. To derive this result, it is essential to incorporate the fact that the compactification volume changes slightly as the D3-brane moves. We stress that the compactification geometry dictates certain relationships among the parameters in the inflaton Lagrangian, and these microscopic constraints impose severe restrictions on the space of possible models. We note that the shape of the final inflaton potential differs from projections given in earlier studies: in configurations where inflation occurs, it does so near an inflection point. Finally, we comment on the difficulty of making precise cosmological predictions in this scenario. This is the companion paper to arXiv:0705.3837.
