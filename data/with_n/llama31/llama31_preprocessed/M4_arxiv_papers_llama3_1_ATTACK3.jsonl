For cooling, the components 2 and 3 are coupled by an electromagnetic field. Since the quasiparticle distributions in the paired and in the normal states are different, the coupling leads to cooling of the normal state even when initially T_paired≥ T_normal (notation T_S≥ T_N). The cooling efficiency is given by the pairing energy and by the linewidth of the coupling field. No superfluidity is required: any type of pairing, or other phenomenon that produces a suitable spectral density, is sufficient. In principle, the paired state could be cooled as well but this requires T_N<T_S. The method has a conceptual analogy to cooling based on superconductor – normal metal (SN) tunneling junctions. Main differences arise from the exact momentum conservation in the case of the field-matter coupling vs. non-conservation of momentum in the solid state tunneling process. Moreover, the role of processes that relax the energy conservation requirement in the tunneling, e.g. thermal fluctuations of an external reservoir, is now played by the linewidth of the field.

We examine the spectra of 137 quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, to search for such voids, and find no clear evidence of their existence. The size distribution of voids in the range 5-70 Angstrom (corresponding to physical sizes of approximately 3-35 comoving Mpc/h) is consistent with the standard model for the Lyman alpha forest without additional hot bubbles. We adapt a physical model for HII bubble growth during cosmological reionization (Furlanetto, Zaldarriaga and Hernquist 2004), to describe the expected size-distribution of hot super-bubbles at redshift around z = 3. This model incorporates the conjoining of bubbles around individual neighboring galaxies. Using the non-detection of voids, we find that models in which the volume filling factor of hot bubbles exceeds approximately 20 percent at z=3 can be ruled out, primarily because they overproduce the number of large (40-50 Angstrom) voids.

We find that boxy galaxies originate from mergers with a progenitor mass ratio n < 2 and with a combined cold gas mass fraction F_ cold < 0.1. Our model accurately reproduces the observed fraction of boxy systems as a function of luminosity and halo mass, for both central galaxies and satellites. After correcting for the stellar mass dependence, the properties of the last major merger of early-type galaxies are independent of their halo mass. This provides theoretical support for the conjecture of Pasquali et al (2007) that the stellar mass of an early-type galaxy is the main parameter that governs its isophotal shape. We argue that the observed dichotomy of early-type galaxies has a natural explanation within hierarchical structure formation, and does not require AGN feedback. Rather, we argue that it owes to the fact that more massive systems (i) have more massive progenitors, (ii) assemble later, and (iii) have a larger fraction of early-type progenitors. Each of these three trends causes the cold gas mass fraction of the progenitors of more massive early-types to be lower, so that their last major merger was dryer. Finally, our model predicts that (i) less than 10 percent of all early-type galaxies form in major mergers that involve two early-type progenitors, (ii) more than 95 percent of all boxy early-type galaxies with M_* < 2 × 10^10 h^-1 are satellite galaxies, and (iii) about 70 percent of all low mass early-types do not form a supermassive black hole binary at their last major merger.

Both NGC 5044 and 4636 have extended 70 microns emission from cold dust exceeding that expected from stellar mass loss. The sputtering lifetime of this extended dust in the1keV interstellar gas,10^7 yrs, establishes the time when the dust first entered the hot gas. Evidently the extended dust originated in dusty disks or clouds, commonly observed in elliptical galaxy cores, that were disrupted, heated and buoyantly transported outward. The surviving central dust in NGC 5044 and 4636 has been disrupted into many small filaments. It is remarkable that the asymmetrically extended 8 micron emission in NGC 5044 is spatially coincident with Halpha+[NII] emission from warm gas. A calculation shows that dust-assisted cooling in buoyant hot gas moving out from the galactic core can cool within a few kpc in about10^7 yrs, explaining the optical line emission observed. The X-ray images of both galaxies are disturbed. All timescales for transient activity - restoration of equilibrium and buoyant transport in the hot gas, dynamics of surviving dust fragments, and dust sputtering - are consistent with a central release of feedback energy in both galaxies about 10^7 yrs ago.

The well-known “spiral arms” are clearly observed and they trail the rotating disk material. Weaker arms never before reported are also seen. The inter-arm space becomes brighter, but the structures become more neutral in color at longer wavelengths, which is not consistent with models that assume that they are due to the effects of a warped disk.

To explain these colors, we explore the role of asymmetric scattering, reddening, and large minimum sizes on ISM-like grains. We conclude each of these hypotheses by itself cannot explain the colors. The disk colors are similar to those derived for Kuiper Belt objects, suggesting that the same processes responsible for their colors may be at work here. We argue that we are observing only the geometrically thick, optically thin envelope of the disk, while the optically thick disk responsible for the far-IR emission is undetected.

The fact that the oscillators have a low number density (dilute medium) and have a narrow-band resonance allows us to simplify the integrand. In this case, the integral can be evaluated exactly, although it is not possible using this method to separate out the transient part of the propagated field known as optical precursors.

We obtain analytic expressions for the precursor fields and the domain over which the asymptotic method is valid. When combined to obtain the total transient field, we find that the agreement between the solutions obtained by the asymptotic and the exact methods is excellent.

We study in detail the spherically symmetric regular T-models on the basis of a general exact solution for a mixture of the vacuum fluid and dustlike matter and apply it to give numerical estimates for a particular model which illustrates the ability of cosmological T-models to satisfy the observational constraints.

Many authors have therefore considered gene duplication as a driving force in shaping the topology of molecular networks. In particular it has been noted that growth via duplication would act as an implicit way of preferential attachment, and thereby provide the observed broad degree distributions of molecular networks.Results: We extend current models of gene duplication and rewiring by including directions and the fact that molecular networks are not a result of unidirectional growth. We introduce upstream sites and downstream shapes to quantify potential links during duplication and rewiring. We find that this in itself generates the observed scaling of transcription factors for genome sites in procaryotes. The dynamical model can generate a scale-free degree distribution, p(k)prop; 1/k^gamma;, with exponentgamma;=1 in the non-growing case, and withgamma;>1 when the network is growing.Conclusions: We find that duplication of genes followed by substantial recombination of upstream regions could generate main features of genetic regulatory networks. Our steady state degree distribution is however to broad to be consistent with data, thereby suggesting that selective pruning acts as a main additional constraint on duplicated genes. Our analysis shows that gene duplication can only be a main cause for the observed broad degree distributions, if there is also substantial recombinations between upstream regions of genes.

As a result of this coupling, neutrinos in the early universe instead of streaming freely could form a self-coupled fluid, with potentially observable signatures in the Cosmic Microwave Background and the large scale structure of the universe. We re-examine the constraints on this scenario from the presently available cosmological data and investigate the sensitivity expected from the Planck satellite. In the first case, we find that the sensitivity strongly depends on which piece of data is used. The SDSS Main sample data, combined with WMAP and other data, disfavors the scenario of three coupled neutrinos at about the 3.5σ confidence level, but also favors a high number of freely streaming neutrinos, with the best fit at 5.2. If the matter power spectrum is instead taken from the SDSS Large Red Galaxy sample, best fit point has 2.5 freely streaming neutrinos, but the scenario with three coupled neutrinos becomes allowed at 2σ. In contrast, Planck alone will exclude even a single self-coupled neutrino at the 4.2σ confidence level, and will determine the total radiation at CMB epoch to Δ N_ν^eff = ^+0.5_-0.3 (1σ errors). We investigate the robustness of this result with respect to the details of Planck's detector. This sensitivity to neutrino free-streaming implies that Planck will be capable of probing a large region of the Mass-Varying Neutrino parameter space.

Significant structural and evolutionary differences occur between simulations with and without heat conduction. Dense clouds in pure dynamical models experience dynamical destruction by Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability. In static models heat conduction leads to evaporation of such clouds. Heat conduction acting on clouds in a gas stream smooths out steep temperature and density gradients at the edge of the cloud because the conduction timescale is shorter than the cooling timescale. This diminishes the velocity gradient between the streaming plasma and the cloud, so that the timescale for the onset of KH instabilities increases, and the surface of the cloud becomes less susceptible to KH instabilities. The stabilisation effect of heat conduction against KH instability is more pronounced for smaller and less massive clouds. As in the static case more realistic cloud conditions allow heat conduction to transfer hot material onto the cloud's surface and to mix the accreted gas deeper into the cloud.

The best known example of such an addition theorem is the Laplace expansion of the Coulomb potential which possesses a characteristic two-range form. Guseinov [Chem. Phys. 309, 209 - 213 (2005)] derived one-range addition theorems for the Coulomb potential via the limit β→ 0 in previously derived one-range addition theorems for the Yukawa potential exp(-β | r-r'| ) /| r-r'|. At first sight, this looks like a remarkable achievement, but from a mathematical point of view, Guseinov's work is at best questionable and in some cases fundamentally flawed. One-range addition theorems are expansions in terms of functions that are complete and orthonormal in a given Hilbert space, but Guseinov replaced the complete and orthonormal functions by nonorthogonal Slater-type functions and rearranged the resulting expansions. This is a dangerous operation whose validity must be checked. It is shown that the one-center limit r' = 0 of Guseinov's rearranged Yukawa addition theorems as well as of several other addition theorems does not exist. Moreover, the Coulomb potential does not belong to any of the Hilbert spaces implicitly used by Guseinov. Accordingly, one-range addition theorems for the Coulomb potential diverge in the mean. Instead, these one-range addition theorems have to interpreted as expansions of generalized functions in the sense of Schwartz that converge weakly in suitable functionals.

The method is formulated and tested on the two-dimensional interior Poisson and exterior Laplace problems, whose solutions and their normal derivatives are required to be continuous across the interface. A complete basis of homogeneous solutions for the interior and exterior regions, corresponding to all possible Dirichlet boundary values at the interface, are calculated in a preprocessing step. This basis is used to construct the influence matrix which serves to transform the coupled boundary conditions into conditions on the interior problem. Chebyshev approximations are used to represent both the interior solutions and the boundary values. A standard Chebyshev spectral method is used to calculate the interior solutions. The exterior harmonic solutions are calculated as the convolution of the free-space Green's function with a surface density; this surface density is itself the solution to an integral equation which has an analytic solution when the boundary values are given as a Chebyshev expansion. Properties of Chebyshev approximations insure that the basis of exterior harmonic functions represents the external near-boundary solutions uniformly. The method is tested by calculating the electrostatic potential resulting from charge distributions in a rectangle. The resulting influence matrix is well-conditioned and solutions converge exponentially as the resolution is increased.

We're taking a multi-faceted approach, combining theoretical modeling with numerical simulations and observational data analysis, to tease out the key drivers behind galaxy formation and the interplay between galaxies and their surroundings. It's a complex puzzle, but we're confident that the pieces will eventually fall into place. After all, the truth is out there – we just need to keep digging. We're making slow but steady progress, and it's an exciting time to be a part of this journey. The universe is full of mysteries, but with persistence and determination, we'll eventually uncover the secrets that lie within. It's a big ask, but we're up for the challenge. Bring it on!"}

Entanglement is at the heart of quantum physics, both for its conceptual foundations and for applications in information processing and quantum communication. Remarkably, entanglement can be 'swapped': if one prepares two independent entangled pairs A1-A2 and B1-B2, a joint measurement on A1 and B1 (called a 'Bell-State Measurement', BSM) has the effect of projecting A2 and B2 onto an entangled state, although these two particles have never interacted or shared any common past[1,2]. Experiments using twin photons produced by spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) have already demonstrated entanglement swapping[3-6], but here we present its first realization using continuous wave (CW) sources, as originally proposed[2]. The challenge was to achieve sufficiently sharp synchronization of the photons in the BSM. Using narrow-band filters, the coherence time of the photons that undergo the BSM is significantly increased, exceeding the temporal resolution of the detectors. Hence pulsed sources can be replaced by CW sources, which do not require any synchronization[6,7], allowing for the first time the use of completely autonomous sources. Our experiment exploits recent progress in the time precision of photon detectors, in the efficiency of photon pair production by SPDC with waveguides in nonlinear crystals[8], and in the stability of narrow-band filters. This approach is independent of the form of entanglement; we employed time-bin entangled photons[9] at telecom wavelengths.

Furthermore, on-off behavior linearly impacts only timing aspect but not the overall infection. Using realistic mobile network measurements, we find that encounters are non-uniform, the trends are consistent with the model but the magnitudes are drastically different.

In a previous paper we showed that RPT successfully predicts the damping of acoustic oscillations; here we extend our calculation to the enhancement of power due to mode-coupling. We show that mode-coupling generates additional oscillations that are out of phase with those in the linear spectrum, leading to shifts in the scales of oscillation nodes defined with respect to a smooth spectrum. When Fourier transformed, these out of phase oscillations induce percent-level shifts in the acoustic peak of the two-point correlation function. We present predictions for these shifts as a function of redshift; these should be considered as a robust lower limit to the more realistic case that includes in addition redshift distortions and galaxy bias. We show that these nonlinear effects occur at very large scales, leading to a breakdown of linear theory at scales much larger than commonly thought. We discuss why virialized halo profiles are not responsible for these effects, which can be understood from basic physics of gravitational instability. Our results are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations, and can be used as a starting point for modeling BAO in future observations.

A compressive wave is set up in a constant sub-Jeans density distribution of radius r = 1 pc. As the wave travels through the simulation grid, a shock-bounded spherical shell is formed. The inner shock of this shell reaches and bounces off the center, leaving behind a central core with an initially almost uniform density distribution, surrounded by an envelope consisting of the material in the shock-bounded shell, with a power-law density profile that at late times approaches a logarithmic slope of -2 even in non-collapsing cases. The resulting density structure resembles a quiescent core of radius < 0.1 pc, with a Bonnor-Ebert-like (BE-like) profile, although it has significant dynamical differences: it is initially non-self-gravitating and confined by the ram pressure of the infalling material, and consequently, growing continuously in mass and size. With the appropriate parameters, the core mass eventually reaches an effective Jeans mass, at which time the core begins to collapse. Thus, there is necessarily a time delay between the appearance of the core and the onset of its collapse, but this is not due to the dissipation of its internal turbulence as it is often believed. These results suggest that pre-stellar cores may approximate Bonnor-Ebert structures which are however of variable mass and may or may not experience gravitational collapse, in qualitative agreement with the large observed frequency of cores with BE-like profiles.

We detected 72 sources at 18um in an area of 50.2 arcmin^2 in the AKARI/IRC monitor field towards the North Ecliptic Pole (NEP). From this sample, 25 galaxies with probable redshifts z>0.5 are selected with a single colour cut (N2-N3>0.1) for a detailed SED analysis with ground-based BVRi'z'JK data. Using an SED radiative transfer model of starbursts covering the wavelength range UV – submm, we derive photometric redshifts from the optical-MIR SEDs of 18um-selected galaxies. From the best-fit SED models, we show that the IRC all-band photometry is capable of tracing the steep rise in flux at the blue side of the PAH 6.2um emission feature. This indicates that the IRC all-band photometry is useful to constrain the redshift of infrared galaxies, specifically for dusty galaxies with a less prominent 4000A break. Also, we find that the flux dip between the PAH 7.7 and 11.2um emission feature is recognizable in the observed SEDs of galaxies at z 1. By using such a colour anomaly due to the PAH and silicate absorption features, unique samples of ULIRGs at z 1, `silicate-break' galaxies, can be constructed from large cosmological surveys of AKARI towards the NEP, i.e. the NEP-Deep and NEP-Wide survey. This pilot study suggests the possibility of detecting many interesting galaxy properties in the NEP-Deep and Wide surveys, such as a systematic difference in SEDs between high- and low-z ULIRGs, and a large variation of the PAH inter-band strength ratio in galaxies at high redshifts.

The analogy enables one to introduce all the powerful tools of relativistic QED (albeit in a greatly simplified form). The Feynman diagrams and the propagators turn out to be very useful. In particular, the QED concept of the vacuum polarization finds its close counterpart in the photon scattering off a two level-system leading via the linear response theory to the general formulas for the atomic polarizability and the dynamic single spin susceptibility. To illustrate the usefulness of these methods, we calculate the polarizability and susceptibility up to the fourth order of perturbation theory.

The detrending of the light curves are based on Fourier filtering or a discrete wavelet transformation. TRUFAS requires the presence of at least 3 transit events in the data. Results: The proposed algorithm is shown to identify reliably and quickly the transits that had been included in a standard set of 999 light curves that simulate CoRoT data. Variations in the pre-processing of the light curves and in the selection of the scale of the wavelet transform have only little effect on TRUFAS' results.

Micromechanical ingredients involve elasticity, friction, a short range attraction and, possibly, rolling resistance (RR) in contacts. The microstructure of the cohesive packing varies according to the assembling procedure, from rather densely packed if isolated particles are directly compressed to much looser if the formation of large aggregates is allowed prior to compression. A crucial parameter is the ratio P*= Pa/F0 of applied pressure P, acting on grains of diameter a, to maximum tensile contact force F0. At low P* the final structure depends on the level of velocity fluctuations at the early stages of cluster aggregation. With RR the coordination number approaches 2 in the limit of low initial velocities or large rolling friction. The force network generally comprises small hyperstatic clusters with forces of the order of F0, joined by nearly unstressed, barely rigid arms. As P* grows, it quickly rearranges into force chain-like patterns. Density correlations witness a fractal structure, with dimension Df, up to some density-dependent blob size. WIth RR Df coincides with the ballistic aggregation result, despite a possibly different connectivity. Possible effects of some parameters on material strength are evoked.

For this constraint to be as tight as possible, it is necessary to maximize the correlation between the two dipoles. This can be achieved by optimizing the survey window through which the flux dipole is measured. Here we explicitly construct such a window for the 2MASS survey. The optimization in essence reduces to excluding from the calculation of the flux dipole galaxies brighter than some limiting magnitude K_min of the near-infrared K_s band. This exclusion mitigates nonlinear effects and shot noise from small scales, which decorrelate the 2MASS dipole from the CMB dipole. Under the assumption of negligible shot noise we find that the optimal value of K_min is about five. Inclusion of shot noise shifts the optimal K_min to larger values. We present an analytical formula for shot noise for the 2MASS flux dipole, to be used in follow-up work with 2MASS data.The misalignment angle between the two dipoles is a sensitive measure of their correlation: the higher the correlation, the smaller the expectation value of the angle. A minimum of the misalignment is thus a sign of the optimal gravity window.

The BAL phenomenon is thought to arise from absorption of light by outflows in the interstellar medium or surrounding material, potentially affecting AGN SEDs. We analyze radio and X-ray data for our sample of quasars, aiming to figure out any correlations between the two energy regimes that could be indicative of the presence of such outflows. Our results show a significant anti-correlation between the radio and X-ray luminosities of BAL quasars, which we interpret as evidence for Compton-thick absorption or other mechanisms that regulate the SEDs of these AGN.

The potential possesses valleys of minima with classical inclination, which can be used as inflationary paths. The model is consistent with the fitting of the three-year Wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe data by the standard power-law cosmological model with cold dark matter and a cosmological constant. In particular, the spectral index turns out to be adequately small so that it is compatible with the data. Moreover, the Pati-Salam gauge group is broken to the standard model gauge group during inflation and, thus, no monopoles are formed at the end of inflation. Supergravity corrections based on a non-minimal Kaehler potential with a convenient choice of a sign keep the spectral index comfortably within the allowed range without generating maxima and minima of the potential on the inflationary path.

The novelty comes from the case of asymmetric dynamics, where the target process has a nontrivial fluctuating stationary state, whose characteristics depend on the dimensionality. In one dimension, the system remains homogeneous at any finite density. An alternating scenario however prevails in the high-density regime: typical configurations consist of long alternating sequences of highly occupied and less occupied sites. The local density of the latter is equal to ρ_c and their occupation distribution is critical. In dimension two and above, the asymmetric target process exhibits a phase transition at a threshold density ρ_0 much larger than ρ_c. The system is homogeneous at any density below ρ_0, whereas for higher densities it exhibits an extended condensate elongated along the direction of the mean current, on top of a critical background with density ρ_c.

At the time of observation, AR 8375 was young, AR 0330 mature, and AR 9575 decaying. The vertical velocity indicates that the elements of MMF pairs with polarity opposite to that of the sunspot support a downflow of around 50-100 m s^-1. The average Doppler shift difference between negative and positive elements of an MMF pair is about 150 m s^-1 in AR 8375, 100 m s^-1 in AR 0330, and 20 m s^-1 in AR 9575. These observational results are in agreement with the model that MMF pairs are part of a U-loop emanating from the sunspot's magnetic canopy. According to this model the downflow is caused by the Evershed flow returning below the solar surface. For AR 8375, the horizontal velocity of MMFs ranges from 0.1 km s^-1 to 0.7 km s^-1, and on average, the velocity of an MMF pair decreases significantly (from 0.6 km s^-1 to 0.35 km s^-1) with increasing distance from the MMF's birth place. This result suggests that the change in MMF flow speed does not reflect the radial structure of the moat flow, but rather is intrinsic to the evolution of the MMF pairs. This result is also in agreement with the U-loop model of MMF pairs. We also find that properties of MMF pairs, most strikingly the lifetime, depend on the evolution stages of the parent sunspot. The mean lifetimes of MMF pairs in ARs 9575 and 0330 are 0.7 hours and 1.6 hours, respectively, which is considerably shorter than the 4 hours lifetime previously found for AR 8375.

The gamma-ray, X-ray and UV/optical emission all showed a peak75s after the trigger, although the optical and X-ray afterglow components also appear early on - before, or during, the main peak. Spectral evolution was seen throughout the burst, with the prompt emission showing a clear positive correlation between brightness and hardness. The Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of the prompt emission, stretching from 1eV up to 1MeV, is very flat, with a peak in the flux density at1keV. The optical-to-X-ray spectra at this time are better fitted by a broken, rather than single, power-law, similar to previous results for X-ray flares. The SED shows spectral hardening as the afterglow evolves with time. This behaviour might be a symptom of self-Comptonisation, although circumstellar densities similar to those found in the cores of molecular clouds would be required. The afterglow also decays too slowly to be accounted for by the standard models. Although the precursor and main emission show different spectral lags, both are consistent with the lag-luminosity correlation for long bursts.

Such a low M_max, due to a kaon condensation in the stellar core, implies collapse of a too massive deleptonized protoneutron star into a black hole. This would naturally explain the lack of a neutron star in the SN1987A remnant. On the other hand, recent evaluation of mass of PSR J0751+1807 gives M_max > 2M_sun. This contradicts the original Bethe-Brown model, but can be reconciled within scenarios proposed in the present Letter. We consider two types of dense matter models with high-density softening, due to a transition from a non-strange N-phase of matter to a strangeness carrying phase S: kaon condensation and deconfinement of quarks. Two scenarios of neutron star formation in stellar core collapse are considered. In the first scenario, realized in sufficiently hot and dense supernova cores, nucleation of an S-phase is sufficiently rapid so as to form an S-phase core, and implying M_max = M^S_max =1.5M_sun. In the second scenario, nucleation of the S-phase at neutron star birth is too slow to materialize, and the star becomes cold without forming an S-phase core. Then, stellar mass can increase via accretion, until central density ρ_crit is reached, and the S phase forms. This N branch of neutron stars ends at M=M_crit. We select several models of N-phase satifying the necessary condition M^N_max > 2M_sun and combine them with models of kaon condensation and quark deconfinement. For kaon condensation, we get M_crit =M^S_max =1.5M_sun, which is ruled out by PSR J0751+1807.

The banana-states' Fourier-resolved spectra are well fitted by a single blackbody component with kT ∼ 2-3 keV depending on the source position in the color – color diagram and the Fourier frequency, thus indicating that this spectral component is responsible for the source variability on these timescales. This result is in approximate agreement with similar behavior exhibited by the Z sources, suggesting that, as in that case, the boundary layer – the likely source of the thermal component – is supported by radiation pressure. Furthermore, it is found that the iron line at ∼6.6 keV, clearly present in the averaged spectra, not apparent within the limitations of our measurements in the frequency-resolved spectra irrespective of the frequency range. This would indicate that this spectral component exhibits little variability on time scales comprising the interval 10^-2-10^2 seconds.

Nevertheless, the eruptive speed can be significantly enhanced after magnetic reconnection sets in. In addition, a smooth transition from slow to fast eruptions is observed when increasing the strength of the background magnetic field, simply because in a stronger field there is more free magnetic energy at the catastrophic point available to be released during an eruption.

The IHV-index for a geomagnetic element is mechanically derived from hourly values as the sum of the unsigned differences between adjacent hours over a seven-hour interval centered on local midnight. The index is derived separately for stations in both hemispheres within six longitude sectors using only local night hours. It is intended as a long-term index. Available data allows derivation of the index back well into the 19th century. On a time scale of a 27-day Bartels rotation, IHV averages for stations with corrected geomagnetic latitude less than 55 degrees are strongly correlated with midlatitude range indices. Assuming a constant calibration of the aa-index we find that observed yearly values of aa before the year 1957 are 2.9 nT too small compared to values calculated from IHV using the regression constants based on 1980-2004. We interpret this discrepancy as an indication that the calibration of the aa index is in error before 1957. There is no such problem with the ap index. Rotation averages of IHV are also strongly correlated with solar wind parameters (BV^2). On a time scale of a year combining the IHV-index and the recently-developed Inter-Diurnal Variability (IDV) index (giving B) allows determination of solar wind speed, V, from 1890-present. Over the120-year series, the yearly mean solar wind speed varied from a low of 303 km/s in 1902 to a high value of 545 km/s in 2003.

In principle the nebular ionization structure can significantly influence the y3 derived for individual sources. We find that in general there is insufficient information available to make a detailed ionization correction. Here we make a simple correction and assess its validity. The correction is based on radio recombination line measurements of H+ and 4-He+, together with simple core-halo source models. We use these models to establish criteria that allow us to identify sources that can be accurately corrected for ionization and those that cannot. We argue that this effect cannot be very large for most of the sources in our observational sample. For a wide range of models of nebular ionization structure we find that the ionization correction factor varies from 1 to 1.8.

In this paper, we suggest a particle retention mechanism which promotes the accumulation of grains and the formation of planetesimals near the water sublimation front or “snow line.” This model is based on the assumption that, in the regions most interesting for planet formation, the viscous evolution of the disk is due to turbulence driven by the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) in the surface layers of the disk. The depth to which MRI effectively generates turbulence is a strong function of the grain size and abundance. A sharp increase in the grain-to-gas density ratio across the snow line reduces the column depth of the active layer. As the disk evolves towards a quasi-steady-state, this change in the active layer creates a local maximum in radial distribution of the gas surface density and pressure, causing the gas to rotate at super-Keplerian speed and halting the inward migration of grains.

The connection between the group parameter and the Hubble constant H0 is established. It is shown that the existence of an anomalous blue-shifted frequency drift is a pure kinematic manifestation of the time inhomogeneity induced by the Universe expansion. This conclusion is confirmed via a generalization of the standard Special Relativity clock synchronization procedure to the space expanding case. The obtained formulae are in accordance with the observable Pioneer Anomaly effect. The anomalous blue-shifted drift is universal, does not depend on the presence of graviting centers and can be, in principle, observed on any frequencies under suitable experimental conditions. The explicit analytic expression for the speed of recession–intergalactic distance ratio is obtained in the form of a function of the red shift z valid in the whole range of its variation. In the small z limit this expression exactly reproduces the Hubble law. The maximum value of this function at z=0.475 quantitatively corresponds to the experimentally found value z(exp) = 0.46 +/- 0.13 of the transition from the decelerated to the accelerated expansion of the Universe.

The parameter space of the simulated clouds is consistent with all of the observed HVC complexes that have distance constraints, except the Magellanic Stream which is known to have a different origin. We also find that nearly half of these simulated halo clouds would be indistinguishable from lower-velocity gas and that this effect is strongest further from the disk of the galaxy, thus indicating a possible missing population of HVCs.

The effective formation height increases generally with wavelength and also from disk-centre towards the solar limb. The average intensity contribution functions are usually rather broad and in some cases they are even double-peaked as there are contributions from hot shock waves and cool post-shock regions in the model chromosphere. Taking into account the deviations from ionisation equilibrium for hydrogen gives a less strong variation of the electron density and with it of the optical depth. The result is a narrower formation height range. The average brightness temperature increases with wavelength and towards the limb. The relative contrast depends on wavelength in the same way as the average intensity but decreases towards the limb.

A one-zone chemical evolution model of the Milky Way for the elemental composition of the disk combined with an evolution model for its interstellar dust component similar to that of Dwek (1998) is developed. The dust model considers dust-mass return from AGB stars as calculated from synthetic AGB models combined with models for dust condensation in stellar outflows. Supernova dust formation is included in a simple parameterized form which is gauged by observed abundances of presolar dust grains with supernova origin. For dust growth in the ISM a simple method is developed for coupling this with disk and dust evolution models. The time evolution of the abundance of the following dust species is followed in the model: silicate, carbon, silicon carbide, and iron dust from AGB stars and from SNe as well as silicate, carbon, and iron dust grown in molecular clouds. It is shown that the interstellar dust population is dominated by dust accreted in molecular clouds; most of the dust material entering the Solar System at its formation does not show isotopic abundance anomalies of the refractory elements, i.e., inconspicuous isotopic abundances do not point to a Solar System origin of dust grains. The observed abundance ratios of presolar dust grains formed in SN ejecta and in AGB star outflows requires that for the ejecta from SNe the fraction of refractory elements condensed into dust is 0.15 for carbon dust and is quite small (∼10^-4) for other dust species.

We employed a computational methodology involving the integration of Fourier spectra over time to generate the cumulative spectral power. This new tool enables us to efficiently analyze large datasets, extract meaningful patterns, and provide novel insights into seismological phenomena. By applying CSP to real-world seismic data, we demonstrate its potential as a powerful diagnostic and predictive tool in seismology."}

These amplitudes are determined by a classical string solution and contain a universal exponential factor involving the action of the classical string. On the gauge theory side, expressions for perturbative amplitudes at strong coupling were previously proposed only for specific helicities of external particles – the maximally helicity violating or MHV amplitudes. These follow from the exponential ansatz of Bern, Dixon and Smirnov for MHV amplitudes in N=4 SYM. In this paper we examine the amplitudes dependence on helicities and particle-types of external states. We consider the prefactor of string amplitudes and give arguments suggesting that the prefactor at strong coupling should be the same as the Yang-Mills tree-level amplitude for the same process. This implies that scattering amplitudes in N=4 SYM simplify dramatically in the strong coupling limit. It follows from our proposal that in this limit all (MHV and non-MHV) n-point amplitudes are given by the (known) tree-level Yang-Mills result times the helicity-independent (and particle-type-independent) universal exponential.

Here we calculate the photon scattering rate profile for a single ultraviolet source. After taking into account previously neglected natural broadening of the resonance line, we find that photons approach the resonance frequency and experience most scatterings at a significantly smaller distance from the source than naively expected r=(dnu/nu_0)(c/H), where dnu=nu-nu_0 is the initial frequency offset, and the discrepancy increases as the initial frequency offset decreases. As a consequence, the scattering rate P(r) drops much faster with increasing distance than the previously assumed 1/r^2 profile. Near the source (r<1Mpc comoving), the scattering rate of photons that redshift into the Ly_alpha resonance converges to P(r) ∝r^-7/3. The scattering rate of Ly_alpha photons produced by splitting of photons that redshift into a higher resonance (Ly_gamma, Ly_delta, etc.) is only weakly affected by the radiative transfer, while the sum of scattering rates of Ly_alpha photons produced from all higher resonances also converges to P(r) ∝r^-7/3 near the source. At 15<z<35, on scales of0.01-20Mpc/h (comoving), the total scattering rate of Ly_alpha photons from all Lyman resonances is found to be higher by a factor of1+0.3[(1+z)/20]^2/3 than obtained without full radiative transfer.

We're employing a novel numerical approach that self-consistently incorporates the transfer of energy through UV radiation from background sources, such as stars and active galactic nuclei. By incorporating these effects into our simulations, we're demonstrating significant improvements in agreement with observational data. Our results show that radiative transfer can tweak spin temperatures by up to 30%, with implications for the interpretation of future 21cm surveys.

The discovery of substructure on the minor axis, together with the fact that the light profile between 0.5 < R < 1.3 follows the exponential “extended disk”, is particularly important in shedding light on the mixed and sometimes conflicting results reported in previous studies. Underlying the substructures lies a faint, metal-poor, smooth and extremely extended halo, reaching out to at least 150 kpc. The smooth halo component in M31 has a profile that can be fit with a Hernquist model of immense scale radius55 kpc, almost a factor of 4 larger than theoretical predictions. Alternatively a power-law with exponent -1.91 +/- 0.11 can be fit to the profile. The total luminosity of this structure is similar to that of the halo of the Milky Way. This vast, smooth, underlying halo is reminiscent of a classical monolithic model and completely unexpected from modern galaxy formation models. M33 is also found to have an extended metal-poor halo component, which can be fit with a Hernquist model also of scale radius55 kpc.

Alon, Benjamini, Lubetzky and Sodin studied non-backtracking random walks on regular graphs, and showed that their mixing rate may be up to twice as fast as that of the simple random walk. As an application, they showed that the maximal number of visits to a vertex, made by a non-backtracking random walk of length n on a high-girth n-vertex regular expander, is typically (1+o(1))log n/loglog n, as in the case of the balls and bins experiment. They further asked whether one can establish the precise distribution of the visits such a walk makes.In this work, we answer the above question by combining a generalized form of Brun's sieve with some extensions of the ideas in Alon et al. Let N_t denote the number of vertices visited precisely t times by a non-backtracking random walk of length n on a regular n-vertex expander of fixed degree and girth g. We prove that if g=ω(1), then for any fixed t, N_t/n is typically 1/et!+o(1). Furthermore, if g=Ω(loglog n), then N_t/n is typically 1+o(1)/et! uniformly on all t ≤ (1-o(1))log n/loglog n and 0 for all t ≥ (1+o(1))log n/loglog n. In particular, we obtain the above result on the typical maximal number of visits to a single vertex, with an improved threshold window.

We detect a strong trend for sources that are actively undergoing star-formation to have excess radio emission beyond the10^28 ergs/s/Hz level found for sources without any discernible star-formation. Furthermore, this additional radio emission correlates well with the strength of the 4000A break in the optical spectrum, and may be used to assess the age of the star-forming component. We examine two subsamples, one containing the systems with emission line ratios most like star-forming systems, and one with the sources that have characteristic AGN ratios. This division also separates the mechanism responsible for the radio emission (star-formation vs. AGN). For both cases we find a strong, almost identical, correlation between [OIII] and radio luminosity, with the AGN sample extending toward lower, and the star-formation sample toward higher luminosities. A clearer separation between the two subsamples is seen as function of the central velocity dispersion of the host galaxy.

We find that the effective temperatures, surface gravities and bolometric absolute magnitudes of He-weak stars estimated with the BCD system and the integrated flux method are in good agreement between each other, and they also agree with previous determinations based on several different methods. The mean discrepancy between the visual absolute magnitudes derived using the Hipparcos parallaxes and the BCD values is on average 0.3 mag for He-weak stars, while it is 0.5 mag for He-strong stars. For He-strong stars, we note that the BCD calibration, based on stars in the solar environment, leads to overestimated values of Teff. By means of model atmosphere calculations with enhanced He/H abundance ratios we show that larger He/H ratios produce smaller BD which naturally explains the Teff overestimation. We take advantage of these calculations to introduce a method to estimate the He/H abundance ratio in He-strong stars.

High Speed Machining highlights some drawbacks of such architectures: heavy moving parts require from the machine structure high stiffness to limit bending problems that lower the machine accuracy, and limit the dynamic performances of the feed axes. That is why PKMs attract more and more researchers and companies, because they are claimed to offer several advantages over their serial counterparts, like high structural rigidity and high dynamic capacities. Indeed, the parallel kinematic arrangement of the links provides higher stiffness and lower moving masses that reduce inertia effects. Thus, PKMs have better dynamic performances. However, the design of a parallel kinematic machine tool (PKMT) is a hard task that requires further research studies before wide industrial use can be expected. Many criteria need to be taken into account in the design of a PKMT. We pay special attention to the description of kinetostatic criteria that rely on the conditioning of the Jacobian matrix of the mechanism. The organisation of this paper is as follows: next section introduces general remarks about PKMs, then is explained why PKMs can be interesting alternative machine tool designs.

The observation of these high-redshift galaxies is a real challenge due to the faintness and sparsity of their UV emission lines, which hampers our comprehension of their physical properties. We employ deep spectroscopic surveys using 8-10 meter class telescopes and advanced computational techniques to detect and characterize the LBG population at z~5. Our analysis focuses on extracting reliable spectral features from noisy and often incomplete data sets, thereby providing a more accurate picture of galaxy evolution during this period. By leveraging novel methods for UV spectrum de-noising and feature extraction, we can accurately measure key parameters such as metallicity and kinematic properties of these high-redshift galaxies, shedding new light on the formation processes that shape their growth and development. We're essentially trying to get a better grasp of how these galaxies came to be and how they evolved over time. It's a complex puzzle, but by combining cutting-edge technology with innovative analysis techniques, we're making significant progress in understanding the early universe. On the flip side, we're also learning more about the limitations of our current methods, which is crucial for refining our approach and pushing the boundaries of what we can achieve. It's a delicate balancing act, but one that's yielding exciting results.  We're able to pinpoint specific features in the spectra that indicate the presence of certain elements, like oxygen and nitrogen, which helps us build a more detailed picture of these galaxies' composition. We're also getting a better sense of their internal dynamics, like how fast they're rotating and what kind of turbulence they're experiencing.

We first show that the language on a two letter alphabet that naturally encodes culminating paths is not context-free. Then, we focus on the enumeration of culminating paths. A step by step approach, combined with the kernel method, provides a closed form expression for the generating fucntion of culminating paths ending at a (generic) height k. In the case a=b, we derive from this expression the asymptotic behaviour of the number of culminating paths of length n. When a>b, we obtain the asymptotic behaviour by a simpler argument. When a<b, we only determine the exponential growth of the number of culminating paths. Finally, we study the uniform random generation of culminating paths via various methods. The rejection approach, coupled with a symmetry argument, gives an algorithm that is linear when a>= b, with no precomputation stage nor non-linear storage required. The choice of the best algorithm is not as clear when a<b.

It sheds new light on the age old problem by thinking of the traditional algorithms as working with images. Inspiration is drawn from an analogous situation that is found in machine and human vision. Image processing techniques are used to assist in the spatial indexing of the data. A fixed grid approach is used and bins with too many records are sub-divided hierarchically. Search queries are pre-computed for bins that do not contain any data records. This has the effect of dividing the search space up into non rectangular regions which are based on the spatial properties of the data. The bucketing quad tree can be considered as an image with a resolution of two by two for each layer. The results show that this method performs better than the quad tree if there are more divisions per layer.

We analyze O/H and S/H abundances in planetary nebulae, Hii regions, and young stars, together with known [Fe/H] abundances in the old stellar population of M33. With a theoretical model, we follow the time evolution of gas (diffuse and condensed in clouds), stars, and chemical abundances in the disk of M33, assuming that the galaxy is accreting gas from an external reservoir. Our model is able to reproduce the available observational constraints on the distribution of gas and stars in M33 and to predict the time evolution of several chemical abundances. In particular, we find that a model characterized by a continuous infall of gas on the disk, at a rate of Ṁ_ inf≈ 1 M_⊙ yr^-1, almost constant with time, can also account for the relatively high rate of star formation and for the shallow chemical gradients. Supported by a large sample of high resolution observations for this nearby galaxy, we conclude that the metallicity in the disk of M33 has increased with time at all radii, with a continuous flattening of the gradient over the last ∼ 8 Gyr.

This process has an infinitesimal generator of the form mI-(m^2/αI-Δ)^α/2, where 0<α<2, m>0, and reduces to the isotropic α-stable process for m=0. Its potential theory for open bounded sets has been well developed throughout the recent years however almost nothing was known about the behaviour of the process on unbounded sets. The present paper is intended to fill this gap and we provide two-sided sharp estimates for the Green function for a half-space. As a byproduct we obtain some improvements of the estimates known for bounded sets specially for balls. The advantage of these estimates is a clarification of the relationship between the diameter of the ball and the parameter m of the process.The main result states that the Green function is comparable with the Green function for the Brownian motion if the points are away from the boundary of a half-space and their distance is greater than one. On the other hand for the remaining points the Green function is somehow related the Green function for the isotropic α-stable process.

By advancing our knowledge in these areas, this research aims to provide a fundamental framework for interpreting the observed properties of isolated spirals, ultimately informing theoretical models and simulations that seek to elucidate their place within the broader context of cosmic structure formation."}

We find that the outflows tend to escape to low density regions, and hardly affect the dense filaments visible in HI absorption. As a result, the strength of HI absorption near galaxies is not reduced by galactic winds, but even slightly increases. We also find that a lack of HI absorption for lines of sight (LOS) close to galaxies, as found by Adelberger et al., can be created by hot gas around the galaxies induced by accretion shock heating. In contrast to HI, metal absorption systems are sensitive to the presence of winds. The models without feedback can produce the strong CIV and OVI absorption lines in LOS within 50 kpc from galaxies, while strong SN feedback is capable of creating strong CIV and OVI lines out to about twice that distance. We also analyze the mean transmissivity of HI, CIV, and OVI within 1 h^-1 Mpc from star-forming galaxies. The probability distribution of the transmissivity of HI is independent of the strength of SN feedback, but strong feedback produces LOS with lower transmissivity of metal lines. Additionally, strong feedback can produce strong OVI lines even in cases where HI absorption is weak. We conclude that OVI is probably the best tracer for galactic winds at high redshift.

The two-dimensional version of the model (one-dimensional interface) is considered, mainly in the adiabatic limit of very slow driving. On length scales shorter than a crossover length (which grows with the strength of surface tension), the effective interface roughness exponent ζ is ≃ 1.20, close to the expected value for the universality class of the quenched Edwards-Wilkinson model. We find that the waiting times between avalanches are fully uncorrelated, as the wavelet transform of their autocorrelations scales as white noise. Similarly, detrended size-size correlations give a white-noise wavelet transform.

A deep (≈ 50 ksec) exposure of TeV J2032+4130 with XMM-Newton has been obtained. The contribution of point sources to the observed X-ray emission from TeV J2032+4130 is subtracted from the data.

An extended X-ray emission region with a full width half maximum (FWHM) size of ≈ 12 arc min is found. The centroid of the emission is co-located with the position of TeV J2032+4130.The energy spectrum of the emission coinciding with the position and extension of TeV J2032+4130 can be modeled by a power-law model with a photon index Γ=1.5±0.2_stat±0.3_sys and an energy flux integrated between 2 and 10 keV of f_2-10 keV≈ 7· 10^-13 ergs/(cm^2 s) which is lower than the very high energy gamma-ray flux observed from TeV J2032+4130.

First, we study the effectiveness of CB/CT to improve the signal strength at a faraway destination using energy in nearby nodes. Then, a 2D disk case is analyzed to assess the resulting performance improvement. For general networks, if information-generation rates are fixed, the new routing problem is formulated as a linear programming problem; otherwise, the cost for routing is dynamically adjusted according to the amount of energy remaining and the effectiveness of CB/CT.

The HI synthesis observations reveal an extensive, low-surface-brightness neutral gas disk surrounding the galaxy, which we've mapped in detail. By combining these data sets, we're going to investigate the relationship between the galaxy's stellar and gaseous components, including the spatial distribution of star formation, gas density and metallicity gradients, and the impact of tidal interactions on the system. This study will contribute to a deeper understanding of dwarf irregular galaxies, providing new insights into their complex internal dynamics and evolutionary paths."}

In this paper we present the 92-cm data and a comparison is made with the already published 21-cm results. We analysed 191 pulsars at 92 cm using fluctuation spectra. The sample of pulsars is as unbiased as possible towards any particular pulsar characteristics. For 15 pulsars drifting subpulses are discovered for the first time and 26 of the new drifters found in the 21-cm data are confirmed. We discovered nulling for 8 sources and 8 pulsars are found to intermittently emit single pulses that have pulse energies similar to giant pulses. It is estimated that at least half of the total population of pulsars have drifting subpulses when observations with a high enough signal-to-noise ratio would be available. It could well be that the drifting subpulse mechanism is an intrinsic property of the emission mechanism itself, although for some pulsars it is difficult or impossible to detect. Drifting subpulses are in general found at both frequencies, although the chance of detecting drifting subpulses is possibly slightly higher at 92 cm. It appears that the youngest pulsars have the most disordered subpulses and the subpulses become more and more organized into drifting subpulses as the pulsar ages. The correlations with the modulation indices are argued to be consistent with the picture in which the radio emission can be divided in a drifting subpulse signal plus a quasi-steady signal which becomes, on average, stronger at high observing frequencies. The measured values of P3 at the two frequencies are highly correlated, but there is no evidence for a correlation with other pulsar parameters.

{"machine_text": "We investigate the phenomenon of inhomogeneities in the Universe, focusing on the Fitting Problem - a long-standing challenge in cosmology that arises from the need to reconcile observed large-scale structure with theoretical predictions. Our research aims to address this issue by developing and applying novel statistical methods to quantify and constrain inhomogeneous effects on galaxy distributions. We employ a combination of analytical modeling and numerical simulations to explore how different types of inhomogeneities, including those induced by gravitational potential fluctuations and non-linear clustering, impact the observed properties of galaxies. Our results show that these inhomogeneities can significantly affect key observables, such as galaxy clustering and redshift-space distortions. By accounting for these effects, we demonstrate that our analysis improves agreement with theoretical predictions and provides a more accurate picture of the Universe's large-scale structure, ultimately shedding new light on the fundamental nature of cosmic inhomogeneity.", "human_text": "Observational cosmology provides us with a large number of high precision data which are used to derive models trying to reproduce “on the mean” our observable patch of the Universe. Most of these attempts are achieved in the framework of a Friedmann-Lemaître cosmology where large scale homogeneity is assumed. However, we know, from the observation of structures at increasing scales, that these models are only approximations of a smoothed or averaged inhomogeneous underlying patern. Anyhow, when modelling the Universe, the usual method is to use continuous functions representing the kinematical scalars of the velocity field, implicitly assuming that they represent volume averages of the corresponding fine-scale inhomogeneous quantities, then put them into the Einstein equations which are solved to give the model and its dependance upon a number of parameters arbitrarily defined. In General Relativity, such a method is very much involved since the equations which determine the metric tensor and the quantities calculated from it are highly nonlinear. The question raised by the method consisting of determining the parameters of an a priori assumed FLRW model from observational data is the “fitting problem” brought to general attention by Ellis and Stoeger in the 80's.

The existence of gravitational radiation was first predicted by Einstein in 1916, however gravitational waves have not yet been directly observed. One source of gravitation radiation is binary inspiral. Two compact bodies orbiting each other, such as a pair of black holes, lose energy to gravitational radiation. As the system loses energy the bodies spiral towards each other. This causes their orbital speed and the amount of gravitational radiation to increase, producing a characteristic “chirp” waveform in the LIGO sensitive band. In this thesis, matched filtering of LIGO science data is used to search for low mass binary systems in the halo of dark matter surrounding the Milky Way. Observations of gravitational microlensing events of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud suggest that some fraction of the dark matter in the halo may be in the form of Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). It has been proposed that low mass black holes formed in the early universe may be a component of the MACHO population; some fraction of these black hole MACHOs will be in binary systems and detectable by LIGO. The inspiral from a MACHO binary composed of two 0.5 solar mass black holes enters the LIGO sensitive band around 40 Hz. The chirp signal increases in amplitude and frequency, sweeping through the sensitive band to 4400 Hz in 140 seconds.

Our analysis of Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams reveals a group of stars that underwent excessive mass shedding during the helium flash phase, which aligns with predictions from stellar evolution models. We also identify a substantial portion of low-mass white dwarf progenitors that went through extensive hydrogen shell burning, resulting in the formation of low-mass white dwarfs with surface gravities hovering around log(g) = 7.9. These findings suggest that mass loss on the red giant branch can play a pivotal role in shaping the properties of low-mass white dwarfs in metal-rich clusters like NGC 6791.

Here we argue that these difficulties arise owing to the significant modulation of the solar activity cycle, and that this modulation arises owing to either stochastic or deterministic processes. We analyse the implications for predictability in both of these situations by considering two separate solar dynamo models. The first model represents a stochastically-perturbed flux transport dynamo. Here even very weak stochastic perturbations can give rise to significant modulation in the activity cycle. This modulation leads to a loss of predictability. In the second model, we neglect stochastic effects and assume that generation of magnetic field in the Sun can be described by a fully deterministic nonlinear mean-field model – this is a best case scenario for prediction. We designate the output from this deterministic model (with parameters chosen to produce chaotically modulated cycles) as a target timeseries that subsequent deterministic mean-field models are required to predict. Long-term prediction is impossible even if a model that is correct in all details is utilised in the prediction. Furthermore, we show that even short-term prediction is impossible if there is a small discrepancy in the input parameters from the fiducial model. This is the case even if the predicting model has been tuned to reproduce the output of previous cycles. Given the inherent uncertainties in determining the transport coefficients and nonlinear responses for mean-field models, we argue that this makes predicting the solar cycle using the output from such models impossible.

This thermodynamic description sheds new light on the dynamics of particles in time-varying confining potentials. It specifically allows us to extract the effective depth of the ion trap as the activation energy for evaporation. As a function of the rf amplitude we find two distinct regimes related to the stability of motion of the trapped ions. For low amplitudes the entire trap allows for stable motion and the trap depth increases with the rf field. For larger rf amplitudes, however, rapid energy transfer from the field to the ion motion can occur at large trap radii, which leads to a reduction of the effective trapping volume. In this regime the trap depth decreases again with increasing rf amplitude. We give an analytical parameterization of the trap depth for various multipole traps that allows predictions of the most favorable trapping conditions.

The circumburst medium is composed of a realistically stratified stellar wind zone up to its termination shock, followed by a region of shocked wind characterized by a constant density. Aims: We followed the evolution of the blastwave through all its stages, including the extremely rapid acceleration up to a Lorentz factor 75 flow, its deceleration by interaction with stellar wind, its passage of the wind termination shock, until its propagation through shocked wind. Methods: We used the adaptive mesh refinement versatile advection code to follow the evolution of the fireball. Results: We show that the acceleration from purely thermal to ultra-relativistic kinetic regimes is abrupt and produces an internally structured blastwave. We resolved the structure of this ultra-relativistic shell in all stages, thanks to the adaptive mesh. We comment on the dynamical roles played by forward and reverse shock pairs in the phase of interaction with the free stellar wind and clearly identify the complex shock-dominated structure created when the shell crosses the terminal shock.

Among these, the most striking is oxygen depletion, which reaches values down to [O/Fe] -0.4 in most clusters, but in M13 it goes down to less than [O/Fe]- 1. In this work we suggest that the anomalies are due to the super position of two different events: 1) PRIMORDIAL SELF-ENRICHMENT: this is asked to explain the oxygen depletion down to a minimum value [O/Fe]-0.4; 2) EXTRA MIXING IN A FRACTION OF THE STARS ALREADY BORN WITH ANOMALOUS COMPOSITION: these objects, starting with already low [O/Fe], will reduce the oxygen abundance down to the most extreme values. Contrary to other models that invoke extra mixing to explain the chemical anomalies, we suggest that it is active only if there is a fraction of the stars in which the primordial composition is not only oxygen depleted, but also extremely helium rich (Y0.4), as found in a few GCs from their main sequence multiplicity. We propose that the rotational evolution (and an associated extra mixing) of extremely helium rich stars may be affected by the fact that they develop a very small or non existent molecular weight barrier during the evolution. We show that extra mixing in these stars, having initial chemistry that has already been CNO processed, affects mainly the oxygen abundance, and to a much smaller extent if affects the sodium abundance. The model also predicts a large fluorine depletion concomitant with the oxygen depletion, and a further enhancement of the surface helium abundance, which reaches values close to Y=0.5 in the computed models.

Measured velocity dispersions are 130-340 km/s with a mean of 216 km/s.

We convert [OII] and [OIII] emission-line luminosities to photoionizing luminosity under the assumption that the gas is ionized by the nuclear UV continuum. Most of the galaxies with FRI morphology and/or low-excitation emission-line spectra have progressively lower BH masses at lower photoionizing (and jet) luminosities. This agrees with the Ledlow-Owen relation which states that the radio luminosity at the FRI/FRII transition depends on the optical luminosity of the host, L_radioL_optical^1.8, because both L_radio and L_optical relate to AGN nuclear parameters. When recasting the Ledlow-Owen relation into BH mass versus photoionizing and jet luminosity, we find that the recasted relation describes the sample quite well. The FRI/FRII transition occurs at approximately an order of magnitude lower luminosity relative to the Eddington luminosity than the soft-to-hard transition in X-ray binaries.

We use these methods in the analysis of Atomic Weights and of Mass Number of atomic nuclei. Using the AutoCorrelation Function and Mutual Information we establish the presence of nonlinear effects in the mechanism of increasing mass of atomic nuclei considered as a function of the atomic number. We find that increasing mass is divergent, possibly chaotic. We also investigate the possible existence of a Power Law for atomic nuclei and, using also the technique of the variogram, we conclude that a fractal regime could superintend to the mechanism of increasing mass for nuclei. Finally, using the Hurst exponent, evidence is obtained that the mechanism of increasing mass in atomic nuclei is in the fractional Brownian regime. The most interesting results are obtained by using Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA). New recurrences, psudoperiodicities, self-resemblance and class of self-similarities are identified with values of determinism showing oscillating values indicating the presence of more or less stability during the process of increasing mass of atomic nuclei. In brief, new regimes of regularities are identified for atomic nuclei that deserve to be studied by future researches.

This type of frequency scaling cannot be accounted for by traditional models, as either single-compartment models or models based on reconstructed cell morphologies display a frequency scaling with a slope close to -4. This slope is due to the fact that the membrane resistance is 'short-circuited' by the capacitance for high frequencies, a situation which may not be realistic. Here, we integrate non-ideal capacitors in cable equations to reflect the fact that the capacitance cannot be charged instantaneously. We show that the resulting 'non-ideal' cable model can be solved analytically using Fourier transforms. Numerical simulations using a ball-and-stick model yield membrane potential activity with similar frequency scaling as in the experiments. We also discuss the consequences of using non-ideal capacitors on other cellular properties such as the transmission of high frequencies, which is boosted in non-ideal cables, or voltage attenuation in dendrites.

A strong soft excess below 1 keV is observed in the time-averaged HETG spectrum, which can be parameterized with a steep power law or a thermal model.

For relatively short periods and small enough amplitudes the system becomes trapped either at low or high Ag coverage states, as evidenced by recording hysteresis loops. This scenario is identified as dynamically ordered states (DOS), such that the relaxation time (τ_relax) of the corresponding metastable state obeys τ_relax > τ. On the other hand, by properly increasing μ_o or/and τ, one finds that the Ag coverage gently follows the external drive (here τ_relax < τ) and the system is said to enter into dynamically disordered states (DDS), where hysteresis loops show almost symmetric limiting cycles. This symmetry breaking between limiting cycles driven by an external signal is discussed in terms of the concept of (out-of-equilibrium) Dynamic Phase Transitions between DOS and DDS, similar to those encountered when a magnetic system is placed in the presence of a variable external magnetic field. However, a careful finite-size scaling study reveals that, at least at T = 300K, the Ag/Au(100) system does not exhibit true second-order phase transitions but rather a crossover behavior between states.

Quantitative description of the experiments is possible through an stochastic branching process which corroborates the importance of heterogeneity.

By examining the reduced density matrices obtained from the global state via the partial trace operation, we've developed a necessary condition for separability that's all about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of these reduced matrices. The key takeaway is that we can identify separable states in multipartite quantum systems by analyzing the properties of the Bloch vectors associated with each subsystem. In other words, we can figure out whether the overall system is composed of genuinely separate parts or exhibits entangled behavior.

We present optical observations of the afterglow of GRB 050724 and of its host galaxy, significantly expanding the existing dataset for this event. We compare our results with models, complementing them with available measurements from the literature. We study the afterglow light curve and spectrum including X-ray data. We also present observations of the host galaxy. The observed optical emission was likely related to the large flare observed in the X-ray light curve. The apparent steep decay was therefore not due to the jet effect. Available data are indeed consistent with low collimation, in turn implying a large energy release, comparable to that of long GRBs. The flare properties also constrain the internal shock mechanism, requiring a large Lorentz factor contrast between the colliding shells. This implies that the central engine was active at late times, rather than ejecting all shells simultaneously. The host galaxy has red colors and no ongoing star formation, consistent with previous findings on this GRB. However, it is not a pure elliptical, and has some faint spiral structure.

We consider mixtures with rods of different aspect ratios and spheres of different diameters, and we treat them within Onsager theory. Our results indicate that depletion effects, and consequently smectic stability, decrease significantly as a result of orientational disorder in the smectic phase when compared with corresponding data based on the frozen–orientation approximation. These results are discussed in terms of the τ parameter, which has been proposed as a convenient measure of depletion strength. We present closed expressions for τ, and show that it is intimately connected with the depletion potential. We then analyse the effect of particle geometry by comparing results pertaining to systems of parallel rods of different shapes (spherocylinders, cylinders and parallelepipeds). We finally provide results based on the Zwanzig approximation of a Fundamental–Measure density–functional theory applied to mixtures of parallelepipeds and cubes of different sizes.

Consistency requires that the corresponding box measurements be complementary as well. At first sight it seems, however, that these measurements can be jointly performed with arbitrary precision: they pertain to different systems (the center of mass of the box and an internal clock, respectively). But this is deceptive. As we show by explicit calculation, although the relevant quantities are simultaneously measurable, they develop non-vanishing commutators when calculated back to the time of escape of the photon. This justifies Bohr's qualitative arguments in a precise way; and it illustrates how the details of the dynamics conspire to guarantee the requirements of complementarity. In addition, our calculations exhibit a “fine structure” in the distribution of the uncertainties over the complementary quantities: depending on when the box measurement is performed, the resulting quantum description of the photon differs.

Similarly, we find that the exponents of the third order structure functions for u stay equal to unity for the all the Mach numbers studied. The scaling of higher order correlations obeys the She-Leveque (1994) scalings corresponding to the two-dimensional dissipative structures, and this result does not change with the Mach number either. In contrast to v which exhibits different scaling parallel and perpendicular to the local magnetic field, the scaling of u is similar in both directions. In addition, we find that the peaks of density create a hierarchy in which both physical and column densities decrease with the scale in accordance to the Fleck (1996) predictions. This hierarchy can be related ubiquitous small ionized and neutral structures (SINS) in the interstellar gas.

Our targets are 74 F-M dwarfs in the young stellar associations Eta Cha, TW Hydrae, Beta Pic, and Tuc-Hor, spanning ages from 6 to 30 Myr. While the Halpha EW for most F and G stars are consistent with pure photospheric absorption, most K and M stars show chromospheric emission. By comparing Halpha EW in our sample to results in the literature, we see a clear evolutionary sequence: Chromospheric activity declines steadily from the T Tauri phase to the main sequence. Using activity as an age indicator, we find a plausible age range for the Tuc-Hor association of 10-40 Myr. Between 5 and 30 Myr, we do not see evidence for rotational braking in the total sample, thus angular momentum is conserved, in contrast to younger stars. This difference indicates a change in the rotational regulation at 5-10 Myr, possibly because disk braking cannot operate longer than typical disk lifetimes, allowing the objects to spin up. The rotation-activity relation is flat in our sample; in contrast to main-sequence stars, there is no linear correlation for slow rotators. We argue that this is because young stars generate their magnetic fields in a fundamentally different way from main-sequence stars, and not just the result of a saturated solar-type dynamo. By comparing our rotational velocities with published rotation periods for a subset of stars, we determine ages of 13 (7-20) Myr and 9 (7-17 Myr for the Eta Cha and TWA associations, respectively, consistent with previous estimates.

In 3D Lennard-Jones-like particles are used to represent single cells, and their evolution in response to signalling is followed by molecular dynamics. It is found that if a single cell is able to emit a signal which induces others to move towards it, then a colony of single-cell organisms can assemble into shapes as complex as a tower, a ball atop a stalk, or a fast-moving slug.

The derived results confirm that no single star formation history explains the diverse sets of abundance patterns in DLAs. We demonstrate that the various star formation histories reproducing the DLA abundance patterns are typical of local irregular, dwarf starburst and quiescent spiral galaxies. Independent of the star formation history, the DLAs have a common characteristic of being weak star forming galaxies; models with high star formation efficiencies are ruled out. All the derived DLA star formation rates per unit area are moderate or low, with values between -3.2 < log SFR < -1.1 M_sol yr^-1 kpc^-2.

Next we demonstrate that the same Weyl types characterize warped product spacetimes with a one-dimensional Lorentzian (timelike) factor, whereas warped spacetimes with a two-dimensional Lorentzian factor are restricted to the types D or O. By exploring the Bianchi identities, we then analyze the simplest non-trivial case from the above classes - type D vacuum spacetimes, possibly with a cosmological constant, dropping, however, the assumptions that the spacetime is static, stationary or warped. It is shown that for “generic” type D vacuum spacetimes the corresponding principal null directions are geodetic in any dimension (this applies also to type II spacetimes). For n>=5, however, there may exist particular cases of type D spacetimes which admit non-geodetic multiple principal null directions and we present such examples in any n>=7. Further studies are restricted to five dimensions, where the type D Weyl tensor is described by a 3x3 matrix Φ_ij. In the case with “twistfree” (A_ij=0) principal null geodesics we show that in a “generic” case Φ_ij is symmetric and eigenvectors of Φ_ij coincide with those of the expansion matrix S_ij, providing us with three preferred spacelike directions of the spacetime.

These observations demonstrate that Vegard's law is not obeyed in the MgAl2O4-MgCr2O4 solid solution. Despite some angular site distortion, the local D3d symmetry of the B-site of the spinel structure is retained during the substitution of Cr for Al. Here, we show that the relaxation is accomodated by strain-induced bond buckling, with angular tilts of the Mg-centred tetrahedra around the Cr-centred octahedron. By contrast, there is no significant alteration of the angles between the edge-sharing octahedra, which build chains aligned along the three four-fold axes of the cubic structure.

The near-UV spectrum is dominated by very strong FeII and FeIII, and unusual low-ionization lines such as NaID and CaII HK are observed. High-ionization lines are very weak; CIV has an equivalent width of 6.6A, a factor of5 smaller than measured from quasar composite spectra. An unusual feature near 1200A can be deblended in terms of Lyα, NV, SiII, and CIII* using the blueshifted CIV profile as a template. Photoionization modeling shows that the unusual line emission can be explained qualitatively by the unusually soft SED. Principally, a low gas temperature results in inefficient emission of collisionally excited lines, including the semiforbidden lines generally used as density diagnostics. The emission resembles that of high-density gas; in both cases this is a consequence of inefficient cooling.

The mechanical strength of the surface is given only by skeletons, and no two-dimensional bending energy is assumed in the Hamiltonian. The skeletons are composed of elastic linear-chains and rigid junctions and form a compartmentalized structure on the surface, and for this reason the vertices of triangles can diffuse freely only inside the compartments.

We also find that the combination of these two processes can lead to more efficient particle acceleration and heating, highlighting the importance of considering both mechanisms simultaneously in understanding CME dynamics."}

The main goal is to settle the debate about the origin and distribution of SiO masers in evolved stars, especially in R Leo's unique situation where its asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star and white dwarf companion are having a wild dance. We combined high-resolution interferometric observations with radiative transfer modeling to figure out the spatial structure and properties of the circumstellar SiO maser emission. Our results show that the masers are contained within a region around the AGB star, stretching out about 100 AU, suggesting a possible link between the maser emission and the stellar wind dynamics in this system. This research contributes a lot to our understanding of the maser phenomenon in evolved stars and sheds new light on the intricate interplay between the stellar and circumstellar environments."}

In two dimensions (2D) both superconductivity and charge-density waves (CDW) are believed to be anomalous. In superconducting cuprates, critical transition temperatures are unusually high and the energy gap may stay unclosed even above these temperatures (pseudogap). In CDW-bearing dichalcogenides the resistivity below the transition can decrease with temperature even faster than in the normal phase and a basic prerequisite for the CDW, the favourable nesting conditions (when some sections of the Fermi surface appear shifted by the same vector), seems to be absent. Notwithstanding the existence of alternatives to conventional theories, both phenomena in 2D still remain the most fascinating puzzles in condensed matter physics. Using the latest developments in high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) here we show that the normal-state pseudogap also exists in one of the most studied 2D examples, dichalcogenide 2H-TaSe2, and the formation of CDW is driven by a conventional nesting instability, which is masked by the pseudogap. Our findings reconcile and explain a number of unusual, as previously believed, experimental responses as well as disprove many alternative theoretical approaches.

We present a new planet detection method that is capable of making large advances towards both of these objectives and describe a modest network of telescopes that is able to make the requisite observations. In a system where a known planet transits its host star, a second planet in that system will cause the time between transits to vary. These transit timing variations can be used to infer the orbital elements and mass of the perturbing planet even if it has a mass that is smaller than the mass of the Earth. This detection technique complements other techniques because it is most sensitive in mean-motion resonances where, due to degeneracies, other techniques have reduced sensitivity. Small ground-based observatories have already exceeded the photometric precision necessary to detect sub-Earth mass planets. However, TTV planet searches are currently limited by the relatively small number of high-precision transit data and insufficient observing time on existing telescopes. These issues will be compounded as the number of known transiting planets suitable for TTV study will increase substantially in the near future.

We find that intervening metal systems are the norm in both GRB and QSO sight-lines, with properties that match up with what we'd expect for the IGM. It seems like these metal systems are just a normal part of the IGM's makeup, and studying them can give us a better understanding of how the universe evolved over time. We're able to make these findings by comparing the properties of the intervening metal systems in GRB and QSO sight-lines, and we're excited to see what other secrets the IGM might hold.

Millimeter dust emission can also be used as a dense gas tracer and could unveil H2 envelopes lacking CO. These different tracers must be compared in different environments. This study compares virial masses to masses deduced from millimeter emission, in two GMC samples: the local molecular clouds in our Galaxy and their equivalents in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), one of the nearest low metallicity dwarf galaxy. In our Galaxy, mass estimates deduced from millimeter emission are consistent with masses deduced from gamma ray analysis and trace the total mass of the clouds. Virial masses are systematically larger (twice on average) than mass estimates from millimeter dust emission. This difference decreases toward high masses and has already been reported in previous studies. In the SMC however, molecular cloud masses deduced from SIMBA millimeter observations are systematically higher (twice on average for conservative values of the dust to gas ratio and dust emissivity) than the virial masses from SEST CO observations. The observed excess can not be accounted for by any plausible change of dust properties. Taking a general form for the virial theorem, we show that a magnetic field strength of15 micro Gauss in SMC clouds could provide additional support to the clouds and explain the difference observed.

The high resolution images show no clear evidence of a disk, aligned nearly east-west and perpendicular to the radio jet axis, as suggested by previous observations, but show two separate features located on the eastern and western sides of the nucleus. The western feature shows an elongated structure along the jet and a good velocity correspondence with optical emission lines associated with the jet, suggesting that this feature is a jet-entrained gas. The eastern feature is elongated nearly east-west ending around the nucleus. A velocity gradient appears in the same direction with increasingly blueshifted velocities near the nucleus. This velocity gradient is in the opposite sense of that previously inferred for the putative circumnuclear disk.

This is a state in which the energy density can be made arbitrarily negative over an arbitrarily large region of space, but only at one instant in time. In the Helfer state, the negative energy density is accompanied by rapidly time-varying energy fluxes. It is the latter feature which allows the quantum inequalities, bounds which restrict the magnitude and duration of negative energy, to hold for this class of states. An observer who initially passes through the negative energy region will quickly encounter fluxes of positive energy which subsequently enter the region. We examine in detail the correlation between the energy density and flux in the Helfer state in terms of their expectation values. We then study the correlation function between energy density and flux in the Minkowski vacuum state, for a massless minimally coupled scalar field in both two and four dimensions. In this latter analysis we examine correlation functions rather than expectation values. Remarkably, we see qualitatively similar behavior to that in the Helfer state. More specifically, an initial negative energy vacuum fluctuation in some region of space is correlated with a subsequent flux fluctuation of positive energy into the region.

If the slope of the linear relation (β) between SN color excess and luminosity is fit empirically, then the bubble disappears. If, on the other hand, the color excess arises purely from Milky Way-like dust, then SN data clearly favors a Hubble bubble. We demonstrate that SN data give β≃ 2, instead of the β≃ 4 one would expect from purely Milky-Way-like dust. This suggests that either SN intrinsic colors are more complicated than can be described with a single light-curve shape parameter, or that dust around SN is unusual.

We give simple expressions, explicitly dependent on the particle density, for the evolution of power in each mode as a function of red-shift. For typical starting red-shifts the effect of finite particle number is to slow down slightly the growth of power compared to that in the fluid limit (e.g. by about ten percent at half the Nyquist frequency), and to induce also dispersion in the growth as a function of direction at a comparable level. In the limit that the initial red-shift tends to infinity, at fixed particle density, the evolution in fact diverges from that in the fluid limit (described by the Zeldovich approximation). Contrary to widely held belief, this means that a simulation started at a red-shift much higher than the red-shift of shell crossing actually gives a worse, rather than a better, result. We also study how these effects are modified when there is a small-scale regularization of the gravitational force. We show that such a smoothing may reduce the anisotropy of the discreteness effects, but it then increases their average effect. This behaviour illustrates the fact that the discreteness effects described here are distinct from those usually considered in this context, due to two-body collisions. Indeed the characteristic time for divergence from the collisionless limit is proportional to N^2/3, rather than N/ log N in the latter case.

The most interesting case occurs when the magnetic field is perpendicular to the Rashba field. Then, the spins of the asymptotic wavefunctions are not eigenfunctions of the Rashba Hamiltonian and the resulting coupling between spins in the Rashba region gives rise to sudden changes of the transmission probability when the Fermi energy is swept along the gap.

Namely, we define an algebra as the quotient of the free tensor algebra T(V^*) by relations x_i⊗ x_j-x_j⊗ x_i=R_ij(ħ) where R_ij(ħ)∈ T(V^*)⊗ħℂ[[ħ]], R_ij=ħ(α_ij)+𝒪(ħ^2), with one relation for each pair of i,j=1...

Despite this, the main sequence, sub-giant branch, and red giant branch are all narrow and well-defined, and the red clump is compact. We examine the spatial distribution of turn-off stars and demonstrate that all belong to NGC 1846 rather than to any field star population. In addition, the spatial distributions of the two sets of turn-off stars may exhibit different central concentrations and some asymmetries. By fitting isochrones, we show that the properties of the colour-magnitude diagram can be explained if there are two stellar populations of equivalent metal abundance in NGC 1846, differing in age by approximately 300 Myr. The absolute ages of the two populations are1.9 and2.2 Gyr, although there may be a systematic error of up to +/-0.4 Gyr in these values. The metal abundance inferred from isochrone fitting is [M/H]-0.40, consistent with spectroscopic measurements of [Fe/H].

Recently Molinari and Molinari developed a methodology that shows the h-index has a universal growth rate for large numbers of papers, allowing for meaningful comparisons between institutions.An additional challenge when comparing large institutions is that fields have distinct internal cultures, with different typical rates of publication and citation; biology is more highly cited than physics, which is more highly cited than engineering. For this reason, this study has focused on the physical sciences, engineering, and technology, and has excluded bio-medical research. Comparisons between individual disciplines are reported here to provide contextual framework.

A scenario interprets the ankle as the transition from Galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays (ankle-transition scenario), while the other is that the dip caused by pair production on the cosmic microwave background radiation (proton-dip scenario). In this paper, we consider whether cosmogenic neutrinos can be a clue to judge which scenario is favored. We calculated the fluxes of cosmogenic neutrinos following these scenarios with plausible physical parameter sets, and found several important features as follows. First of all, the neutrino flux at ∼ 10^20 eV becomes much higher in the ankle-transition scenario as long as the maximum energy of the cosmic rays at sources is sufficiently high. On the other hand, the neutrino spectrum has a characteristic peak at ∼ 10^16 eV in the proton-dip scenario on the condition that extragalactic protons significantly contribute to the observed cosmic rays down to 10^17 eV. Thus, we conclude cosmogenic neutrinos should give us a clue to judge which scenario is favored, unless these features are masked by the neutrino background coming from possible, powerful neutrino sources such as AGNs and GRBs. We also found an interesting feature that the neutrino flux at ∼ 10^18 eV depends only on the cosmological evolution of the cosmic ray sources. That means cosmogenic neutrinos with the energy bring us information on the cosmological evolution of the sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. Finally, we compare the fluxes of cosmogenic neutrinos with the expected sensitivity curves of several neutrino detectors, and conclude the detection of cosmogenic neutrinos in the near future is promising.

It is different from most works in literature where p≡q. The analysis for unequal dimensional quantization is based on the volume of a metric ball in G_n,p(L) whose center is in G_n,q(L). Our chief result is a closed-form formula for the volume of a metric ball when the radius is sufficiently small. This volume formula holds for Grassmann manifolds with arbitrary n, p, q and L, while previous results pertained only to some special cases. Based on this volume formula, several bounds are derived for the rate distortion tradeoff assuming the quantization rate is sufficiently high. The lower and upper bounds on the distortion rate function are asymptotically identical, and so precisely quantify the asymptotic rate distortion tradeoff. We also show that random codes are asymptotically optimal in the sense that they achieve the minimum achievable distortion with probability one as n and the code rate approach infinity linearly. Finally, we discuss some applications of the derived results to communication theory.

Essentially, our research suggests that the traditional single-parameter approach to SNe Ia might be too simplistic and potentially biased towards specific sub-classes of these events, which is a major wake-up call for scientists in the field. We're essentially saying that SNe Ia are not all created equal, and that there's more to them than meets the eye. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the universe, and we're excited to see where this research takes us."}

It is shown that for flows with arbitrary shearing rate there exists a finite time interval of non-adiabatic evolution of the perturbations. The non-adiabatic behavior manifests itself in a twofold way, viz. by the over-reflection of the GAWs and by the generation of GAWs from EM perturbations.

Efficient generation of GAW by EM takes place for shearing rates about an order of magnitude smaller than necessary for development of a shear instability.

In the model, the utility function of each node is given by a weighted sum of contributions from all accessible nodes. The weights, parameterized by the variable δ, decrease with distance. We introduce a growth mechanism where new nodes attach to the existing network preferentially by utility. By increasing δ, the network structure evolves from a power-law to an exponential degree distribution, passing through a regime characterised by shorter average path length, lower degree assortativity and higher central point dominance. In the second part of the paper we compare different network structures in terms of the average utility received by each node. We show that power-law networks provide higher average utility than Poisson random networks. This provides a possible justification for the ubiquitousness of scale-free networks in the real world.

We examine how and when 'pasted' or 'patched' domain walls are formed, how long such walls evolve in the long run, and we believe that the significant portion of dark matter could be accounted for in terms of such domain-wall structure and its remnants. Of course, the cosmological QCD phase transition happened in the way such that the false vacua associated with baryons and many other color-singlet objects did not disappear (that is, using the bag-model language, there are bags of radius 1.0 fermi for the baryons) - but the amount of the energy remained in the false vacua is negligible. The latent energy released due to the conversion of the false vacua to the true vacua, in the form of 'pasted' or 'patched' domain walls in the short run and their numerous evolved objects, should make the concept of the 'radiation-dominated' epoch, or of the 'matter-dominated' epoch to be re-examined.

Yet, ellipticals, especially luminous ones, show little signs of recent star formation (SF). To investigate the possible cause of the dearth of SF in these systems, we study the gravitational stability of CN gas disks embedded within the potentials of both the stellar bulge and the central massive black hole (BH) in ellipticals. We find that CN disks in higher mass galaxies are generally more stable than those in lower mass galaxies, because higher mass galaxies tend to have more massive BHs and more centrally concentrated stellar density profiles. We also consider the case in which the central stellar density profile has a core, which is often observed for ellipticals whose total stellar mass is higher than about 10^11 Msun. Such a cored stellar density profile leads to more unstable CN disks than the power-law density profile characteristic of less massive galaxies. However, the more massive BHs in high-mass galaxies act to stabilize the CN disk. Our results demonstrate that the gravitational potentials of both the central BH and the stellar component should be taken into account when studying the properties of CN disks, as their stability is sensitive to both the BH mass and the stellar density profile. Our results could explain the observed trend that less luminous ellipticals have a greater tendency to exhibit ongoing SF than giant ellipticals.

Modified surface abundances are preferred in only a minority of cases for luminosity class II, possibly indicating mixing in excess of standard first dredge-up.Supergiant stars show a larger variety of near-IR spectra, and good fits are currently obtained for about one third of the observations only. Modified surface abundances help reproducing strong CN bands, but do not suffice to resolve all the difficulties.

Seismic activity is generically suppressed just before the mainshock in a close vicinity of the epicenter of the upcoming event while it remains to be active in the surroundings (the Mogi doughnut).

We examine its nature and surroundings by analyzing the projected galaxy distribution, the galaxy velocity distribution, the weak-lensing mass reconstruction, and the X-ray spectroscopy and imaging. The cluster shows a complex morphology. It is composed by at least two structures along the line-of-sight, with velocity dispersions of 592+-82 km s^-1 and 391+-85 km s^-1 respectively. Other structures are also detected in X-ray, in the galaxy projected number density map, and by weak-lensing. One of these clumps, could be gravitationally bound and associated to the main cluster. The derived temperature and bolometric X-ray luminosity reveal that [VMF 98] 097 behave like a normal cluster, in agreement with Lx-Tx correlation found for both local (z=0) and moderate redshift (z 0.4) clusters. We find that the mass determination inferred from weak-lensing is in average 3 to 4.8 times higher (depending on the model assumed) than the X-ray mass. We have two possible explanations for this discrepancy: i) the cluster is in non-equilibrium, then the deviation of the X-ray estimated mass from the true value can be as high as a factor of two; ii) the intervening mass along the line-of-sight of the cluster is producing an over-estimation of the weak-lensing mass.

Sampling is commonly applied on routers in order to limit the load incurred by the collection of information that the router has to undertake when evaluating flow information for monitoring purposes. The sampling process in nearly all cases is a deterministic process of choosing 1 in every N packets on a per-interface basis, and then forming the flow statistics based on the collected sampled statistics. Even though this sampling may not be significant for some statistics, such as packet rate, others can be severely distorted. However, it is important to consider the sampling techniques and their relative accuracy when applied to different traffic patterns. The main disadvantage of sampling is the loss of accuracy in the collected trace when compared to the original traffic stream. To date there has not been a detailed analysis of the impact of sampling at a router in various traffic profiles and flow criteria. In this paper, we assess the performance of the sampling process as used in NetFlow in detail, and we discuss some techniques for the compensation of loss of monitoring detail.

We find that the baryon mass fraction (f_b) within r500 is constant for systems with M500 between 6e13 and 1e15 Msun. Although f_b is lower than the WMAP value, the shortfall is on the order of both the observational systematic uncertainties and the depletion of baryons within r500 that is predicted by simulations. The data therefore provide no compelling evidence for undetected baryonic components, particularly any that vary in importance with cluster mass. A unique feature of the current analysis is direct inclusion of the contribution of intracluster light (ICL) in the baryon budget. The increase in X-ray gas mass fraction with increasing total mass is entirely accounted for by a decrease in the total stellar mass fraction, supporting the argument that the behavior of both the stellar and X-ray gas components is dominated by a decrease in star formation efficiency in more massive environments. Within just the stellar component, the fraction of the total stellar luminosity in the BCG and ICL decreases as velocity dispersion increases, suggesting that the BCG+ICL component, and in particular the dominant ICL component, grows less efficiently in higher mass environments. The degree to which this behavior arises from our sample selection, which favored systems with central, giant elliptical galaxies, remains unclear.

The utility function considered here measures the number of reliable bits that are transmitted per joule of energy consumed and, hence, is particulary suitable for energy-constrained networks. The actions available to each user in trying to maximize its own utility are at least the choice of the transmit power and, depending on the situation, the user may also be able to choose its transmission rate, modulation, packet size, multiuser receiver, multi-antenna processing algorithm, or carrier allocation strategy. The best-response strategy and Nash equilibrium for each game is presented.

At the cellular level, such adjustment relies on the transcription factors (TFs) which must rapidly find their target sequences amidst a vast amount of non-relevant sequences on DNA molecules. Whether these transcription factors locate their target sites through a 1D or 3D pathway is still a matter of speculation. It has been suggested that the optimum search time is when the protein equally shares its search time between 1D and 3D diffusions. In this paper, we study the above problem using a Monte Carlo simulation by considering a very simple physical model. A 1D strip, representing a DNA, with a number of low affinity sites, corresponding to non-target sites, and high affinity sites, corresponding to target sites, is considered and later extended to a 2D strip. We study the 1D and 3D exploration pathways, and combinations of the two modes by considering three different types of molecules: a walker that randomly walks along the strip with no dissociation; a jumper that represents dissociation and then re-association of a TF with the strip at later time at a distant site; and a hopper that is similar to the jumper but it dissociates and then re-associates at a faster rate than the jumper.

The flares were sometimes intense, had rapid rise and decay phases, and occurred late relative to the “prompt” phase. Some remarkable flares are observed with fluence comparable to the prompt GRB fluence. Many GRBs have several flares, which are sometimes overlapping. Short, intense, repetitive, and late flaring can be most easily understood within the context of the standard fireball model with the internal engine that powers the prompt GRB emission in an active state at late times. However, other models for flares have been proposed. Flare origin can be investigated by comparing the flare spectra to that of the afterglow and the initial prompt emission. In this work, we have analyzed all significant X-ray flares from the first 110 GRBs observed by Swift. From this sample 33 GRBs were found to have significant X-ray flares, with 77 flares that were detected above the 3σ level. In addition to temporal analysis presented in a companion paper, a variety of spectral models have been fit to each flare. In some cases, we find that the spectral fits favor a Band function model, which is more akin to the prompt emission than to that of an afterglow. We find that the average fluence of the flares is 2.4e-7 erg/cm^2/s in the 0.2-10 keV energy band, which is approximately a factor of ten below the average prompt GRB fluence. These results, when combined with those presented in the companion paper on temporal properties of flares, supports the hypothesis that most X-ray flares are late-time activity of the internal engine that spawned the initial GRB; not an afterglow related effect.

The method is designed to eliminate the problems inherent in the rate-equation formalism to surface chemistry. Here we report the first use of this method in a chemical model of cold interstellar cloud cores that includes both gas-phase and surface chemistry. The surface chemical network consists of a small number of diffusive reactions that can produce molecular oxygen, water, carbon dioxide, formaldehyde, methanol and assorted radicals. METHOD: The simulation is started by running a gas-phase model including accretion onto grains but no surface chemistry or evaporation. The starting surface consists of either flat or rough olivine. We introduce the surface chemistry of the three species H, O and CO in an iterative manner using our stochastic technique. Under the conditions of the simulation, only atomic hydrogen can evaporate to a significant extent. Although it has little effect on other gas-phase species, the evaporation of atomic hydrogen changes its gas-phase abundance, which in turn changes the flux of atomic hydrogen onto grains. The effect on the surface chemistry is treated until convergence occurs. We neglect all non-thermal desorptive processes. RESULTS: We determine the mantle abundances of assorted molecules as a function of time through 2x10^5 yr. Our method also allows determination of the abundance of each molecule in specific monolayers.

Recent high-resolution radio observations showing a putative 'cometary tail' pointing away from the Be star near periastron have been cited as support for the pulsar-wind model. We wish here to carry out a quantitative assessment of these competing models for this extraordinary source. We apply a 3D SPH code for dynamical simulations of both the pulsar-wind-interaction and accretion-jet models. The former yields a description of the shape of the wind-wind interaction surface. The latter provides an estimation of the accretion rate. The results allow critical evaluation of how the two distinct models confront the data in various wavebands under a range of conditions. When one accounts for the 3D dynamical wind interaction under realistic constraints for the relative strength of the B-star and pulsar winds, the resulting form of the interaction front does not match the putative 'cometary tail' claimed from radio observations. On the other hand, dynamical simulations of the accretion-jet model indicate that the orbital phase variation of accretion power includes a secondary broad peak well away from periastron, thus providing a plausible way to explain the observed TeV gamma ray emission toward apastron.

The most elementary properties, directly adapted from the case of varieties without orbifold structure, are established here. The arguments of [Ca01] can then be directly adapted to extend the main structure results to this orbifold category. We hope to come back to deeper aspects later. The motivation is that the natural frame for the theory of classification of compact Kähler (and complex projective) manifolds includes at least the category of orbifolds, as shown in [Ca01] by the fonctorial decomposition of special manifolds as tower of orbifolds with either κ_+=-∞ or κ=0, and also, seemingly, by the minimal model program, in which most proofs work only after the adjunction of a 'boundary'.Also, fibrations enjoy in the bimeromorphic category of geometric orbifolds extension properties not satisfied in the category of varieties without orbifold structure, permitting to express invariants of the total space from those of the generic fibre and of the base. For example, the natural sequence of fundamental groups is exact there; also the total space is special if so are the generic fibre and the base.

The high temperature (56 K) of the best fit Bonnor-Ebert model is in contradiction with the CO and thermal continuum data, leading to the conclusion that the thermal pressure is not enough to prevent free-fall collapse. We also find that the turbulence in the cloud is inadequate to support it. However, the cloud may be supported by the magnetic field, if this field is at the average level for dark globules.

To tackle this problem, we're employing a one-dimensional, vertically integrated model that takes into account both radiative and viscous heating, as well as Comptonization effects on the thermal structure of the disk. Our approach involves solving the system of equations governing the disk's thermodynamic evolution, including the energy balance equation, the momentum equation, and the equation of state, which describe the interplay between radiation pressure, gas pressure, and temperature in the disk annulus. The resulting surface structure is characterized by a transition from a hot, optically thick region near the inner edge to a cooler, partially ionized zone further outwards, where radiation pressure equals or exceeds gas pressure, essentially creating a tipping point that drives the disk's behavior."}

The previous work assumed an unbounded three-dimensional diffusion region, whereas the present one considers a flat cylindrical disc bounded in both the radial and vertical directions.

Considering the values of the halo height H≳ 2kpc obtained by different authors, the present work suggests that the study of the effect of local sources on the CR anisotropy can be carried out without having much information on H and hence, using the much simpler three-dimentional unbounded solution. Finally, the present work discusses about the possibility of explaining the observed anisotropy below the knee by a single dominant source with properly chosen source parameters, and claims that the source may be an undetected old SNR with a characteristic age of ∼ 1.5× 10^5 yr located at a distance of ∼ 0.57 kpc from the Sun.

Furthermore, quantum gravity effects are expected to induce proton instability, indicating that the higher energy cutoff scale must be above 10^16GeV. Quasi-realistic heterotic string models provide the arena to explore how perturbative quantum gravity affects the particle physics phenomenology. An appealing explanation for the proton longevity is provided by the existence of an Abelian gauge symmetry that suppresses the proton decay mediating operators. Additionally, such a low-scale U(1) symmetry should: allow the suppression of the left-handed neutrino masses by a seesaw mechanism; allow fermion Yukawa couplings to the electroweak Higgs doublets; be anomaly free; be family universal. These requirements render the existence of such U(1) symmetries in quasi-realistic heterotic string models highly non-trivial. We demonstrate the existence of a U(1) symmetry that satisfies all of the above requirements in a class of left-right symmetric heterotic string models in the free fermionic formulation. The existence of the extra Z' in the energy range accessible to future experiments is motivated by the requirement of adequate suppression of proton decay mediation.

This allows sufficient separation of scales to observe a Navier-Stokes (NS) inertial range followed by a 2nd LANS inertial range. The analysis of the third-order structure function scaling supports the predicted l^3 scaling; it corresponds to a k^(-1) scaling of the energy spectrum. The energy spectrum itself shows a different scaling which goes as k^1. This latter spectrum is consistent with the absence of stretching in the sub-filter scales due to the Taylor frozen-in hypothesis employed as a closure in the derivation of LANS. These two scalings are conjectured to coexist in different spatial portions of the flow. The l^3 (E(k) k^(-1)) scaling is subdominant to k^1 in the energy spectrum, but the l^3 scaling is responsible for the direct energy cascade, as no cascade can result from motions with no internal degrees of freedom. We verify the prediction for the size of the LANS attractor resulting from this scaling. From this, we give a methodology either for arriving at grid-independent solutions for LANS, or for obtaining a formulation of a LES optimal in the context of the alpha models. The fully converged grid-independent LANS may not be the best approximation to a direct numerical simulation of the NS equations since the minimum error is a balance between truncation errors and the approximation error due to using LANS instead of the primitive equations.

We then use these couplings to determine the radion branching fractions and discuss some of the discovery potential of the LHC for the radion. We find that the gamma-gamma signal is enhanced over most of the range of the radion mass over the gamma-gamma signal of a SM Higgs, as long as the RS scale is sufficiently low. However, the signal significance depends strongly on free parameters that characterize the magnitude of bare brane-localized kinetic terms for the massless gauge fields. In the absence of such terms, the signal can be be enhanced over the traditional RS1 models (where all standard model fields are localized on the IR brane), but the signal can also be reduced compared to RS1 if the brane localized terms are sizeable.

The time-dependent currents and their averages over succesive pumping periods are computed from the Keldysh formalism for tight-binding models. The calculation considers a sudden application of the pumping potentials at t=0 which leads to transient features of the time-dependent and averaged currents during the first pumping cycles which turn out to be important in the high-frequency regime. We show that in the transient regime the efficiency of the system as a pump is rather poor because it mainly absorbs charge from both leads in order to fill the levels located below the bias window. Under a finite bias and a low-frequency pumping signal the charge transferred across the system depends on the number of levels located within the bias window. The internal charge dynamics and the role of energy sidebands are investigated. The so called satellite peaks of the averaged current are observed also in the transient regime.

That theory promised a 'general' and 'homogeneous' treatment of numerous questions arising in various 19th-century theoretical contexts, and it hinged on two theorems, stated independently by Jordan and Weierstrass, that would today be considered equivalent. It was, however, the perceived difference between those two theorems that sparked the 1874 controversy. Focusing on this quarrel allows us to explore the algebraic identity of the polynomial practices of the manipulations of forms in use before the advent of structural approaches to linear algebra. The latter approaches identified these practices with methods for the classification of similar matrices. We show that the prac- tices – Jordan's canonical reduction and Kronecker's invariant computation – reflect identities inseparable from the social context of the time. Moreover, these practices reveal not only tacit knowledge, local ways of thinking, but also – in light of a long history tracing back to the work of Lagrange, Laplace, Cau- chy, and Hermite – two internal philosophies regarding the significance of generality which are inseparable from two disciplinary ideals opposing algebra and arithmetic. By interrogating the cultural identities of such practices, this study aims at a deeper understanding of the history of linear algebra without focusing on issues related to the origins of theories or structures.

Deconvolution and correlation techniques are being employed with a significance down to 1/1000 th of a pixel. HeAr and ThAr lamps are usually used for calibration in low and high resolution spectroscopy, respectively. Unfortunately, the emitted lines typically cover only a small fraction of the spectrometer's spectral range. Furthermore, their exact position depends strongly on environmental conditions. A problem is the strong intensity variation between different (intensity ratios >300). In addition, the brightness of the lamps is insufficient to illuminate a spectrograph via an integrating sphere, which in turn is important to calibrate a long-slit spectrograph, as this is the only way to assure a uniform illumination of the spectrograph pupil.Laboratory precision laser spectroscopy has experienced a major advance with the development of optical frequency combs generated by pulsed femto-second lasers. These lasers emit a broad spectrum (several hundred nanometers in the visible and near infra-red) of equally-spaced 'comb' lines with almost uniform intensity (intensity ratios typically <10). Self-referencing of the laser establishes a precise ruler in frequency space that can be stabilized to the 10e-18 uncertainty level, reaching absolute frequency inaccuracies at the 10e-12 level per day when using the Global Positioning System's (GPS) time signal as the reference.

The dark energy is a field with slightly sub-gravitational couplings to matter, a logarithmic self-interaction potential with a scale tuned to ∼ 10^-3 eV, as is usual in quintessence models, and an effective mass m_ϕ influenced by the environmental energy density. Its forces may be suppressed just below the current bounds by the chameleon-like mimicry, whereby only outer layers of mass distributions, of thickness 1/m_ϕ, give off appreciable long range forces. After inflation and reheating, the field is relativistic, and attains a Planckian expectation value before Hubble friction freezes it. This can make gravity in space slightly stronger than on Earth. During the matter era, interactions with nonrelativistic matter dig a minimum close to the Planck scale. However, due to its sub-gravitational matter couplings the field will linger away from this minimum until the matter energy density dips below ∼ 10^-12 eV^4. Then it starts to roll to the minimum, driving a period of cosmic acceleration. Among the signatures of this scenario may be dark energy equation of state w-1, stronger gravity in dilute mediums, that may influence BBN and appear as an excess of dark matter, and sub-millimeter corrections to Newton's law, close to the present laboratory limits.

Born effective charges (BEC) calculated using the Berry phase expression are found to be anomalously large for the A-cations, indicating their chemical relevance to ferroelectric distortions.

However, in many situations, such as a star formed at the edge of a molecular cloud core, an offset power-law density distribution would be more appropriate. In this paper a few of the main issues of the formation and expansion of HII regions in such media are outlined and results are presented for the particular cases where the underlying power laws are 1/r^2 and 1/r^3. A simple criterion is developed for determining whether the initial photoionized region will be unbounded, which depends on the power-law exponent and the ratio of the equivalent Stroemgren radius produced by the star in a uniform medium to the stellar offset distance. In the expansion stage, the ionized volumes will eventually become unbounded unless pressure balance with the external medium is reached before the ionization front velocity becomes supersonic with respect to the ionized gas.
