A three component (labels 1, 2, 3) mixture of Fermions is considered where the components 1 and 2 interact and, for instance, form pairs whereas the component 3 is in the normal state. For cooling, the components 2 and 3 are coupled by an electromagnetic field. Since the quasiparticle distributions in the paired and in the normal states are different, the coupling leads to cooling of the normal state even when initially T_paired≥ T_normal (notation T_S≥ T_N). The cooling efficiency is given by the pairing energy and by the linewidth of the coupling field. No superfluidity is required: any type of pairing, or other phenomenon that produces a suitable spectral density, is sufficient. In principle, the paired state could be cooled as well but this requires T_N<T_S. The method has a conceptual analogy to cooling based on superconductor – normal metal (SN) tunneling junctions. Main differences arise from the exact momentum conservation in the case of the field-matter coupling vs. non-conservation of momentum in the solid state tunneling process. Moreover, the role of processes that relax the energy conservation requirement in the tunneling, e.g. thermal fluctuations of an external reservoir, is now played by the linewidth of the field. The proposed method should be experimentally feasible due to its close connection to RF-spectroscopy of ultracold gases which is already in use. "}

When such a highly ionized hot “super-bubble” falls along the sightline to a background quasar, it would be seen as a large void, with little or no absorption, in the Lyman alpha forest. We examine the spectra of 137 quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, to search for such voids, and find no clear evidence of their existence. The size distribution of voids in the range 5-70 Angstrom (corresponding to physical sizes of approximately 3-35 comoving Mpc/h) is consistent with the standard model for the Lyman alpha forest without additional hot bubbles. We adapt a physical model for HII bubble growth during cosmological reionization (Furlanetto, Zaldarriaga and Hernquist 2004), to describe the expected size-distribution of hot super-bubbles at redshift around z = 3. This model incorporates the conjoining of bubbles around individual neighboring galaxies. Using the non-detection of voids, we find that models in which the volume filling factor of hot bubbles exceeds approximately 20 percent at z=3 can be ruled out, primarily because they overproduce the number of large (40-50 Angstrom) voids. We conclude that any pre-heating mechanism that explains galaxy cluster observations must avoid heating the low-density gas in the proto-cluster regions, either by operating relatively recently (z<3) or by depositing entropy in the high-density regions.

We find that boxy galaxies originate from mergers with a progenitor mass ratio n < 2 and with a combined cold gas mass fraction F_ cold < 0.1. Our model accurately reproduces the observed fraction of boxy systems as a function of luminosity and halo mass, for both central galaxies and satellites. After correcting for the stellar mass dependence, the properties of the last major merger of early-type galaxies are independent of their halo mass. This provides theoretical support for the conjecture of Pasquali et al (2007) that the stellar mass of an early-type galaxy is the main parameter that governs its isophotal shape. We argue that the observed dichotomy of early-type galaxies has a natural explanation within hierarchical structure formation, and does not require AGN feedback. Rather, we argue that it owes to the fact that more massive systems (i) have more massive progenitors, (ii) assemble later, and (iii) have a larger fraction of early-type progenitors. Each of these three trends causes the cold gas mass fraction of the progenitors of more massive early-types to be lower, so that their last major merger was dryer. Finally, our model predicts that (i) less than 10 percent of all early-type galaxies form in major mergers that involve two early-type progenitors, (ii) more than 95 percent of all boxy early-type galaxies with M_* < 2 × 10^10 h^-1 are satellite galaxies, and (iii) about 70 percent of all low mass early-types do not form a supermassive black hole binary at their last major merger.

Both NGC 5044 and 4636 have extended 70 microns emission from cold dust exceeding that expected from stellar mass loss. The sputtering lifetime of this extended dust in the1keV interstellar gas,10^7 yrs, establishes the time when the dust first entered the hot gas. Evidently the extended dust originated in dusty disks or clouds, commonly observed in elliptical galaxy cores, that were disrupted, heated and buoyantly transported outward. The surviving central dust in NGC 5044 and 4636 has been disrupted into many small filaments. It is remarkable that the asymmetrically extended 8 micron emission in NGC 5044 is spatially coincident with Halpha+[NII] emission from warm gas. A calculation shows that dust-assisted cooling in buoyant hot gas moving out from the galactic core can cool within a few kpc in about10^7 yrs, explaining the optical line emission observed. The X-ray images of both galaxies are disturbed. All timescales for transient activity - restoration of equilibrium and buoyant transport in the hot gas, dynamics of surviving dust fragments, and dust sputtering - are consistent with a central release of feedback energy in both galaxies about 10^7 yrs ago.

The well-known “spiral arms” are clearly observed and they trail the rotating disk material. Weaker arms never before reported are also seen. The inter-arm space becomes brighter, but the structures become more neutral in color at longer wavelengths, which is not consistent with models that assume that they are due to the effects of a warped disk.

The disk colors are similar to those derived for Kuiper Belt objects, suggesting that the same processes responsible for their colors may be at work here. We argue that we are observing only the geometrically thick, optically thin envelope of the disk, while the optically thick disk responsible for the far-IR emission is undetected.

Using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, we traced these molecular transitions in the central region of Mrk231, where we found evidence of an extremely dense, compact molecular gas structure; however, our proposed models suggested that the observed CO emission arose from high-density gas associated with the central engine rather than a rotating disk, as typically seen in lower-luminosity systems. Our work aimed to shed light on the gas kinematics in ultra-luminous star-forming galaxies, which were key systems in the formation and evolution of galaxies through cosmic time; in addition, our results suggested that the dense gas reservoir in Mrk231 was limited, and that the cooling rate was not sufficient to meet the observed high star-formation rate. Therefore, the cooling budget may have been supplemented by other mechanisms, such as feedback from the active galactic nucleus; furthermore, a key outcome of our study was that strong nuclear heating may have been required in some ultra-luminous galaxies to offset the high cooling rate of their dense gas reservoirs and explain their ultraluminous infrared properties.

We find that the CO J=4-3 and J=6-5 transitions trace a different gas phase from that dominating the lower three CO transitions, with n(H_2)(1-3)x10^4 cm-3 and Tk(40-70) K. This phase is responsible for the luminous HCN emission, and contains most of the H2 gas mass of this galaxy. The total CO line cooling emanating from this dense phase is found similar to that of the [CII] line at 158 micron, suggesting a very different thermal balance to that seen in lower IR-luminosity galaxies, and one likely dominated by dense photon-dominated regions. Our dense 'sampling' of the CO rotational ladder and the HCN lines enables us to produce well-constrained Spectral Line Energy Distributions (SLEDs) for the dense molecular gas in Mrk231 and compare them to those of high redshift starbursts, many of which have SLEDs that may be affected by strong lensing. Finally, we use our local molecular line excitation template to assess the capabilities of future cm and mm/sub-mm arrays in detecting CO and HCN transitions in similar systems throughout the local and distant universe.

The propagated field is given in terms of an integral of a Fourier type, which cannot be evaluated even for simple models of the dispersive dielectric. The fact that the oscillators have a low number density (dilute medium) and have a narrow-band resonance allows us to simplify the integrand. In this case, the integral can be evaluated exactly, although it is not possible using this method to separate out the transient part of the propagated field known as optical precursors. We also use an asymptotic method (saddle-point method) to evaluate the integral. The contributions to the integral related to the saddle-points of the integrand give rise to the optical precursors. We obtain analytic expressions for the precursor fields and the domain over which the asymptotic method is valid. When combined to obtain the total transient field, we find that the agreement between the solutions obtained by the asymptotic and the exact methods is excellent.

Solving these equation we obtain decoherence and relaxation rates of the qubit, as well as the spectral density of the fluctuating qubit's parameters.

The source is not detected in the optical, at wavelengths shorter than the I-band. The diamond is seen in all the imaging bands observed. The ring-like structure in IRAS06468-0325 is clearly seen in the I, J, H, and Ks. It is not detected in the L'-band image. Infrared colours of the diamond are compatible with excess circumstellar emission and a young stellar nature.

K-band spectra of the diamond and of the ring are similar both in the slope of the continuum and in the presence of lines supporting the idea that the ring is reflected light from the diamond.

However, the available data seem to favour that the morphology of IRAS06468-0325 correspond to a young stellar multiple system in a transient stage where a binary co-exists with a circumbinary disc, similar to the case of GG Tau. In this case, the sharpness of the well-defined ring may be due to tidal truncation from dynamic interactions between components in a binary or multiple stellar system.

Many authors have therefore considered gene duplication as a driving force in shaping the topology of molecular networks. In particular it has been noted that growth via duplication would act as an implicit way of preferential attachment, and thereby provide the observed broad degree distributions of molecular networks.Results: We extend current models of gene duplication and rewiring by including directions and the fact that molecular networks are not a result of unidirectional growth. We introduce upstream sites and downstream shapes to quantify potential links during duplication and rewiring. We find that this in itself generates the observed scaling of transcription factors for genome sites in procaryotes. The dynamical model can generate a scale-free degree distribution, p(k)prop; 1/k^gamma;, with exponentgamma;=1 in the non-growing case, and withgamma;>1 when the network is growing.Conclusions: We find that duplication of genes followed by substantial recombination of upstream regions could generate main features of genetic regulatory networks. Our steady state degree distribution is however to broad to be consistent with data, thereby suggesting that selective pruning acts as a main additional constraint on duplicated genes. Our analysis shows that gene duplication can only be a main cause for the observed broad degree distributions, if there is also substantial recombinations between upstream regions of genes. "}

This is motivated in part by results of Hayden et al., which show that in large d x d–dimensional systems there exist random subspaces of dimension almost d^2, all of whose states have entropy of entanglement at least log d - O(1). It is also related to results due to Parthasarathy on the dimension of completely entangled subspaces, which have connections with the construction of unextendible product bases. Here we take as entanglement measure the Schmidt rank, and determine, for every pair of local dimensions dA and dB, and every r, the largest dimension of a subspace consisting only of entangled states of Schmidt rank r or larger. This exact answer is a significant improvement on the best bounds that can be obtained using random subspace techniques. We also determine the converse: the largest dimension of a subspace with an upper bound on the Schmidt rank. Finally, we discuss the question of subspaces containing only states with Schmidt equal to r. "}

In particular this is true if the foliation is given by a function. Along these lines a result due to Eells and Kuiper <cit.> classify manifolds having a real-valued function admitting exactly three non-degenerate singular points. In the present paper, we prove a generalization of the above mentioned results. To do this, we first describe the possible arrangements of pairs of singularities and the corresponding codimension one invariant sets, and then we give an elimination procedure for suitable center-saddle and some saddle-saddle configurations (of consecutive indices). In the second part, we investigate if other classical results, such as Haefliger and Novikov (Compact Leaf) theorems, proved for regular foliations, still hold true in presence of singularities. At this purpose, in the singular set, Sing() of the foliation , we consider weakly stable components, that we define as those components admitting a neighborhood where all leaves are compact. If Sing() admits only weakly stable components, given by smoothly embedded curves diffeomorphic to S^1, we are able to extend Haefliger's theorem.

We re-examine the constraints on this scenario from the presently available cosmological data and investigate the sensitivity expected from the Planck satellite. In the first case, we find that the sensitivity strongly depends on which piece of data is used. The SDSS Main sample data, combined with WMAP and other data, disfavors the scenario of three coupled neutrinos at about the 3.5σ confidence level, but also favors a high number of freely streaming neutrinos, with the best fit at 5.2. If the matter power spectrum is instead taken from the SDSS Large Red Galaxy sample, best fit point has 2.5 freely streaming neutrinos, but the scenario with three coupled neutrinos becomes allowed at 2σ. In contrast, Planck alone will exclude even a single self-coupled neutrino at the 4.2σ confidence level, and will determine the total radiation at CMB epoch to Δ N_ν^eff = ^+0.5_-0.3 (1σ errors). We investigate the robustness of this result with respect to the details of Planck's detector.

We find that, overall, the satellite population traces the dark matter rather well: its spatial distribution and kinematics may be approximated by an NFW profile with a mildly anisotropic velocity distribution. Their spatial distribution is also mildly anisotropic, with a well-defined “anti-Holmberg” effect that reflects the misalignment between the major axis and angular momentum of the host halo. The isolation criteria for our primaries picks not only galaxies in sparse environments, but also a number of primaries at the centre of ”fossil” groups. We find that the abundance and luminosity function of these unusual systems are in reasonable agreement with the few available observational constraints. We recover the expected L_hostσ_sat^3 relation for LCDM models for truly-isolated primaries. Less strict primary selection, however, leads to substantial modification of the scaling relation.

Nanothreads of excess silver cause distortions in the current flow that yield a linear and non-saturating transverse magnetoresistance (MR).

The longitudinal MR only occurs in the three-dimensional limit and thereby permits the determination of a characteristic length scale set by the spatial inhomogeneity. We find that this fundamental inhomogeneity length can be as large as ten microns. Systematic measurements of the diagonal and off-diagonal components of the resistivity tensor in various sample geometries show clear evidence of the distorted current paths posited in theoretical simulations. We use a random resistor network model to fit the linear MR, and expand it from two to three dimensions to depict current distortions in the third (thickness) dimension. When compared directly to experiments on Ag_2±δSe and Ag_2±δTe, in magnetic fields up to 55 T, the model identifies conductivity fluctuations due to macroscopic inhomogeneities as the underlying physical mechanism. It also accounts reasonably quantitatively for the various components of the resistivity tensor observed in the experiments. "}

We use the thermal conductivity of a fully ionized hydrogen plasma proposed by Spitzer and a saturated heat flux according to CowieMcKee in regions where the mean free path of the electrons is large compared to the temperature scaleheight. Significant structural and evolutionary differences occur between simulations with and without heat conduction. Dense clouds in pure dynamical models experience dynamical destruction by Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability. In static models heat conduction leads to evaporation of such clouds. Heat conduction acting on clouds in a gas stream smooths out steep temperature and density gradients at the edge of the cloud because the conduction timescale is shorter than the cooling timescale. This diminishes the velocity gradient between the streaming plasma and the cloud, so that the timescale for the onset of KH instabilities increases, and the surface of the cloud becomes less susceptible to KH instabilities. The stabilisation effect of heat conduction against KH instability is more pronounced for smaller and less massive clouds. As in the static case more realistic cloud conditions allow heat conduction to transfer hot material onto the cloud's surface and to mix the accreted gas deeper into the cloud. "}

The method is designed to eliminate the problems inherent in the rate-equation formalism to surface chemistry. Here we report the first use of this method in a chemical model of cold interstellar cloud cores that includes both gas-phase and surface chemistry. The surface chemical network consists of a small number of diffusive reactions that can produce molecular oxygen, water, carbon dioxide, formaldehyde, methanol and assorted radicals. METHOD: The simulation is started by running a gas-phase model including accretion onto grains but no surface chemistry or evaporation. The starting surface consists of either flat or rough olivine. We introduce the surface chemistry of the three species H, O and CO in an iterative manner using our stochastic technique. Under the conditions of the simulation, only atomic hydrogen can evaporate to a significant extent. Although it has little effect on other gas-phase species, the evaporation of atomic hydrogen changes its gas-phase abundance, which in turn changes the flux of atomic hydrogen onto grains. The effect on the surface chemistry is treated until convergence occurs. We neglect all non-thermal desorptive processes. RESULTS: We determine the mantle abundances of assorted molecules as a function of time through 2x10^5 yr. Our method also allows determination of the abundance of each molecule in specific monolayers. The mantle results can be compared with observations of water, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and methanol ices in the sources W33A and Elias 16. Other than a slight underproduction of mantle CO, our results are in very good agreement with observations. "}

At first sight, this looks like a remarkable achievement, but from a mathematical point of view, Guseinov's work is at best questionable and in some cases fundamentally flawed. One-range addition theorems are expansions in terms of functions that are complete and orthonormal in a given Hilbert space, but Guseinov replaced the complete and orthonormal functions by nonorthogonal Slater-type functions and rearranged the resulting expansions. This is a dangerous operation whose validity must be checked. It is shown that the one-center limit r' = 0 of Guseinov's rearranged Yukawa addition theorems as well as of several other addition theorems does not exist. Moreover, the Coulomb potential does not belong to any of the Hilbert spaces implicitly used by Guseinov. Accordingly, one-range addition theorems for the Coulomb potential diverge in the mean.

The method is formulated and tested on the two-dimensional interior Poisson and exterior Laplace problems, whose solutions and their normal derivatives are required to be continuous across the interface. A complete basis of homogeneous solutions for the interior and exterior regions, corresponding to all possible Dirichlet boundary values at the interface, are calculated in a preprocessing step. This basis is used to construct the influence matrix which serves to transform the coupled boundary conditions into conditions on the interior problem. Chebyshev approximations are used to represent both the interior solutions and the boundary values. A standard Chebyshev spectral method is used to calculate the interior solutions. The exterior harmonic solutions are calculated as the convolution of the free-space Green's function with a surface density; this surface density is itself the solution to an integral equation which has an analytic solution when the boundary values are given as a Chebyshev expansion. Properties of Chebyshev approximations insure that the basis of exterior harmonic functions represents the external near-boundary solutions uniformly. The method is tested by calculating the electrostatic potential resulting from charge distributions in a rectangle. The resulting influence matrix is well-conditioned and solutions converge exponentially as the resolution is increased. The generalization of this approach to three-dimensional problems is discussed, in particular the magnetohydrodynamic equations in a finite cylindrical domain surrounded by a vacuum. "}

The Green's tensor approach permits computation of the phase and amplitude dependence of the diffracted wave as a function of the groove geometry. It is shown that the field diffracted along the interface by the groove is equivalent to replacing the groove by an oscillating dipolar line source. An analytic expression is derived from the Green's function formalism, that reproduces well the asymptotic surface plasmon polariton (SPP) wave as well as the transient surface wave in the near-zone close to the groove. The agreement between this model and the full simulation is very good, showing that the transient 'near-zone' regime does not depend on the precise shape of the groove. Finally, it is shown that a composite diffractive evanescent wave model that includes the asymptotic SPP can describe the wavelength evolution in this transient near-zone. Such a semi-analytical model may be useful for the design and optimization of more elaborate photonic circuits whose behavior in large part will be controlled by surface waves. "}

We describe here RIPL, the Radio Interferometric PLanet search, a new program with the VLBA and the Green Bank 100 m telescope that will survey 29 low-mass, active stars over 3 years with sub-Jovian planet mass sensitivity at 1 AU. An upgrade of the VLBA bandwidth will increase astrometric accuracy by an order of magnitude. Ultimately, the colossal collecting area of the Square Kilometer Array could push astrometric accuracy to 1 microarcsecond, making detection and characterizaiton of Earth mass planets possible.RIPL and other future radio astrometric planet searches occupy a unique volume in planet discovery and characterization parameter space. The parameter space of astrometric searches gives greater sensitivity to planets at large radii than radial velocity searches. For the VLBA and the expanded VLBA, the targets of radio astrometric surveys are by necessity nearby, low-mass, active stars, which cannot be studied efficiently through the radial velocity method, coronagraphy, or optical interferometry. For the SKA, detection sensitivity will extend to solar-type stars. Planets discovered through radio astrometric methods will be suitable for characterization through extreme adaptive optics.The complementarity of radio astrometric techniques with other methods demonstrates that radio astrometry can play an important role in the roadmap for exoplanet discovery and characterization.

High-resolution and high signal-to-noise spectra have been obtained in the Be II spectral region near 3130 Åfor six ultra-Li-deficient stars with the Keck I telescope and its new uv-sensitive CCD on the upgraded HIRES. The spectrum synthesis technique has been used to determine Be abundances. All six stars are found to have Be deficiencies also. Two have measurable - but reduced - Be and four have only upper limits on Be. These results are consistent with the idea that these Li- and Be-deficient stars are analogous to blue stragglers. The stars have undergone mass transfer events (or mergers) which destroy or dilute both Li and Be. The findings cannot be matched by the models that predict that the deficiencies are due to extra-mixing in a subset of halo stars that were initially rapid rotators, with the possible exception of one star, G 139-8. Because the ultra-Li-deficient stars are also Be-deficient, they appear to be genuine outliers in population of halo stars used to determine the value of primordial Li; they no longer have the Li in their atmospheres that was produced in the Big Bang.

Our HRC-I observation resolved the historical Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULX), X3, near the nucleus into 2 sources, namely C12 and C13, for the first time.

From the astrometric registration of the X-ray image, C12 was at R.A.=03h:46m:48.43s, decl.=+68d05m47.45s, and was closer to the nucleus than C13. Thus we concluded that source was not an ULX and must instead be associated with the nucleus.

A non-cooperative game is proposed in which each user seeks to choose its transmit power (and possibly transmit symbol rate) as well as the constellation size in order to maximize its own utility while satisfying its delay quality-of-service (QoS) constraint. The utility function used here measures the number of reliable bits transmitted per joule of energy consumed, and is particularly suitable for energy-constrained networks. The best-response strategies and Nash equilibrium solution for the proposed game are derived. It is shown that in order to maximize its utility (in bits per joule), a user must choose the lowest constellation size that can accommodate the user's delay constraint. Using this framework, the tradeoffs among energy efficiency, delay, throughput and constellation size are also studied and quantified. The effect of trellis-coded modulation on energy efficiency is also discussed. "}

Entanglement is at the heart of quantum physics, both for its conceptual foundations and for applications in information processing and quantum communication. Remarkably, entanglement can be 'swapped': if one prepares two independent entangled pairs A1-A2 and B1-B2, a joint measurement on A1 and B1 (called a 'Bell-State Measurement', BSM) has the effect of projecting A2 and B2 onto an entangled state, although these two particles have never interacted or shared any common past[1,2]. Experiments using twin photons produced by spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) have already demonstrated entanglement swapping[3-6], but here we present its first realization using continuous wave (CW) sources, as originally proposed[2]. The challenge was to achieve sufficiently sharp synchronization of the photons in the BSM. Using narrow-band filters, the coherence time of the photons that undergo the BSM is significantly increased, exceeding the temporal resolution of the detectors. Hence pulsed sources can be replaced by CW sources, which do not require any synchronization[6,7], allowing for the first time the use of completely autonomous sources. Our experiment exploits recent progress in the time precision of photon detectors, in the efficiency of photon pair production by SPDC with waveguides in nonlinear crystals[8], and in the stability of narrow-band filters. This approach is independent of the form of entanglement; we employed time-bin entangled photons[9] at telecom wavelengths. Our setup is robust against thermal or mechanical fluctuations in optical fibres thanks to cm-long coherence lengths. "}

Our research had shown that simulations were used to evaluate the impact of these node characteristics on worm propagation, which would inform the development of more effective strategies for worm containment and prevention in networks; however, our work offered implications for designing more effective strategies for worm mitigation in networks.", "model": "llama 3.1", "human_text": "An encounter-based network is a frequently disconnected wireless ad-hoc network requiring nearby neighbors to store and forward data utilizing mobility and encounters over time. Using traditional approaches such as gateways or firewalls for deterring worm propagation in encounter-based networks is inappropriate. Because this type of network is highly dynamic and has no specific boundary, a distributed counter-worm mechanism is needed. We propose models for the worm interaction approach that relies upon automated beneficial worm generation to alleviate problems of worm propagation in such networks. We study and analyze the impact of key mobile node characteristics including node cooperation, immunization, on-off behavior on the worm propagations and interactions. We validate our proposed model using extensive simulations. We also find that, in addition to immunization, cooperation can reduce the level of worm infection. Furthermore, on-off behavior linearly impacts only timing aspect but not the overall infection. Using realistic mobile network measurements, we find that encounters are non-uniform, the trends are consistent with the model but the magnitudes are drastically different. Immunization seems to be the most effective in such scenarios. These findings provide insight that we hope would aid to develop counter-worm protocols in future encounter-based networks. "}

In a previous paper we showed that RPT successfully predicts the damping of acoustic oscillations; here we extend our calculation to the enhancement of power due to mode-coupling. We show that mode-coupling generates additional oscillations that are out of phase with those in the linear spectrum, leading to shifts in the scales of oscillation nodes defined with respect to a smooth spectrum. When Fourier transformed, these out of phase oscillations induce percent-level shifts in the acoustic peak of the two-point correlation function. We present predictions for these shifts as a function of redshift; these should be considered as a robust lower limit to the more realistic case that includes in addition redshift distortions and galaxy bias. We show that these nonlinear effects occur at very large scales, leading to a breakdown of linear theory at scales much larger than commonly thought. We discuss why virialized halo profiles are not responsible for these effects, which can be understood from basic physics of gravitational instability. Our results are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations, and can be used as a starting point for modeling BAO in future observations. To meet this end, we suggest a simple physically motivated model to correct for the shifts caused by mode-coupling. "}

In the related case of two-dimensional Type 0A strings, it has been argued that the conformal α'→∞limit leads to AdS_2 with a propagating fermion whose mass is set by the value of the RR flux. Here we provide evidence that in the high-energy limit, the natural ground state of noncritical M-theory similarly describes the AdS_2×S^1 spacetime, with a massless propagating fermion. We argue that the spacetime effective theory in this background is captured by a topological higher-spin extension of conformal Chern-Simons gravity in 2+1 dimensions, consistently coupled to a massless Dirac field. Intriguingly, the two-dimensional plane populated by the original nonrelativistic fermions is essentially the twistor space associated with the symmetry group of the AdS_2×S^1 spacetime; thus, at least in the high-energy limit, noncritical M-theory can be nonperturbatively described as a 'Fermi liquid on twistor space.'

A compressive wave is set up in a constant sub-Jeans density distribution of radius r = 1 pc. As the wave travels through the simulation grid, a shock-bounded spherical shell is formed. The inner shock of this shell reaches and bounces off the center, leaving behind a central core with an initially almost uniform density distribution, surrounded by an envelope consisting of the material in the shock-bounded shell, with a power-law density profile that at late times approaches a logarithmic slope of -2 even in non-collapsing cases. The resulting density structure resembles a quiescent core of radius < 0.1 pc, with a Bonnor-Ebert-like (BE-like) profile, although it has significant dynamical differences: it is initially non-self-gravitating and confined by the ram pressure of the infalling material, and consequently, growing continuously in mass and size. With the appropriate parameters, the core mass eventually reaches an effective Jeans mass, at which time the core begins to collapse. Thus, there is necessarily a time delay between the appearance of the core and the onset of its collapse, but this is not due to the dissipation of its internal turbulence as it is often believed. These results suggest that pre-stellar cores may approximate Bonnor-Ebert structures which are however of variable mass and may or may not experience gravitational collapse, in qualitative agreement with the large observed frequency of cores with BE-like profiles.

Using an SED radiative transfer model of starbursts covering the wavelength range UV – submm, we derive photometric redshifts from the optical-MIR SEDs of 18um-selected galaxies. From the best-fit SED models, we show that the IRC all-band photometry is capable of tracing the steep rise in flux at the blue side of the PAH 6.2um emission feature. This indicates that the IRC all-band photometry is useful to constrain the redshift of infrared galaxies, specifically for dusty galaxies with a less prominent 4000A break. Also, we find that the flux dip between the PAH 7.7 and 11.2um emission feature is recognizable in the observed SEDs of galaxies at z 1.

This pilot study suggests the possibility of detecting many interesting galaxy properties in the NEP-Deep and Wide surveys, such as a systematic difference in SEDs between high- and low-z ULIRGs, and a large variation of the PAH inter-band strength ratio in galaxies at high redshifts.

Here, we take advantage of the diagrammatic reformulation of alternating innocence in asynchronous games, in order to provide a tentative definition of innocence in non-alternating games.

A singularity is called malicious if the equivalence class [p_0] related to the singularity remains in close contact with all other equivalence classes, i.e., if p_0 ∈cl[p] for every p ∈ E.

Our main result is that, in the noncommutative regime, even the strongest singularities are probabilistically irrelevant. "}

It works in the frequency domain to remove strong systematic errors during the search process. Based on tests done on simulated data and real data, we confirmed that TRUFAS performs better or as well as other algorithms, including the Box Least-Squares (BLS) algorithm. We compared the computed ranks of all algorithms on the same datasets and applied a reliability test to quantify their detection capabilities. The TRUFAS algorithm obtained a high RMS improvement percentage compared to other algorithms, signifying its superior transit detection efficiency.  In conclusion, TRUFAS is a powerful tool for the large-scale transit search in the era of big data astronomy. The proposed algorithm overcomes computational limitations of traditional transit detection methods while being efficient and accurate. Furthermore, with its built-in frequency-based error correction and detection reliability assessment, TRUFAS can accelerate the discovery of new exoplanets. \n\n                  for this text I want you to change the tense of every sentence.

Methods: The procedure proposed for the detection of planetary transits in light curves works in two steps: 1) a continuous wavelet transformation of the detrended light curve with posterior selection of the optimum scale for transit detection, and 2) a period search in that selected wavelet transformation. The detrending of the light curves are based on Fourier filtering or a discrete wavelet transformation. TRUFAS requires the presence of at least 3 transit events in the data. Results: The proposed algorithm is shown to identify reliably and quickly the transits that had been included in a standard set of 999 light curves that simulate CoRoT data. Variations in the pre-processing of the light curves and in the selection of the scale of the wavelet transform have only little effect on TRUFAS' results. Conclusions: TRUFAS is a robust and quick transit detection algorithm, especially well suited for the analysis of very large volumes of data from space or ground-based experiments, with long enough durations for the target-planets to produce multiple transit events.

The nature of the compact object and the origin of the high-energy emission are unclear. One family of models invokes particle acceleration in shocks from the collision between the B-star wind and a relativistic pulsar wind, while another centers on a relativistic jet powered by accretion. Recent high-resolution radio observations showing a putative 'cometary tail' pointing away from the Be star near periastron have been cited as support for the pulsar-wind model. We wish here to carry out a quantitative assessment of these competing models for this extraordinary source. We apply a 3D SPH code for dynamical simulations of both the pulsar-wind-interaction and accretion-jet models. The former yields a description of the shape of the wind-wind interaction surface. The latter provides an estimation of the accretion rate. The results allow critical evaluation of how the two distinct models confront the data in various wavebands under a range of conditions. When one accounts for the 3D dynamical wind interaction under realistic constraints for the relative strength of the B-star and pulsar winds, the resulting form of the interaction front does not match the putative 'cometary tail' claimed from radio observations. On the other hand, dynamical simulations of the accretion-jet model indicate that the orbital phase variation of accretion power includes a secondary broad peak well away from periastron, thus providing a plausible way to explain the observed TeV gamma ray emission toward apastron. We conclude that the colliding-wind model is not clearly established for LS I +61 303, while the accretion-jet model can reproduce many key characteristics of the observed TeV gamma-ray emission. "}

However, a critical choice for their convergence and efficiency relied on iterative solvers, and the traditional approach was based on solving these problems. The main objective of this work had been to evaluate the performance of BLOPEX preconditioners in the context of the hypre and PETSc libraries, two widely used software packages for solving linear systems and eigenvalue problems; it was found that BLOPEX could significantly improve the convergence and efficiency of iterative solvers for a wide range of eigenvalue problems.

BLOPEX is available as a stand-alone serial library, as an external package to PETSc (“Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation”, a general purpose suite of tools for the scalable solution of partial differential equations and related problems developed by Argonne National Laboratory), and is also built into hypre (“High Performance Preconditioners”, scalable linear solvers package developed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory). The present BLOPEX release includes only one solver–the Locally Optimal Block Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (LOBPCG) method for symmetric eigenvalue problems. hypre provides users with advanced high-quality parallel preconditioners for linear systems, in particular, with domain decomposition and multigrid preconditioners. With BLOPEX, the same preconditioners can now be efficiently used for symmetric eigenvalue problems. PETSc facilitates the integration of independently developed application modules with strict attention to component interoperability, and makes BLOPEX extremely easy to compile and use with preconditioners that are available via PETSc. We present the LOBPCG algorithm in BLOPEX for hypre and PETSc. We demonstrate numerically the scalability of BLOPEX by testing it on a number of distributed and shared memory parallel systems, including a Beowulf system, SUN Fire 880, an AMD dual-core Opteron workstation, and IBM BlueGene/L supercomputer, using PETSc domain decomposition and hypre multigrid preconditioning. We test BLOPEX on a model problem, the standard 7-point finite-difference approximation of the 3-D Laplacian, with the problem size in the range 10^5-10^8. "}

The energy of the fundamental harmonic of the cyclotron resonance absorption line near the maximum of the X-ray flux from the source (luminosity range 5x10^37 - 2x10^38 erg/s) is11 keV. When the pulsar luminosity falls below5x10^37 erg/s, the energy of the fundamental harmonic is displaced sharply toward the high energies, up to16 keV. Under the assumption of a dipole magnetic field configuration, this change in cyclotron harmonic energy corresponds to a decrease in the height of the emitting region by2 km, while other spectral parameters, in particular, the cutoff energy, remain essentially constant. At a luminosity7x10^37 erg/s, four almost equidistant cyclotron line harmonics are clearly seen in the spectrum. This suggests that either the region where the emission originates is compact or the emergent spectrum from different (in height) segments of the accretion column is uniform.

A crucial parameter is the ratio P*= Pa/F0 of applied pressure P, acting on grains of diameter a, to maximum tensile contact force F0. At low P* the final structure depends on the level of velocity fluctuations at the early stages of cluster aggregation.

Our simulations show that 802.11 networks with random topologies operated with AODV routing can only achieve throughputs far below the upper bounds.

However, determining the optimal window for the 2MASS dipole was a non-trivial task. Our key idea was to use a Bayesian approach to estimate the optimal window; this method involved creating a model for the dipole signal and comparing it to observed data, which were analyzed from the WMAP and Planck missions. Furthermore, we used a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to sample the posterior distribution of the model parameters, which allowed us to estimate the optimal window on the basis of the evidence. We had found that the optimal window for the 2MASS dipole was between 50 and 80 degrees, which was consistent with previous studies; in addition, our model for the dipole signal allowed us to estimate the optimal window on the basis of the evidence. In conclusion, we presented a new approach for determining the optimal window for the 2MASS dipole, our results will assist in refining measurements of the cosmic microwave background spectrum and testing the standard model of cosmology however, our methodology was refined and our study was improved over time, and therefore we estimated that the optimal window was determined with greater accuracy.", "model": "llama 3.1", "human_text": "A comparison of the 2MASS flux dipole to the CMB dipole can serve as a method to constrain a combination of the cosmological parameter Omega_m and the luminosity bias of the 2MASS survey. For this constraint to be as tight as possible, it is necessary to maximize the correlation between the two dipoles. This can be achieved by optimizing the survey window through which the flux dipole is measured. Here we explicitly construct such a window for the 2MASS survey. The optimization in essence reduces to excluding from the calculation of the flux dipole galaxies brighter than some limiting magnitude K_min of the near-infrared K_s band. This exclusion mitigates nonlinear effects and shot noise from small scales, which decorrelate the 2MASS dipole from the CMB dipole. Under the assumption of negligible shot noise we find that the optimal value of K_min is about five. Inclusion of shot noise shifts the optimal K_min to larger values. We present an analytical formula for shot noise for the 2MASS flux dipole, to be used in follow-up work with 2MASS data.The misalignment angle between the two dipoles is a sensitive measure of their correlation: the higher the correlation, the smaller the expectation value of the angle. A minimum of the misalignment is thus a sign of the optimal gravity window. We model analytically the distribution function for the misalignment angle and show that the misalignment estimated by Maller et al. is consistent with the assumed underlying model (though it is greater than the expectation value).

We define the bimeromorphic category of geometric orbifolds. These interpolate between (compact Kähler) manifolds and such manifolds with logarithmic structure. These geometric orbifolds are considered from the point of view of their geometry, and thus equipped with the usual invariants of varieties: morphisms and bimeromorphic maps, differential forms, fundamental groups and universal covers, fields of definition and rational points. The most elementary properties, directly adapted from the case of varieties without orbifold structure, are established here. The arguments of [Ca01] can then be directly adapted to extend the main structure results to this orbifold category. We hope to come back to deeper aspects later. The motivation is that the natural frame for the theory of classification of compact Kähler (and complex projective) manifolds includes at least the category of orbifolds, as shown in [Ca01] by the fonctorial decomposition of special manifolds as tower of orbifolds with either κ_+=-∞ or κ=0, and also, seemingly, by the minimal model program, in which most proofs work only after the adjunction of a 'boundary'.Also, fibrations enjoy in the bimeromorphic category of geometric orbifolds extension properties not satisfied in the category of varieties without orbifold structure, permitting to express invariants of the total space from those of the generic fibre and of the base. For example, the natural sequence of fundamental groups is exact there; also the total space is special if so are the generic fibre and the base. This makes this category suitable to lift properties from orbifolds having either κ_+=-∞ or κ=0 to those which are special. "}

We first show how system-size stochastic resonance arises naturally in this framework, and then how the phenomenon of array-enhanced stochastic resonance can be further enhanced by letting the diffusion coefficient depend on the field. A yet less trivial generalization is exemplified by a stylized version of the FitzHugh-Nagumo system, a paradigm of the activator-inhibitor class. After discussing for this system the second aspect enumerated above, we derive from it -through an adiabatic-like elimination of the inhibitor field- an effective scalar model that includes a nonlocal contribution.

Using this simulator, the performance of carbon nanoribbon (CNR) MOSFETs is examined in the ballistic limit. The impact of quantum effects on device performance of CNR MOSFETs is also studied. We found that 2D semi-infinite graphene contacts provide metal-induced-gap-states (MIGS) in the CNR channel. These states would provide quantum tunneling in the short channel device and cause Fermi level pining. These effects cause device performance degradation both on the ON-state and the OFF-state. Pure 1D devices (infinite contacts), however, show no MIGS. Quantum tunneling effects are still playing an important role in the device characteristics. Conduction due to band-to-band tunneling is accurately captured in our simulations. It is important in these devices, and found to dominate the off-state current. Based on our simulations, both a 1.4nm wide and a 1.8nm wide CNR with channel length of 12.5nm can outperform ultra scaled Si devices in terms of drive current capabilities and electrostatic control. Although subthreshold slopes in the forward-bias conduction are better than in Si transistors, tunneling currents are important and prevent the achievement of the theoretical limit of 60mV/dec. "}

It is written in a factorized form, with an off-shell form factor multiplying an on-shell part given by an effective range expansion up to the fourth power in momentum. The parameters of this expansion have been taken from an existing recent relativistic Faddeev equation solution for the η NN system corresponding to different η-N scattering amplitudes. Calculations have also been done using few body equations within a finite rank approximation (FRA) to generate T_η d →η d. The p-d final state interaction is included in the spirit of the Watson-Migdal prescription by multiplying the matrix element by the inverse of the Jost function. The η-d interaction is found to be dominant in the region of small invariant η -d mass, M_η d. The p-d interaction enhances the cross section in the whole region of M_η d, but is larger for large M_η d.

The inter-nuclear potential energy term converges if zero point vibrations are incorporated and this method can replace the Ewald sum method. Core energy contributions to the ordering energy are stored exclusively in superlattice lines. The effect of electron-phonon interactions on ordering energy is of the same order of magnitude as ordering energy near transition temperatures and cannot be ignored. Ising model and variants are incorrect in explaining alloy phase transitions as they ignore the role of electron-phonon interactions without justification. A theoretical formalism that incorporates the Debye-Waller Factor component of electron-phonon interactions in electronic structure calculations already exists and must be adopted when modeling temperature dependent phenomena. It is suggested that DWF correction will account substantially for the discrepancy between experimental and theoretical ordering energy in Ni3V. Thermal vibrations alter magnetic ordering energy at finite temperatures. The role of electron-phonon interactions in alloy and magnetic phase transitions cannot be ignored and must be incorporated in all models. This will also ensure consistency with x-ray and electron diffraction (alloy transitions) and neutron diffraction (magnetic transitions) results. An isotope effect is predicted for (magnetic) phase transitions if the transition temperature is below Debye temperature. Recent observations of an isotope effect in magnetic phase transitions confirm our above conclusions and imply that the role of electron-phonon interactions must be incorporated in all theories and models of magnetism to avoid contradictions.

We show that some Standard Model inspired parametrizations can be senseless or inadequate if they go beyond the minimal Gronau and London assumptions: the single weak phase α just in the Δ I=3/2 amplitudes, the isospin relations and experimental data. Beside those analyses, we extract α through the use of several adequate parametrizations, showing that there is no relevant discrepancy between frequentist and bayesian results.

For a linear data model, a number of known and novel reconstruction schemes, which differ in terms of the underlying signal prior, data likelihood, and numerical inverse extra-regularization schemes are derived and classified. The Bayesian methodology presented in this paper tries to unify and extend the following methods: Wiener-filtering, Tikhonov regularization, Ridge regression, Maximum Entropy, and inverse regularization techniques. The inverse techniques considered here are the asymptotic regularization, the Jacobi, Steepest Descent, Newton-Raphson, Landweber-Fridman, and both linear and non-linear Krylov methods based on Fletcher-Reeves, Polak-Ribiere, and Hestenes-Stiefel Conjugate Gradients. The structures of the up-to-date highest-performing algorithms are presented, based on an operator scheme, which permits one to exploit the power of fast Fourier transforms. Using such an implementation of the generalized Wiener-filter in the novel ARGO-software package, the different numerical schemes are benchmarked with 1-, 2-, and 3-dimensional problems including structured white and Poissonian noise, data windowing and blurring effects. A novel numerical Krylov scheme is shown to be superior in terms of performance and fidelity. These fast inverse methods ultimately will enable the application of sampling techniques to explore complex joint posterior distributions. We outline how the space of the dark-matter density field, the peculiar velocity field, and the power spectrum can jointly be investigated by a Gibbs-sampling process. Such a method can be applied for the redshift distortions correction of the observed galaxies and for time-reversal reconstructions of the initial density field. "}

However, our motivation for this research stems from the increasing interest in the behavior of materials at the nanoscale, where their properties differed significantly from their bulk counterparts. Specifically, the confinement of materials in one dimension led to unique properties, such as enhanced surface effects and unusual electronic behaviour, which had been observed by many researchers previously; however, the structural and mechanical response of confined materials remained poorly understood, limiting their potential applications. The problem that we were trying to tackle was to identify the underlying mechanisms that governed the structural and mechanical properties of confined materials in quasi one-dimensional strips. To do so, we presented a theoretical framework based on a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and analytical modelling; whereas our approach described the interplay between confinement-induced anisotropy and the deformation response of materials under mechanical loading, which had been successfully modelled by some researchers before. Our findings suggested that the confinement-induced anisotropy of confined solids led to anisotropic mechanical responses, characterised by different yield strengths and fracture patterns along different directions, in addition to the formation of helical structures, which were thought to be an exotic structural phase; however, our results also showed that these mechanisms were not yet fully understood, and therefore further research was needed. Furthermore, our results shed light on the fundamentals of structural and mechanical behaviour of confined solids in quasi one-dimensional strips, which could have implications in the design of novel nanoscale materials with tailored properties, and hence their potential applications were vast; whereas, in conclusion, our study provided new insights into the behaviour of confined materials.", "model": "llama 3.1", "human_text": "We show using computer simulations and mean field theory that a system of particles in two dimensions, when confined laterally by a pair of parallel hard walls within a quasi one dimensional channel, possesses several anomalous structural and mechanical properties not observed in the bulk. Depending on the density ρ and the distance between the walls L_y, the system shows structural characteristics analogous to a weakly modulated liquid, a strongly modulated smectic, a triangular solid or a buckled phase. At fixed ρ, a change in L_y leads to many reentrant discontinuous transitions involving changes in the number of layers parallel to the confining walls depending crucially on the commensurability of inter-layer spacing with L_y. The solid shows resistance to elongation but not to shear. When strained beyond the elastic limit it fails undergoing plastic deformation but surprisingly, as the strain is reversed, the material recovers completely and returns to its original undeformed state. We obtain the phase diagram from mean field theory and finite size simulations and discuss the effect of fluctuations. "}

An useful byproduct of this proof is that any exactly conserved quantum charge, not associated with a long-range classical field, must be defined maximum modulo N, bounded by the the ratio of the Planck to the unit charge masses squared. For example, a continuous global U(1) `baryon number' symmetry, must be explicitly broken by gravity, at least down to a Z_N subgroup, with N bounded by the ratio of the Planck to baryon masses squared. The same constraint applies to any discrete gauge symmetry, as well as to other quantum-mechanically detectable black hole charges that are associated with the massive quantum hair of the black hole.

The most important example is the detection problem of selecting between the data being consistent with instrument noise alone, or instrument noise and a gravitational wave signal. The analysis of data from ground based gravitational wave detectors is mostly conducted using classical statistics, and methods such as the Neyman-Pearson criteria are used for model selection. Future space based detectors, such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), are expected to produced rich data streams containing the signals from many millions of sources. Determining the number of sources that are resolvable, and the most appropriate description of each source poses a challenging model selection problem that may best be addressed in a Bayesian framework. An important class of LISA sources are the millions of low-mass binary systems within our own galaxy, tens of thousands of which will be detectable. Not only are the number of sources unknown, but so are the number of parameters required to model the waveforms. For example, a significant subset of the resolvable galactic binaries will exhibit orbital frequency evolution, while a smaller number will have measurable eccentricity. In the Bayesian approach to model selection one needs to compute the Bayes factor between competing models. Here we explore various methods for computing Bayes factors in the context of determining which galactic binaries have measurable frequency evolution. The methods explored include a Reverse Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) algorithm, Savage-Dickie density ratios, the Schwarz-Bayes Information Criterion (BIC), and the Laplace approximation to the model evidence.

In the first one, we derive the polymer quantum mechanics starting from the ordinary Schroedinger theory and show that the polymer description arises as an appropriate limit. In the second part we consider the continuum limit of this theory, namely, the reverse process in which one starts from the discrete theory and tries to recover back the ordinary Schroedinger quantum mechanics.

HS 0805+3822 shows grazing eclipses and has a likely orbital period of 3.2169(2) h. Time-resolved optical spectroscopy of the new CVs (with the exception of HS 0805+3822) is also presented. Radial velocity studies provided an orbital period of 3.55 h for HS 1813+6122, which allowed us to identify the observed photometric signal at 3.39 h as a negative superhump wave. The spectroscopic behaviour clearly identifies these new CVs as new SW Sextantis stars. These new additions increase the number of known SW Sex stars to 35. Almost 40 per cent of the total SW Sex population do not show eclipses, invalidating the requirement of eclipses as a defining characteristic of the class and the models based on a high orbital inclination geometry alone. On the other hand, the predominance of orbital periods in the narrow 3-4.5 h range is becoming more pronounced. In fact, almost half the CVs which populate the 3-4.5 h period interval are definite members of the class. These statistics are confirmed by our results from the Hamburg Quasar Survey CVs. Remarkably, 54 per cent of the Hamburg nova-like variables have been identified as SW Sex stars with orbital periods in the 3-4.5 h range. The observation of this pile-up of systems close to the upper boundary of the period gap is difficult to reconcile with the standard theory of CV evolution, as the SW Sex stars are believed to have the highest mass transfer rates among CVs. Finally, we review the full range of common properties that the SW Sex stars exhibit. "}

The transport of the particles is viewed as an effective diffusion along one-dimensional lattices with periodically distributed weak links. When an unbiased random walker passes the weak link it can be destroyed (“burned”) with probability p, providing a bias in the motion of the molecular motor. A new theoretical approach that allows one to calculate exactly all dynamic properties of motor proteins, such as velocity and dispersion, at general conditions is presented. It is found that dispersion is a decreasing function of the concentration of bridges, while the dependence of dispersion on the burning probability is more complex. Our calculations also show a gap in dispersion for very low concentrations of weak links which indicates a dynamic phase transition between unbiased and biased diffusion regimes. Theoretical findings are supported by Monte Carlo computer simulations. "}

In particular, it obtains the classical modular polynomials Φ_ℓ of prime level ℓ in time O (ℓ^3 log^4 ℓloglogℓ). Besides treating modular polynomials for Γ^0 (ℓ), which are an important ingredient in many algorithms dealing with isogenies of elliptic curves, the algorithm is easily adapted to more general situations.

The resulting stationary distribution was unique and had a specific structure, despite the fact that it was difficult to analyze. In addition, we showed that the potential function existed and was unique. Nonetheless, this process has received considerable interest in fields such as statistical physics and stochastic modeling, but the stationary distribution proved difficult to analyze until our results provided insight into its structure.

This process is dual to the zero-range process (ZRP) in the sense that, while for the ZRP the rate of transfer of a particle only depends on the occupation of the departure site, it only depends on the occupation of the arrival site for the target process. More precisely, duality associates to a given ZRP a unique target process, and vice-versa. If the dynamics is symmetric, i.e., in the absence of a bias, both processes have the same stationary-state product measure. In this work we focus our interest on the situation where the latter measure exhibits a continuous condensation transition at some finite critical density ρ_c, irrespective of the dimensionality. The novelty comes from the case of asymmetric dynamics, where the target process has a nontrivial fluctuating stationary state, whose characteristics depend on the dimensionality. In one dimension, the system remains homogeneous at any finite density. An alternating scenario however prevails in the high-density regime: typical configurations consist of long alternating sequences of highly occupied and less occupied sites. The local density of the latter is equal to ρ_c and their occupation distribution is critical. In dimension two and above, the asymmetric target process exhibits a phase transition at a threshold density ρ_0 much larger than ρ_c. The system is homogeneous at any density below ρ_0, whereas for higher densities it exhibits an extended condensate elongated along the direction of the mean current, on top of a critical background with density ρ_c.

At the time of observation, AR 8375 was young, AR 0330 mature, and AR 9575 decaying. The vertical velocity indicates that the elements of MMF pairs with polarity opposite to that of the sunspot support a downflow of around 50-100 m s^-1. The average Doppler shift difference between negative and positive elements of an MMF pair is about 150 m s^-1 in AR 8375, 100 m s^-1 in AR 0330, and 20 m s^-1 in AR 9575. These observational results are in agreement with the model that MMF pairs are part of a U-loop emanating from the sunspot's magnetic canopy. According to this model the downflow is caused by the Evershed flow returning below the solar surface. For AR 8375, the horizontal velocity of MMFs ranges from 0.1 km s^-1 to 0.7 km s^-1, and on average, the velocity of an MMF pair decreases significantly (from 0.6 km s^-1 to 0.35 km s^-1) with increasing distance from the MMF's birth place. This result suggests that the change in MMF flow speed does not reflect the radial structure of the moat flow, but rather is intrinsic to the evolution of the MMF pairs. This result is also in agreement with the U-loop model of MMF pairs. We also find that properties of MMF pairs, most strikingly the lifetime, depend on the evolution stages of the parent sunspot. The mean lifetimes of MMF pairs in ARs 9575 and 0330 are 0.7 hours and 1.6 hours, respectively, which is considerably shorter than the 4 hours lifetime previously found for AR 8375. "}

The gamma-ray, X-ray and UV/optical emission all showed a peak75s after the trigger, although the optical and X-ray afterglow components also appear early on - before, or during, the main peak. Spectral evolution was seen throughout the burst, with the prompt emission showing a clear positive correlation between brightness and hardness. The Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of the prompt emission, stretching from 1eV up to 1MeV, is very flat, with a peak in the flux density at1keV. The optical-to-X-ray spectra at this time are better fitted by a broken, rather than single, power-law, similar to previous results for X-ray flares. The SED shows spectral hardening as the afterglow evolves with time. This behaviour might be a symptom of self-Comptonisation, although circumstellar densities similar to those found in the cores of molecular clouds would be required. The afterglow also decays too slowly to be accounted for by the standard models.

On the same basis, the usual classification of the extremals of a variational problem into normal and abnormal ones is also rationalized, showing the existence of a purely kinematical algorithm assigning to each admissible curve a corresponding abnormality index, defined in terms of a suitable linear map. The whole machinery is then applied to constrained variational calculus.

Such a low M_max, due to a kaon condensation in the stellar core, implies collapse of a too massive deleptonized protoneutron star into a black hole. This would naturally explain the lack of a neutron star in the SN1987A remnant. On the other hand, recent evaluation of mass of PSR J0751+1807 gives M_max > 2M_sun. This contradicts the original Bethe-Brown model, but can be reconciled within scenarios proposed in the present Letter. We consider two types of dense matter models with high-density softening, due to a transition from a non-strange N-phase of matter to a strangeness carrying phase S: kaon condensation and deconfinement of quarks. Two scenarios of neutron star formation in stellar core collapse are considered. In the first scenario, realized in sufficiently hot and dense supernova cores, nucleation of an S-phase is sufficiently rapid so as to form an S-phase core, and implying M_max = M^S_max =1.5M_sun. In the second scenario, nucleation of the S-phase at neutron star birth is too slow to materialize, and the star becomes cold without forming an S-phase core. Then, stellar mass can increase via accretion, until central density ρ_crit is reached, and the S phase forms. This N branch of neutron stars ends at M=M_crit. We select several models of N-phase satifying the necessary condition M^N_max > 2M_sun and combine them with models of kaon condensation and quark deconfinement. For kaon condensation, we get M_crit =M^S_max =1.5M_sun, which is ruled out by PSR J0751+1807. On the contrary, for the EOSs with quark deconfinement we get M_crit =M^N_max > 2M_sun, which reconciles SN1987A and PSR J0751+1807. "}

The increase in the QPO frequency accompanies a spectral transition of the source from its island to its banana states. The banana-states' Fourier-resolved spectra are well fitted by a single blackbody component with kT ∼ 2-3 keV depending on the source position in the color – color diagram and the Fourier frequency, thus indicating that this spectral component is responsible for the source variability on these timescales. This result is in approximate agreement with similar behavior exhibited by the Z sources, suggesting that, as in that case, the boundary layer – the likely source of the thermal component – is supported by radiation pressure. Furthermore, it is found that the iron line at ∼6.6 keV, clearly present in the averaged spectra, not apparent within the limitations of our measurements in the frequency-resolved spectra irrespective of the frequency range. This would indicate that this spectral component exhibits little variability on time scales comprising the interval 10^-2-10^2 seconds. In the island state the single blackbody model proved inadequate, particularly notable in our lowest frequency band (0.008-0.8 Hz). An absorbed powerlaw or an additive blackbody plus hard powerlaw model was required to obtain a satisfactory fit. Statistics do not allow unambiguous discrimination between these possible scenarios.

In many studies, this interaction has been computed with the ansatz that the actual interface configuration for the pair is given by the linear superposition of the interface deformations around the single particles. Here we assess the validity of this approach and compute the leading term of the effective interaction for large interparticle separation beyond this so-called superposition approximation. As an application, we consider the experimentally relevant case of interface deformations owing to the electrostatic field emanating from charged colloidal particles. In mechanical isolation, i.e., if the net force acting on the total system consisting of the particles plus the interface vanishes, the superposition approximation is actually invalid. The effective capillary interaction is governed by contributions beyond this approximation and turns out to be attractive. For sufficiently small surface charges on the colloids, such that linearization is strictly valid, and at asymptotically large separations, the effective interaction does not overcome the direct electrostatic repulsion between the colloidal particles.

We use Monte Carlo simulations up to a length of 256 to map out the phase diagram in the plane of parameters and determine the order of the associated phase transitions. We discuss the connections to semi-flexible polymers and other polymer models. Importantly, we demonstrate that for a range of energy parameters two phase transitions occur on lowering the temperature, the second being a transition from the globule state to the crystal state. We argue from our data that this globule-to-crystal transition is continuous in two dimensions in accord with field-theory arguments concerning Hamiltonian walks, but is first order in three dimensions.

In the framework of the flux rope catastrophe model for CMEs, the energy may be abruptly released either by an ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) catastrophe, which belongs to a global magnetic topological instability of the system, or by a fast magnetic reconnection across preexisting or rapidly-developing electric current sheets. Both ways of magnetic energy release are thought to be important to CME dynamics. To disentangle their contributions, we construct a flux rope catastrophe model in the corona and solar wind and compare different cases in which we either prohibit or allow magnetic reconnection to take place across rapidly-growing current sheets during the eruption. It is demonstrated that CMEs, even fast ones, can be produced taking the ideal MHD catastrophe as the only process of magnetic energy release. Nevertheless, the eruptive speed can be significantly enhanced after magnetic reconnection sets in. In addition, a smooth transition from slow to fast eruptions is observed when increasing the strength of the background magnetic field, simply because in a stronger field there is more free magnetic energy at the catastrophic point available to be released during an eruption. This suggests that fast and slow CMEs may have an identical driving mechanism. "}

Furthermore, quantum gravity effects are expected to induce proton instability, indicating that the higher energy cutoff scale must be above 10^16GeV. Quasi-realistic heterotic string models provide the arena to explore how perturbative quantum gravity affects the particle physics phenomenology. An appealing explanation for the proton longevity is provided by the existence of an Abelian gauge symmetry that suppresses the proton decay mediating operators.

These requirements render the existence of such U(1) symmetries in quasi-realistic heterotic string models highly non-trivial. We demonstrate the existence of a U(1) symmetry that satisfies all of the above requirements in a class of left-right symmetric heterotic string models in the free fermionic formulation.

After an appropriate transformation of the scale factor, this system can be further simplified to an object with constant mass moving in an effective potential field. In this framework, the Λ cold dark matter model as the current standard model of cosmology corresponds to a harmonic oscillator. We further generalize this formalism to take into account the bulk viscosity and other cases. The Hamiltonian can be quantized straightforwardly, but this is different from the approach of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in quantum cosmology. "}

Furthermore, we demonstrated that the inclusion of U significantly improved the accuracy of energy predictions by taking into account the electron correlation effects; in fact, it consistently gave a lower energy for the high-spin state than the DFT approach. Additionally, we found that the DFT+U approach provided a reliable method for such simulations; indeed, our findings revealed the importance of including electron correlation effects in simulating spin-state energetics of heme. We were able to take advantage of these findings to pave the way for more accurate simulations of heme and other systems with strong electron correlation effects. However, we also found that the inclusion of U significantly improved the accuracy of energy predictions by taking into account the electron correlation effects; in fact, it consistently gave a lower energy for the high-spin state than the DFT approach was shown to be a reliable method for such simulations, and our findings revealed the importance of including electron correlation effects in simulating spin-state energetics of heme,  which were previously unknown.", "model": "llama 3.1", "human_text": "We investigate the DFT+U approach as a viable solution to describe the low-lying states of ligated and unligated iron heme complexes. Besides their central role in organometallic chemistry, these compounds represent a paradigmatic case where LDA, GGA, and common hybrid functionals fail to reproduce the experimental magnetic splittings. In particular, the imidazole pentacoordinated heme is incorrectly described as a triplet by all usual DFT flavors. In this study we show that a U parameter close to 4 eV leads to spin transitions and molecular geometries in quantitative agreement with experiments, and that DFT+U represents an appealing tool in the description of iron porphyrin complexes, at a much reduced cost compared to correlated quantum-chemistry methods. The possibility of obtaining the U parameter from first-principles is explored through a self-consistent linear-response formulation. We find that this approach, which proved to be successful in other iron systems, produces in this case some overestimation with respect to the optimal values of U. "}

The chemical evolution models for Draco and Ursa Minor, which are able to reproduce several observational features of these two galaxies, such as the several abundance ratios, take up-to-date nucleosynthesis into account for intermediate-mass stars and supernovae of both types, as well as the effect of these objects on the energetics of the systems. For both galaxies, the model that best fits the data contains an intense continuous galactic wind, occurring at a rate proportional to the star formation rate. Models with a wind rate assumed to be proportional only to the supernova rate also reproduce the observed SMD, but do not match the gas mass, whereas the models with no galactic winds fail to reproduce the observed SMDs. In the case of Ursa Minor, the same model as in previous works reproduces the observed distribution very well with no need to modify the main parameters of the model. The model for Draco, on the other hand, is slightly modified. The observed SMD requires a model with a lower supernova type Ia thermalization efficiency (η_SNeIa = 0.5 instead of η_SNeIa = 1.0) in order to delay the galactic wind, whereas all the other parameters are kept the same.

Contrasting our current understanding of the evolution of KBOs and asteroids suggests that additional observational constraints, such as the identification of more dynamical families of KBOs (like the 2003 EL61 family), would provide additional information on the relative roles of collisional grinding and dynamical ejection in the Kuiper Belt. The uncertainties also motivate calculations that combine collisional and dynamical evolution, a `unified' calculation that should give us a better picture of KBO formation and evolution. "}

The IHV-index for a geomagnetic element is mechanically derived from hourly values as the sum of the unsigned differences between adjacent hours over a seven-hour interval centered on local midnight. The index is derived separately for stations in both hemispheres within six longitude sectors using only local night hours. It is intended as a long-term index. Available data allows derivation of the index back well into the 19th century. On a time scale of a 27-day Bartels rotation, IHV averages for stations with corrected geomagnetic latitude less than 55 degrees are strongly correlated with midlatitude range indices. Assuming a constant calibration of the aa-index we find that observed yearly values of aa before the year 1957 are 2.9 nT too small compared to values calculated from IHV using the regression constants based on 1980-2004. We interpret this discrepancy as an indication that the calibration of the aa index is in error before 1957. There is no such problem with the ap index. Rotation averages of IHV are also strongly correlated with solar wind parameters (BV^2). On a time scale of a year combining the IHV-index and the recently-developed Inter-Diurnal Variability (IDV) index (giving B) allows determination of solar wind speed, V, from 1890-present. Over the120-year series, the yearly mean solar wind speed varied from a low of 303 km/s in 1902 to a high value of 545 km/s in 2003. The calculated yearly values of the product BV using B and V separately derived from IDV and IHV agree quantitatively with (completely independent) BV derived from the amplitude of the diurnal variation of the H component in the polar caps since 1926 and sporadically beyond.

The spectra from the clouds are inconsistent with shock or “shock + precursor” ionization models, but they are consistent with photoionization by the quasar nucleus. The best-fit photoionization model requires a low-metallicity (12+log(O/H) < 8.7) two-phase medium, consisting of a matter-bounded diffuse component with a unity filling-factor (N1 , T15000 K), in which are embedded small, dense clouds (N400 , T10^4 K).

This allows sufficient separation of scales to observe a Navier-Stokes (NS) inertial range followed by a 2nd LANS inertial range. The analysis of the third-order structure function scaling supports the predicted l^3 scaling; it corresponds to a k^(-1) scaling of the energy spectrum. The energy spectrum itself shows a different scaling which goes as k^1. This latter spectrum is consistent with the absence of stretching in the sub-filter scales due to the Taylor frozen-in hypothesis employed as a closure in the derivation of LANS. These two scalings are conjectured to coexist in different spatial portions of the flow. The l^3 (E(k) k^(-1)) scaling is subdominant to k^1 in the energy spectrum, but the l^3 scaling is responsible for the direct energy cascade, as no cascade can result from motions with no internal degrees of freedom. We verify the prediction for the size of the LANS attractor resulting from this scaling. From this, we give a methodology either for arriving at grid-independent solutions for LANS, or for obtaining a formulation of a LES optimal in the context of the alpha models. The fully converged grid-independent LANS may not be the best approximation to a direct numerical simulation of the NS equations since the minimum error is a balance between truncation errors and the approximation error due to using LANS instead of the primitive equations. Furthermore, the small-scale behavior of LANS contributes to a reduction of flux at constant energy, leading to a shallower energy spectrum for large alpha. These small-scale features, do not preclude LANS to reproduce correctly the intermittency properties of high Re flow. "}

The correction is based on radio recombination line measurements of H+ and 4-He+, together with simple core-halo source models. We use these models to establish criteria that allow us to identify sources that can be accurately corrected for ionization and those that cannot. We argue that this effect cannot be very large for most of the sources in our observational sample.

Moreover, we observed that the presence of magnetic fields had a profound effect on the dynamics of dust grains within these regions; this, however, was not surprising given the critical role that turbulence plays in shaping the evolution of planetary systems.\n\n# We will continue to investigate the effects of magnetic turbulence on planetesimal formation in future studies.", "model": "llama 3.1", "human_text": "The first challenge in the formation of both terrestrial planets and the cores of gas giants is the retention of grains in protoplanetary disks. In most regions of these disks, gas attains sub-Keplerian speeds as a consequence of a negative pressure gradient. Hydrodynamic drag leads to orbital decay and depletion of the solid material in the disk, with characteristic timescales as short as only a few hundred years for meter-sized objects at 1 AU. In this paper, we suggest a particle retention mechanism which promotes the accumulation of grains and the formation of planetesimals near the water sublimation front or “snow line.” This model is based on the assumption that, in the regions most interesting for planet formation, the viscous evolution of the disk is due to turbulence driven by the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) in the surface layers of the disk. The depth to which MRI effectively generates turbulence is a strong function of the grain size and abundance. A sharp increase in the grain-to-gas density ratio across the snow line reduces the column depth of the active layer. As the disk evolves towards a quasi-steady-state, this change in the active layer creates a local maximum in radial distribution of the gas surface density and pressure, causing the gas to rotate at super-Keplerian speed and halting the inward migration of grains. This senario presents a robust process for grain retention which may aid in the formation of proto-gas-giant cores preferentially near the snow line. "}

{"machine_text": "In this work, we explore the capacity of a spiking neural network (SNN) with layered associative architecture to encode information using different neuronal firing patterns. Specifically, we investigate the effects of sparsity and density of neuronal activity on the network's ability to learn and retrieve patterns of input. Our motivation for this research comes from recent findings suggesting that biological neural networks, like the brain, use sparse coding to represent complex information effectively. However, sparse coding requires a large number of neurons to represent a given input, which may be costly in terms of metabolic resources.

Future high-resolution millimetre arrays, such as the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), will thus produce valuable input for the ongoing controversy on the thermal structure and the dynamics of this layer. Synthetic brightness temperature maps are calculated on basis of three-dimensional radiation (magneto-)hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. While the millimetre continuum at 0.3mm originates mainly from the upper photosphere, the longer wavelengths considered here map the low and middle chromosphere. The effective formation height increases generally with wavelength and also from disk-centre towards the solar limb. The average intensity contribution functions are usually rather broad and in some cases they are even double-peaked as there are contributions from hot shock waves and cool post-shock regions in the model chromosphere. Taking into account the deviations from ionisation equilibrium for hydrogen gives a less strong variation of the electron density and with it of the optical depth. The result is a narrower formation height range. The average brightness temperature increases with wavelength and towards the limb. The relative contrast depends on wavelength in the same way as the average intensity but decreases towards the limb. The dependence of the brightness temperature distribution on wavelength and disk-position can be explained with the differences in formation height and the variation of temperature fluctuations with height in the model atmospheres.

Despite these challenges, we were able to extract reliable SPSN measures, which allowed us to accurately estimate the dephasing time of our system. Our findings have important implications for the development of future quantum dot-based technologies, as they provide insights into the fundamental physics of quantum dot dephasing.

The study of the dephasing rate is expected to contribute to the understanding of the many-body nature of such systems. Closed quantum dots are of special interest in this respect, due to theoretical predictions suggesting a possible transition temperature below which the dephasing rate vanishes. This prediction has attracted much attention, since closed quantum dots are prime candidates for storage units in quantum computers, and thus their phase coherence properties are of great importance. However, an effective method for measuring the dephasing rate within a closed quantum dot is still lacking. Here we study two-level systems and show that the Fano factor has a sharp peak as a function of the chemical potential, the location of which can be simply related to the dephasing rate. We thus suggest to use the properties of the Fano factor peak in the super-Poissonian regime as a probe for the dephasing rate. "}

On the gauge theory side, expressions for perturbative amplitudes at strong coupling were previously proposed only for specific helicities of external particles – the maximally helicity violating or MHV amplitudes. These follow from the exponential ansatz of Bern, Dixon and Smirnov for MHV amplitudes in N=4 SYM. In this paper we examine the amplitudes dependence on helicities and particle-types of external states. We consider the prefactor of string amplitudes and give arguments suggesting that the prefactor at strong coupling should be the same as the Yang-Mills tree-level amplitude for the same process. This implies that scattering amplitudes in N=4 SYM simplify dramatically in the strong coupling limit. It follows from our proposal that in this limit all (MHV and non-MHV) n-point amplitudes are given by the (known) tree-level Yang-Mills result times the helicity-independent (and particle-type-independent) universal exponential.

Despite the fact that metals produced by “self-enrichment” in WR atmospheres exceed the initial – host galaxy – metallicity, by orders of magnitude, a particularly strong dependence of the mass-loss rate on the initial metallicity is found for WR stars at sub-solar metallicities (1/10 – 1/100 solar). This provides a significant boost to the collapsar model for GRBs, as it may present a viable mechanism to prevent the loss of angular momentum by stellar winds at low metallicity, whilst strong Galactic WR winds may inhibit GRBs occurring at solar metallicities. Furthermore, we discuss recently reported quasi-sinusoidal modulations in the radio lightcurves of SNe 2001ig and 2003bg.

The transmitters cooperate by first exchanging messages over an orthogonal transmitter cooperation channel, then encoding jointly with dirty paper coding. The receivers cooperate by using Wyner-Ziv compress-and-forward over an analogous orthogonal receiver cooperation channel. To account for the cost of cooperation, the allocation of network power and bandwidth among the data and cooperation channels is studied. It is shown that transmitter cooperation outperforms receiver cooperation and improves capacity over non-cooperative transmission under most operating conditions when the cooperation channel is strong.

Here we calculate the photon scattering rate profile for a single ultraviolet source. After taking into account previously neglected natural broadening of the resonance line, we find that photons approach the resonance frequency and experience most scatterings at a significantly smaller distance from the source than naively expected r=(dnu/nu_0)(c/H), where dnu=nu-nu_0 is the initial frequency offset, and the discrepancy increases as the initial frequency offset decreases. As a consequence, the scattering rate P(r) drops much faster with increasing distance than the previously assumed 1/r^2 profile. Near the source (r<1Mpc comoving), the scattering rate of photons that redshift into the Ly_alpha resonance converges to P(r) ∝r^-7/3. The scattering rate of Ly_alpha photons produced by splitting of photons that redshift into a higher resonance (Ly_gamma, Ly_delta, etc.) is only weakly affected by the radiative transfer, while the sum of scattering rates of Ly_alpha photons produced from all higher resonances also converges to P(r) ∝r^-7/3 near the source. At 15<z<35, on scales of0.01-20Mpc/h (comoving), the total scattering rate of Ly_alpha photons from all Lyman resonances is found to be higher by a factor of1+0.3[(1+z)/20]^2/3 than obtained without full radiative transfer.

The smooth halo component in M31 has a profile that can be fit with a Hernquist model of immense scale radius55 kpc, almost a factor of 4 larger than theoretical predictions. Alternatively a power-law with exponent -1.91 +/- 0.11 can be fit to the profile. The total luminosity of this structure is similar to that of the halo of the Milky Way.

{"machine_text": "We present an expansion for self-interacting random walks, which extends the existing formalism in several ways. The motivation for this research has been an increased interest in modeling complex systems, where the interaction between agents is crucial. In particular, we focus on random walks with a long-range interaction, where the probability of moving to a given site depends on the coordinates of all particles in the system, following a power-law distance dependence. While these models have been widely studied in the past, our expansion provides a new tool for computing the moments of the distribution, which can be of crucial importance in many applications.Our expansion is based on the generalization of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula, which allows us to take into account the higher-order contributions to the evolution of the system.

As such, the achievable dynamic range with our algorithm surpasses the current practical limit of N-body codes by orders of magnitude. This is particularly significant in studies of reionization, where the dynamic range is the principal limiting factor. We test our halo-finding and HII bubble-finding algorithms independently against N-body simulations with radiative transfer and obtain excellent agreement. We compute the size distributions of ionized and neutral regions in our maps. We find even larger ionized bubbles than do purely analytic models at the same volume-weighted mean hydrogen neutral fraction. We also generate maps and power spectra of 21-cm brightness temperature fluctuations, which for the first time include corrections due to gas bulk velocities. We find that velocities widen the tails of the temperature distributions and increase small-scale power, though these effects quickly diminish as reionization progresses. We also include some preliminary results from a simulation run with the largest dynamic range to date: a 250 Mpc box that resolves halos with masses M >2.2 x10^8 M_sun. We show that accurately modeling the late stages of reionization requires such large scales.

Such a singularity can cause an anisotropic variation in the coupling strength, which may partially explain the so-called nodal-antinodal dichotomy in the cuprates.

Alon, Benjamini, Lubetzky and Sodin studied non-backtracking random walks on regular graphs, and showed that their mixing rate may be up to twice as fast as that of the simple random walk. As an application, they showed that the maximal number of visits to a vertex, made by a non-backtracking random walk of length n on a high-girth n-vertex regular expander, is typically (1+o(1))log n/loglog n, as in the case of the balls and bins experiment. They further asked whether one can establish the precise distribution of the visits such a walk makes.In this work, we answer the above question by combining a generalized form of Brun's sieve with some extensions of the ideas in Alon et al. Let N_t denote the number of vertices visited precisely t times by a non-backtracking random walk of length n on a regular n-vertex expander of fixed degree and girth g. We prove that if g=ω(1), then for any fixed t, N_t/n is typically 1/et!+o(1). Furthermore, if g=Ω(loglog n), then N_t/n is typically 1+o(1)/et! uniformly on all t ≤ (1-o(1))log n/loglog n and 0 for all t ≥ (1+o(1))log n/loglog n. In particular, we obtain the above result on the typical maximal number of visits to a single vertex, with an improved threshold window. The essence of the proof lies in showing that variables counting the number of visits to a set of sufficiently distant vertices are asymptotically independent Poisson variables. "}

Special attention needs to be devoted to the coupling to massless gauge fields (photon, gluon), since it is well known that loop effects may be important for these fields.

We then use these couplings to determine the radion branching fractions and discuss some of the discovery potential of the LHC for the radion. We find that the gamma-gamma signal is enhanced over most of the range of the radion mass over the gamma-gamma signal of a SM Higgs, as long as the RS scale is sufficiently low. However, the signal significance depends strongly on free parameters that characterize the magnitude of bare brane-localized kinetic terms for the massless gauge fields. In the absence of such terms, the signal can be be enhanced over the traditional RS1 models (where all standard model fields are localized on the IR brane), but the signal can also be reduced compared to RS1 if the brane localized terms are sizeable.

We correlate the median radio flux densities against a range of other sample properties, including median values for redshift, [OIII] luminosity, emission line ratios, and the strength of the 4000A break. We detect a strong trend for sources that are actively undergoing star-formation to have excess radio emission beyond the10^28 ergs/s/Hz level found for sources without any discernible star-formation. Furthermore, this additional radio emission correlates well with the strength of the 4000A break in the optical spectrum, and may be used to assess the age of the star-forming component. We examine two subsamples, one containing the systems with emission line ratios most like star-forming systems, and one with the sources that have characteristic AGN ratios. This division also separates the mechanism responsible for the radio emission (star-formation vs. AGN). For both cases we find a strong, almost identical, correlation between [OIII] and radio luminosity, with the AGN sample extending toward lower, and the star-formation sample toward higher luminosities. A clearer separation between the two subsamples is seen as function of the central velocity dispersion of the host galaxy. For systems with similar redshifts and velocity dispersions, the star-formation subsample is brighter than the AGN in the radio by an order of magnitude. This underlines the notion that the radio emission in star-forming systems can dominate the emission associated with the AGN. "}

Non-LTE model calculations are carried out to study the influence of the He/H abundance ratio on the emergent radiation of He-strong stars and on their Teff determination. We find that the effective temperatures, surface gravities and bolometric absolute magnitudes of He-weak stars estimated with the BCD system and the integrated flux method are in good agreement between each other, and they also agree with previous determinations based on several different methods. The mean discrepancy between the visual absolute magnitudes derived using the Hipparcos parallaxes and the BCD values is on average 0.3 mag for He-weak stars, while it is 0.5 mag for He-strong stars. For He-strong stars, we note that the BCD calibration, based on stars in the solar environment, leads to overestimated values of Teff. By means of model atmosphere calculations with enhanced He/H abundance ratios we show that larger He/H ratios produce smaller BD which naturally explains the Teff overestimation. We take advantage of these calculations to introduce a method to estimate the He/H abundance ratio in He-strong stars. The BD of HD 37479 suggests that the Teff of this star remains fairly constant as the star spectrum undergoes changes in the intensity of H and He absorption lines.

The habitable zone is determined by the limits of biological productivity on the planetary surface. Models with different ratios of land / ocean coverage are investigated.

Right- or left-invariant symmetry fields of the reduced field define vortex manifolds for such flows.Consider now a mechanical system, whose configuration space is a Lie group and whose Lagrangian is invariant to left translations on that group, and assume that the mass geometry of the system may change under the action of internal control forces.

In recent work, Ochiai, et al., have shown that such collaborative beamforming can achieve a statistically nice beampattern with a narrow main lobe and low sidelobes. However, the process of collaboration introduces significant delay, since all collaborating nodes need access to the same information. In this paper, a technique that significantly reduces the collaboration overhead is proposed. It consists of two phases. In the first phase, nodes transmit locally in a random access fashion. Collisions, when they occur, are viewed as linear mixtures of the collided packets. In the second phase, a set of cooperating nodes acts as a distributed antenna system and beamform the received analog waveform to one or more faraway destinations. This step requires multiplication of the received analog waveform by a complex number, which is independently computed by each cooperating node, and which enables separation of the collided packets based on their final destination. The scheme requires that each node has global knowledge of the network coordinates. The proposed scheme can achieve high throughput, which in certain cases exceeds one. "}

That is why PKMs attract more and more researchers and companies, because they are claimed to offer several advantages over their serial counterparts, like high structural rigidity and high dynamic capacities. Indeed, the parallel kinematic arrangement of the links provides higher stiffness and lower moving masses that reduce inertia effects. Thus, PKMs have better dynamic performances.

The simple approximation is equivalent to an extended patch model, a simple metapopulation model with patches colonized by prey, patches colonized by predators and empty patches. This approximation is capable of describing the limited available space for species occupancy. The pair approximation is moreover able to describe two types of coexistence of prey and predators: one where population densities are constant in time and another displaying self-sustained time-oscillations of the population densities.

However, previously, we had found that this motion was primarily caused by the Local Void acting as a gravitational repeller. Furthermore, using data from various surveys and simulations, we re-determined that the Local Void is indeed responsible for our peculiar motion, confirming previous studies but now providing a more robust measurement of the dipole anisotropy and its relationship to the Local Void.

The three components are clearly separated because they arise on distinct spatial scales and are fortuitously almost orthogonal in their influences. The nearest, which is distinguished by a velocity discontinuity at7 Mpc, arises from the evacuation of the Local Void. We lie in the Local Sheet that bounds the void. Random motions within the Local Sheet are small. Our Galaxy participates in the bulk motion of the Local Sheet away from the Local Void. The component of our motion on an intermediate scale is attributed to the Virgo Cluster and its surroundings, 17 Mpc away. The third and largest component is an attraction on scales larger than 3000 km/s and centered near the direction of the Centaurus Cluster. The amplitudes of the three components are 259, 185, and 455 km/s, respectively, adding collectively to 631 km/s in the reference frame of the Local Sheet. Taking the nearby influences into account causes the residual attributed to large scales to align with observed concentrations of distant galaxies and reduces somewhat the amplitude of motion attributed to their pull. On small scales, in addition to the motion of our Local Sheet away from the Local Void, the nearest adjacent filament, the Leo Spur, is seen to be moving in a direction that will lead to convergence with our filament. Finally, a good distance to an isolated galaxy within the Local Void reveals that this dwarf system has a motion of at least 230 km/s away from the void center. Given the velocities expected from gravitational instability theory in the standard cosmological paradigm, the distance to the center of the Local Void must be at least 23 Mpc from our position.

Measuring the local concentration of such a protein with a spatially-varying distribution allows the measurement of position within the system. In order for these systems to work effectively, position determination must be robust to noise. Here, we calculate fundamental limits to the precision of position determination by concentration gradients due to unavoidable biochemical noise perturbing the gradients. We focus on gradient proteins with first order reaction kinetics. Systems of this type have been experimentally characterised in both developmental and cell biology settings. For a single gradient we show that, through time-averaging, great precision can potentially be achieved even with very low protein copy numbers. As a second example, we investigate the ability of a system with oppositely directed gradients to find its centre. With this mechanism, positional precision close to the centre improves more slowly with increasing averaging time, and so longer averaging times or higher copy numbers are required for high precision. For both single and double gradients, we demonstrate the existence of optimal length scales for the gradients, where precision is maximized, as well as analyzing how precision depends on the size of the concentration measuring apparatus. Our results provide fundamental constraints on the positional precision supplied by concentration gradients in various contexts, including both in developmental biology and also within a single cell.

The observational simplicity of our approach, and the direct measurements of the black hole predictor quantity, i.e. the Sersic index, for both elliptical galaxies and the bulges of disc galaxies makes it straightforward to estimate accurate black hole masses in early- and late-type galaxies alike.

Thus, the intrinsic features of such machinery are not accessible directly from (known) network properties. Rather, what one can see are the global patterns of its use and, thus, a global view of the power and organization of the underlying grammar. Taking a look into more practical issues, the paper examines how to build a net from the projection of syntactic relations. Recall that, as opposed to adult grammars, early-child language has not a well-defined concept of structure. To overcome such difficulty, we develop a set of systematic criteria assuming constituency hierarchy and a grammar based on lexico-thematic relations. At the end, what we obtain is a well defined corpora annotation that enables us i) to perform statistics on the size of structures and ii) to build a network from syntactic relations over which we can perform the standard measures of complexity. We also provide a detailed example. "}

Dark matter was believed to comprise a significant portion of the universe's total mass, yet it was entirely invisible due to its lack of interaction with light; our analysis confirmed this assumption. To address this limitation, we introduced the concept of emergent supersymmetry, which arose due to the collective behavior of particles in a given system, rather than from a specific underlying theory; furthermore, this approach enabled us to explore the interactions between dark matter and other particles, such as neutralinos, which may be responsible for its creation and stability. Our methodology involved the use of computer simulation and statistical analysis to model the behavior of particles at the microscopic level; in addition, we examined different scenarios and parameter spaces that influenced the mass and coupling values of the neutralino and gauge boson, and their respective interactions with dark matter. The emergent supersymmetry approach led to a significant enhancement in the neutralino dark matter abundance, making it an appealing candidate for the elusive material, whereas our results had already hinted at this possibility; however, the study findings highlighted the importance of incorporating emergent supersymmetry concepts in future research to provide a better understanding of dark matter in the universe.", "model": "llama 3.1", "human_text": "We investigated the viability of neutralino dark matter in the gauge mediation from emergent supersymmetry proposal. In this proposal, supersymmetry is broken at Planck scale and consequently, the gravitino is superheavy and completely decouples from the low energy theory. Squarks and sleptons obtain their soft masses dominantly through gauge mediation with other mechanisms highly suppressed. The lightest supersymmetric partner, in contrast to traditional gauge mediation, is a neutralino which is also a dark matter candidate. By explicit calculation of the low energy spectra, the parameter space was constrained using the WMAP observed relic density of dark matter, LEP2 Higgs mass bounds, collider bounds on supersymmetric partners and exotic B-meson decays. We found that the model has intriguing hybrid features such as a nearly gauge-mediated spectrum (the exception being the superheavy gravitino) but with a dominant mSUGRA-like bino-stau coannihilation channel and at large tanβ, A-resonance-like annihilation.

A culminating path is a path of Z^2 that starts from (0,0), consists of steps (1,a) and (1,-b), stays above the x-axis and ends at the highest ordinate it ever reaches. These paths were first encountered in bioinformatics, in the analysis of similarity search algorithms. They are also related to certain models of Lorentzian gravity in theoretical physics. We first show that the language on a two letter alphabet that naturally encodes culminating paths is not context-free. Then, we focus on the enumeration of culminating paths. A step by step approach, combined with the kernel method, provides a closed form expression for the generating fucntion of culminating paths ending at a (generic) height k. In the case a=b, we derive from this expression the asymptotic behaviour of the number of culminating paths of length n. When a>b, we obtain the asymptotic behaviour by a simpler argument. When a<b, we only determine the exponential growth of the number of culminating paths. Finally, we study the uniform random generation of culminating paths via various methods. The rejection approach, coupled with a symmetry argument, gives an algorithm that is linear when a>= b, with no precomputation stage nor non-linear storage required. The choice of the best algorithm is not as clear when a<b. An elementary recursive approach yields a linear algorithm after a precomputation stage involving O(n^3) arithmetic operations, but we also present some alternatives that may be more efficient in practise.

In addition, our network architecture was designed to take advantage of the unique properties of ferrofluids, specifically their ability to change their magnetic properties in response to an external magnetic field, which would allow us to create a neural network that could store and recall patterns; The input signals were applied via a magnetic field, and the output signals were read by measuring the changes in ferrofluid's magnetic properties, which we had found to be efficient.", "model": "llama 3.1", "human_text": "We analyse an associative memory based on a ferrofluid, consisting of a system of magnetic nano-particles suspended in a carrier fluid of variable viscosity subject to patterns of magnetic fields from an array of input and output magnetic pads. The association relies on forming patterns in the ferrofluid during a trainingdphase, in which the magnetic dipoles are free to move and rotate to minimize the total energy of the system. Once equilibrated in energy for a given input-output magnetic field pattern-pair the particles are fully or partially immobilized by cooling the carrier liquid. Thus produced particle distributions control the memory states, which are read out magnetically using spin-valve sensors incorporated in the output pads. The actual memory consists of spin distributions that is dynamic in nature, realized only in response to the input patterns that the system has been trained for. Two training algorithms for storing multiple patterns are investigated. Using Monte Carlo simulations of the physical system we demonstrate that the device is capable of storing and recalling two sets of images, each with an accuracy approaching 100"}

It sheds new light on the age old problem by thinking of the traditional algorithms as working with images. Inspiration is drawn from an analogous situation that is found in machine and human vision. Image processing techniques are used to assist in the spatial indexing of the data. A fixed grid approach is used and bins with too many records are sub-divided hierarchically. Search queries are pre-computed for bins that do not contain any data records. This has the effect of dividing the search space up into non rectangular regions which are based on the spatial properties of the data. The bucketing quad tree can be considered as an image with a resolution of two by two for each layer. The results show that this method performs better than the quad tree if there are more divisions per layer. This confirms our suspicions that the algorithm works better if it gets to look at the data with higher resolution images. An elegant class structure is developed where the implementation of concrete spatial indexes for a particular data type merely relies on rendering the data onto an image. "}

The proposed protocol had been designed to provide efficient and reliable QoS routing services; however, its implementation had faced several challenges, including the need to adapt to changing network conditions, prioritize traffic based on user-defined service requirements, and optimize network resource utilization. Our research had aimed to address these challenges by adopting a formal academic and scientific writing voice; presenting our methodology and key ideas in a clear and concise manner, and providing experimental evaluations that demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach.", "model": "llama 3.1", "human_text": "We present a formal model to represent and solve the unicast/multicast routing problem in networks with Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. To attain this, first we translate the network adapting it to a weighted graph (unicast) or and-or graph (multicast), where the weight on a connector corresponds to the multidimensional cost of sending a packet on the related network link: each component of the weights vector represents a different QoS metric value (e.g. bandwidth, cost, delay, packet loss). The second step consists in writing this graph as a program in Soft Constraint Logic Programming (SCLP): the engine of this framework is then able to find the best paths/trees by optimizing their costs and solving the constraints imposed on them (e.g. delay < 40msec), thus finding a solution to QoS routing problems. Moreover, c-semiring structures are a convenient tool to model QoS metrics. At last, we provide an implementation of the framework over scale-free networks and we suggest how the performance can be improved. "}

Theoretical models of galactic chemical evolution make contrasting predictions about the time evolution of metallicity gradients.

We analyze O/H and S/H abundances in planetary nebulae, Hii regions, and young stars, together with known [Fe/H] abundances in the old stellar population of M33. With a theoretical model, we follow the time evolution of gas (diffuse and condensed in clouds), stars, and chemical abundances in the disk of M33, assuming that the galaxy is accreting gas from an external reservoir. Our model is able to reproduce the available observational constraints on the distribution of gas and stars in M33 and to predict the time evolution of several chemical abundances. In particular, we find that a model characterized by a continuous infall of gas on the disk, at a rate of Ṁ_ inf≈ 1 M_⊙ yr^-1, almost constant with time, can also account for the relatively high rate of star formation and for the shallow chemical gradients. Supported by a large sample of high resolution observations for this nearby galaxy, we conclude that the metallicity in the disk of M33 has increased with time at all radii, with a continuous flattening of the gradient over the last ∼ 8 Gyr.

Finally, string theory predicted the presence of specific patterns in the CMB that could have arisen from the so-called \"brane inflation\", which had been considered before. We simulated CMB maps with these predictions and compared them with the latest Planck data that was released in 2018; our results suggest that the presence of extra dimensions would have affected the overall CMB power spectrum, while cosmic strings could have left imprints in the CMB temperature and polarization maps; however, we found that brane inflation could have left detectable signatures in the CMB temperature and polarization maps in the form of specific patterns; in addition, our analysis also revealed that these signatures could be used to test string theory predictions. We will now conclude by saying that our study demonstrates that CMB experiments can provide a powerful tool for testing string theory predictions; nonetheless, we must emphasize that this is still a developing area of research; thus, further work is needed to fully understand the implications of our findings.", "model": "llama 3.1", "human_text": "Future detection/non-detection of tensor modes from inflation in CMB observations presents a unique way to test certain features of string theory. Current limit on the ratio of tensor to scalar perturbations, r=T/S, is r < 0.3, future detection may take place for r > 10^-2-10^-3. At present all known string theory inflation models predict tensor modes well below the level of detection. Therefore a possible experimental discovery of tensor modes may present a challenge to string cosmology.The strongest bound on r in string inflation follows from the observation that in most of the models based on the KKLT construction, the value of the Hubble constant H during inflation must be smaller than the gravitino mass. For the gravitino mass in the usual range, m_3/2 < O(1) TeV, this leads to an extremely strong bound r < 10^-24. A discovery of tensor perturbations with r > 10^-3 would imply that the gravitinos in this class of models are superheavy, m_3/2 > 10^13 GeV. This would have important implications for particle phenomenology based on string theory. "}

However, our main goal was to construct two-sided bounds for the Green function using refined estimates for potentials of signed measures. In addition, we had been motivated by the fact that the Green function is a fundamental quantity in the study of stochastic processes, and understanding its properties is central in harmonizing various areas of mathematical analysis. Nevertheless, the α-stable process was a well-known stochastic process in signal processing, finance, and physics, and developing optimal bounds for its Green function had the potential to shed new light on its statistical and spatial properties. Furthermore, our methodology involved delicate analysis of positive and negative potentials of suitable measures and careful control of the constants arising in the estimates; we were constructing two-sided bounds for the Green function using refined estimates for potentials of signed measures. In contrast, these bounds provided a more precise estimate of the behavior of the Green function close to the boundary and revealed important new asymptotic regimes; however, our work was a significant contribution to the study of α-stable processes and had the potential to impact a wide range of fields where these processes arise.", "model": "llama 3.1", "human_text": "The purpose of this paper is to find optimal estimates for the Green function of a half-space of the relativistic α-stable process with parameter m onspace. This process has an infinitesimal generator of the form mI-(m^2/αI-Δ)^α/2, where 0<α<2, m>0, and reduces to the isotropic α-stable process for m=0. Its potential theory for open bounded sets has been well developed throughout the recent years however almost nothing was known about the behaviour of the process on unbounded sets. The present paper is intended to fill this gap and we provide two-sided sharp estimates for the Green function for a half-space. As a byproduct we obtain some improvements of the estimates known for bounded sets specially for balls. The advantage of these estimates is a clarification of the relationship between the diameter of the ball and the parameter m of the process.The main result states that the Green function is comparable with the Green function for the Brownian motion if the points are away from the boundary of a half-space and their distance is greater than one. On the other hand for the remaining points the Green function is somehow related the Green function for the isotropic α-stable process. For example, for d≥3, it is comparable with the Green function for the isotropic α-stable process, provided that the points are close enough. "}

In the current work the optical properties have been studied by diffuse reflection spectroscopy in the UV-Vis region and the band gap of the Co doped compositions has been found to decrease with Co addition. Reflections minima are observed at the energies characteristic of Co+2 d-d (tethrahedral symmetry) crystal field transitions, further establishing the presence of Co in substitutional sites.

However, the problem that this work attempted to solve was not yet well understood at the time, being the role that galactic winds play in shaping the properties of high-redshift galaxies; which still remained unclear. We had used our methodology involving a combination of deep imaging and spectroscopy of high-redshift galaxies, coupled with detailed modeling of their properties and the outflows that they host. Furthermore, we had examined the relationships between outflow properties and galaxy properties, in addition to constraining the properties of the outflows, including their kinematics, mass, and energy; which were all being calculated prior to our examination.

We find that the outflows tend to escape to low density regions, and hardly affect the dense filaments visible in HI absorption. As a result, the strength of HI absorption near galaxies is not reduced by galactic winds, but even slightly increases. We also find that a lack of HI absorption for lines of sight (LOS) close to galaxies, as found by Adelberger et al., can be created by hot gas around the galaxies induced by accretion shock heating. In contrast to HI, metal absorption systems are sensitive to the presence of winds. The models without feedback can produce the strong CIV and OVI absorption lines in LOS within 50 kpc from galaxies, while strong SN feedback is capable of creating strong CIV and OVI lines out to about twice that distance. We also analyze the mean transmissivity of HI, CIV, and OVI within 1 h^-1 Mpc from star-forming galaxies. The probability distribution of the transmissivity of HI is independent of the strength of SN feedback, but strong feedback produces LOS with lower transmissivity of metal lines. Additionally, strong feedback can produce strong OVI lines even in cases where HI absorption is weak. We conclude that OVI is probably the best tracer for galactic winds at high redshift. "}

The topological phases of the system are analyzed by study of the ground state sector of this model, the vortex-free states. Basically, there are two phases, A phase and B phase. The behaviors of both A and B phases may be studied by mapping the ground state sector into a general p-wave paired states of spinless fermions with tunable pairing parameters on a square lattice. In this p-wave paired state theory, the A phase is shown to be the strong paired phase, an insulating phase. The B phase may be either gapped or gapless determined by the generalized inversion symmetry is broken or not. The gapped B is the weak pairing phase described by either the Moore-Read Pfaffian state of the spinless fermions or anti-Pfaffian state of holes depending on the sign of the next nearest neighbor hopping amplitude. A phase transition between Pfaffian and anti-Pfaffian states are found in the gapped B phase. Furthermore, we show that there is a hidden SU(2) gauge symmetry in our model. In the gapped B phase, the ground state has a non-trivial topological number, the spectral first Chern number or the chiral central charge, which reflects the chiral anomaly of the edge state.

We sought to develop a mathematical approach to this problem using, as a test case, one of the most well-studied and clinically important signaling networks in biology today, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) driven signaling cascade. More specifically, we suggest a method, augmented sparse reconstruction, for the identification of links among nodes of ordinary differential equation (ODE) networks from a small set of trajectories with different initial conditions. Our method builds a system of representation by using a collection of integrals of all given trajectories and by attenuating block of terms in the representation itself. The system of representation is then augmented with random vectors, and minimization of the 1-norm is used to find sparse representations for the dynamical interactions of each node. Augmentation by random vectors is crucial, since sparsity alone is not able to handle the large error-in-variables in the representation. Augmented sparse reconstruction allows to consider potentially very large spaces of models and it is able to detect with high accuracy the few relevant links among nodes, even when moderate noise is added to the measured trajectories. After showing the performance of our method on a model of the EGFR protein network, we sketch briefly the potential future therapeutic applications of this approach. "}

Using the smallness of v_c, we develop a perturbative scheme for reconstructing the metric in a galactic halo. In the leading order of expansion in v_c, at the distances r ≳v_c ℓ, our result reproduces that obtained in the Randall-Sundrum braneworld model. This inequality is satisfied in a real spiral galaxy such as our Milky Way for distances r3 kpc, at which the rotational velocity curve becomes flat, v_c7 ×10^-4, if ℓ≲2 Mpc. The gravitational situation in this case can be approximately described by the Einstein equations with the so-called Weyl fluid playing the role of dark matter. In the region near the gravitating body, we derive a closed system of equations for static spherically symmetric situation under the approximation of zero anisotropic stress of the Weyl fluid. We find the Schwarzschild metric to be an approximate vacuum solution of these equations at distances r ≲(r_g ℓ^2)^1/3. The value ℓ≲2 Mpc complies well with the solar-system tests.

Therefore, we were calling on them to do so...", "model": "llama 3.1", "human_text": "In the field of evaluation research, computer scientists live constantly upon dilemmas and conflicting theories. As evaluation is differently perceived and modeled among educational areas, it is not difficult to become trapped in dilemmas, which reflects an epistemological weakness. Additionally, designing and developing a computer-based learning scenario is not an easy task. Advancing further, with end-users probing the system in realistic settings, is even harder. Computer science research in evaluation faces an immense challenge, having to cope with contributions from several conflicting and controversial research fields. We believe that deep changes must be made in our field if we are to advance beyond the CBT (computer-based training) learning model and to build an adequate epistemology for this challenge. The first task is to relocate our field by building upon recent results from philosophy, psychology, social sciences, and engineering. In this article we locate evaluation in respect to communication studies. Evaluation presupposes a definition of goals to be reached, and we suggest that it is, by many means, a silent communication between teacher and student, peers, and institutional entities. If we accept that evaluation can be viewed as set of invisible rules known by nobody, but somehow understood by everybody, we should add anthropological inquiries to our research toolkit. The paper is organized around some elements of the social communication and how they convey new insights to evaluation research for computer and related scientists. We found some technical limitations and offer discussions on how we relate to technology at same time we establish expectancies and perceive others work. "}

The two-dimensional version of the model (one-dimensional interface) is considered, mainly in the adiabatic limit of very slow driving. On length scales shorter than a crossover length (which grows with the strength of surface tension), the effective interface roughness exponent ζ is ≃ 1.20, close to the expected value for the universality class of the quenched Edwards-Wilkinson model. We find that the waiting times between avalanches are fully uncorrelated, as the wavelet transform of their autocorrelations scales as white noise. Similarly, detrended size-size correlations give a white-noise wavelet transform. Consideration of finite driving rates, still deep within the intermittent regime, shows the wavelet transform of correlations scaling as 1/f^1.5 for intermediate frequencies. This behavior is ascribed to intra-avalanche correlations. "}

Second epoch observations of 48 stars with candidates (out of 54) have confirmed that all candidates are unrelated background stars. A detailed statistical analysis of the survey results, yielding upper limits on the fractions of stars with giant planet or low mass brown dwarf companions, is presented.

Changing the initial distributions of rotation and magnetic fields prior to collapse in a parametric manner, we compute 19 models. By so doing, we systematically investigate how rotation and magnetic fields affect the collapse dynamics and explore how the properties of the black-hole formations and neutrino emissions could be affected. As for the microphysics, we employ a realistic equation of state and approximate the neutrino transfer by a multiflavour leakage scheme. With these computations, we find that the jet-like explosions are obtained by the magnetodriven shock waves if the initial magnetic field is as large as 10^12 G. We point out that the black-hole masses at the formation decrease with the initial field strength, on the other hand, increase with the initial rotation rates. As for the neutrino properties, we point out that the degree of the differential rotation plays an important role to determine which species of the neutrino luminosity is more dominant than the others. Furthermore, we find that the stronger magnetic fields make the peak neutrino luminosities smaller, because the magnetic pressure acts to halt the collapse in the central regions, leading to the suppression of the releasable gravitational binding energies.

This makes it a highly expressive temporal logic that is capable of expressing various interesting correctness properties of programs that are not expressible in the modal λ-calculus.This paper provides complexity results for its model checking problem. In particular we consider those fragments of HFL built by using only types of bounded order k and arity m. We establish k-fold exponential time completeness for model checking each such fragment. For the upper bound we use fixpoint elimination to obtain reachability games that are singly-exponential in the size of the formula and k-fold exponential in the size of the underlying transition system. These games can be solved in deterministic linear time. As a simple consequence, we obtain an exponential time upper bound on the expression complexity of each such fragment.The lower bound is established by a reduction from the word problem for alternating (k-1)-fold exponential space bounded Turing Machines. Since there are fixed machines of that type whose word problems are already hard with respect to k-fold exponential time, we obtain, as a corollary, k-fold exponential time completeness for the data complexity of our fragments of HFL, provided m exceeds 3.

However, cosmic ray positron measurements are experimentally very challenging due to the vast proton background. A novel approach of positron identification with the space-borne AMS-01 experiment, namely through the detection of bremsstrahlung conversion in a silicon microstrip detector, is introduced. Bremsstrahlung from protons is suppressed by a factor of more than 3*10^6 with respect to positrons. The results of the positron measurement show that the bremsstrahlung approach extends the sensitivity range of AMS-01 to positron momenta up to 50 GeV/c, which is far beyond the original scope of the experiment. At momenta above 8 GeV/c there is indication for a positron overabundance with respect to model predictions for purely secondary positron production. Therefore, the AMS-01 data lend further weight to the hints of a positron overabundance seen in the data from earlier experiments.The positron fraction measurements from the most recent experiments are combined with the results of this analysis, giving the most precise positron fraction data yet available.

In nature the environmental inputs are noise affected and fuzzy.

It is here presented a new model of Evolutionary Neural Gas (ENG) with any topological constraints, trained by probabilistic laws depending on the local distortion errors and the network dimension. The network is considered as a population of nodes that coexist in an ecosystem sharing local and global resources. Those particular features allow the network to quickly adapt to the environment, according to its dimensions.

However, currently not well-understood was the frequency dependence of SPM.   Our past work had attempted to shed light on this problem by utilizing new data obtained from the giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) at a frequency of 327 MHz; however, it still remained that our previous analysis revealed that the properties of SPM were not only pulsar-specific but also showed strong dependence on observing frequency. We found evidence, in fact, that for at least one pulsar, there was a decrease in SPM period with increasing observing frequency; this had important implications, nonetheless, for understanding the underlying physics behind SPM. Furthermore, it demonstrated the need, indeed, for further observations at different frequencies to fully grasp the frequency dependence of SPM.

In this paper we present the 92-cm data and a comparison is made with the already published 21-cm results. We analysed 191 pulsars at 92 cm using fluctuation spectra. The sample of pulsars is as unbiased as possible towards any particular pulsar characteristics. For 15 pulsars drifting subpulses are discovered for the first time and 26 of the new drifters found in the 21-cm data are confirmed. We discovered nulling for 8 sources and 8 pulsars are found to intermittently emit single pulses that have pulse energies similar to giant pulses. It is estimated that at least half of the total population of pulsars have drifting subpulses when observations with a high enough signal-to-noise ratio would be available. It could well be that the drifting subpulse mechanism is an intrinsic property of the emission mechanism itself, although for some pulsars it is difficult or impossible to detect. Drifting subpulses are in general found at both frequencies, although the chance of detecting drifting subpulses is possibly slightly higher at 92 cm. It appears that the youngest pulsars have the most disordered subpulses and the subpulses become more and more organized into drifting subpulses as the pulsar ages. The correlations with the modulation indices are argued to be consistent with the picture in which the radio emission can be divided in a drifting subpulse signal plus a quasi-steady signal which becomes, on average, stronger at high observing frequencies. The measured values of P3 at the two frequencies are highly correlated, but there is no evidence for a correlation with other pulsar parameters. "}

However, the blob picture raises questions on the nature of this escape transition. To check the theoretical predictions based on the blob picture we study 2d single polymer chains with excluded volume interactions and with one end grafted in the middle of a strip of length2L and width H by simulating self-avoiding walks on a square lattice with the pruned-enriched-Rosenbluth method (PERM). We estimate the free energy, the end-to-end distance, the number of imprisoned monomers, the order parameter, and its distribution. It is shown that in the thermodynamic limit of large N and L but finite L/N, there is a small but finite jump in several average characteristics, including the order parameter. We also present a theoretical description based on the Landau free energy approach, which is in good agreement with the simulation results. Both simulation results and the analytical theory indicate that the 2d escape transition is a weak first-order phase transition. "}

However, we know, from the observation of structures at increasing scales, that these models are only approximations of a smoothed or averaged inhomogeneous underlying patern. Anyhow, when modelling the Universe, the usual method is to use continuous functions representing the kinematical scalars of the velocity field, implicitly assuming that they represent volume averages of the corresponding fine-scale inhomogeneous quantities, then put them into the Einstein equations which are solved to give the model and its dependance upon a number of parameters arbitrarily defined.

The existence of gravitational radiation was first predicted by Einstein in 1916, however gravitational waves have not yet been directly observed. One source of gravitation radiation is binary inspiral. Two compact bodies orbiting each other, such as a pair of black holes, lose energy to gravitational radiation. As the system loses energy the bodies spiral towards each other. This causes their orbital speed and the amount of gravitational radiation to increase, producing a characteristic “chirp” waveform in the LIGO sensitive band. In this thesis, matched filtering of LIGO science data is used to search for low mass binary systems in the halo of dark matter surrounding the Milky Way. Observations of gravitational microlensing events of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud suggest that some fraction of the dark matter in the halo may be in the form of Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). It has been proposed that low mass black holes formed in the early universe may be a component of the MACHO population; some fraction of these black hole MACHOs will be in binary systems and detectable by LIGO. The inspiral from a MACHO binary composed of two 0.5 solar mass black holes enters the LIGO sensitive band around 40 Hz. The chirp signal increases in amplitude and frequency, sweeping through the sensitive band to 4400 Hz in 140 seconds.

The Higgs boson played a crucial role in the process of radiative electroweak symmetry breaking, which explained the small value of the Higgs mass compared to the scale of new physics; although we showed that this process could be triggered radiatively from the top quark loop. In addition, we performed a detailed analysis of the electroweak precision data and obtained constraints on the model parameters, including the size of the extra dimension and the top quark Yukawa coupling; but our results suggested that the model was consistent with the data and provided an alternative explanation for the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking.", "model": "llama 3.1", "human_text": "We compute the Coleman Weinberg effective potential for the Higgs field in RS Gauge-Higgs unification scenarios based on a bulk SO(5) x U(1)_X gauge symmetry, with gauge and fermion fields propagating in the bulk and a custodial symmetry protecting the generation of large corrections to the T parameter and the coupling of the Z to the bottom quark. We demonstrate that electroweak symmetry breaking may be realized, with proper generation of the top and bottom quark masses for the same region of bulk mass parameters that lead to good agreement with precision electroweak data in the presence of a light Higgs. We compute the Higgs mass and demonstrate that for the range of parameters for which the Higgs boson has Standard Model-like properties, the Higgs mass is naturally in a range that varies between values close to the LEP experimental limit and about 160 GeV. This mass range may be probed at the Tevatron and at the LHC. We analyze the KK spectrum and briefly discuss the phenomenology of the light resonances arising in our model. "}

It is shown that under typical conditions, as they are also present in experiments, only a rather weak stretching of the side chains is realized, and then the scaling predictions based on the extension of the Daoud-Cotton blob picture are not applicable.Also two-component bottle brush polymers are considered, where two types (A,B) of side chains are grafted, assuming that monomers of different kind repel each other. In this case, variable solvent quality is allowed for, such that for poor solvent conditions rather dense cylinder-like structures result. Theories predict “Janus Cylinder”-type phase separation along the backbone in this case. The Monte Carlo simulations, using the pruned-enriched Rosenbluth method (PERM) then are restricted to rather short side chain length. Nevertheless, evidence is obtained that the phase separation between an A-rich part of the cylindrical molecule and a B-rich part can only occur locally. The correlation length of this microphase separation can be controlled by the solvent quality. This lack of a phase transition is interpreted by an analogy with models for ferromagnets in one space dimension. "}

Such limits arise because both information and its processing require energy, while gravitational collapse (formation of a horizon or black hole) restricts the amount of energy allowed in a finite region. Specifically, I use a criterion for gravitational collapse called the hoop conjecture. Once the hoop conjecture is assumed a number of results can be obtained directly: the existence of a fundamental uncertainty in spatial distance of order the Planck length, bounds on information (entropy) in a finite region, and a bound on the rate of information processing in a finite region. In the final section I discuss some cosmological issues related to the total amount of information in the universe, and note that almost all detailed aspects of the late universe are determined by the randomness of quantum outcomes.

The globular cluster kinematics were searched for both radial dependence and metallicity dependence by subdividing the globular cluster sample into 158 metal-rich ([Fe/H] > -1.0) and 178 metal-poor ([Fe/H] < -1.0) globular clusters. Our results show the kinematics of the metal-rich and metal-poor subpopulations are quite similar. The kinematics are compared to the planetary nebula population where differences are apparent in the outer regions of the halo. The total mass of NGC 5128 is found using the Tracer Mass estimator (Evans et al. 2003), to determine the mass supported by internal random motions, and the spherical component of the Jeans equation to determine the mass supported by rotation. We find a total mass of (1.0+/-0.2) x 10^(12) Msun from the planetary nebulae data out to a projected radius of 90 kpc and (1.3+/-0.5) x 10^(12) Msun from the globular clusters out to a projected radius of 50 kpc.

Here we argue that these difficulties arise owing to the significant modulation of the solar activity cycle, and that this modulation arises owing to either stochastic or deterministic processes. We analyse the implications for predictability in both of these situations by considering two separate solar dynamo models. The first model represents a stochastically-perturbed flux transport dynamo. Here even very weak stochastic perturbations can give rise to significant modulation in the activity cycle. This modulation leads to a loss of predictability. In the second model, we neglect stochastic effects and assume that generation of magnetic field in the Sun can be described by a fully deterministic nonlinear mean-field model – this is a best case scenario for prediction. We designate the output from this deterministic model (with parameters chosen to produce chaotically modulated cycles) as a target timeseries that subsequent deterministic mean-field models are required to predict. Long-term prediction is impossible even if a model that is correct in all details is utilised in the prediction. Furthermore, we show that even short-term prediction is impossible if there is a small discrepancy in the input parameters from the fiducial model. This is the case even if the predicting model has been tuned to reproduce the output of previous cycles. Given the inherent uncertainties in determining the transport coefficients and nonlinear responses for mean-field models, we argue that this makes predicting the solar cycle using the output from such models impossible.

Such constraints are found to be competitive with those obtained from the dijet data. The current t t̅ data from the Tevatron rule out axigluon masses (m_A) up to 900 GeV and 850 GeV at 2 σ and 4 σ levels respectively. For the case of flavour universal colorons the data rule out a mass (m_C) below 800 GeV (780 GeV) at the 2 (4) σ level and also the mass range between 900 GeV to 2.1 TeV at 2 σ level, for ξ = 1, where ξ is the mixing angle. For ξ =2 on the other hand, the excluded range is m_C950 (920) GeV and m_C1.02 (1.15m_C1.8) TeV at 2 σ (4 σ) level. We point out that for higher axigluon/coloron masses, even for the dijet channel, the limits on the coloron mass, for ξ = 1, may be different than those for the axigluon. We also compute the expected forward-backward asymmetry for the case of the axigluons which would allow it to be discriminated against the SM as also the colorons. We further find that at the LHC, the signal should be visible in the t t̅ invariant mass spectrum for a wide range of axigluon and coloron masses that are still allowed. We point out how top polarisation may be used to further discriminate the axigluon and coloron case from the SM as well as from each other. "}

In this framework an asset is defined by its cash-flow structure. Each cash flow is modelled by a random variable that can be expressed as a function of a collection of independent random variables called market factors. With each such 'X-factor' we associate a market information process, the values of which are accessible to market agents. Each information process is a sum of two terms; one contains true information about the value of the market factor; the other represents 'noise'. The noise term is modelled by an independent Brownian bridge. The market filtration is assumed to be that generated by the aggregate of the independent information processes. The price of an asset is given by the expectation of the discounted cash flows in the risk-neutral measure, conditional on the information provided by the market filtration. When the cash flows are the dividend payments associated with equities, an explicit model is obtained for the share-price, and the prices of options on dividend-paying assets are derived.

For one-dimensional systems the Luttinger liquid approach provides insight into universal properties. Much is known of the equilibrium state, both in the weakly and strongly interacting regime. However, it remains a challenge to probe the dynamics by which this equilibrium state is reached. Here we present a direct experimental study of the coherence dynamics in both isolated and coupled degenerate 1d Bose gases. Dynamic splitting is used to create two 1d systems in a phase coherent state. The time evolution of the coherence is revealed in local phase shifts of the subsequently observed interference patterns. Completely isolated 1d Bose gases are observed to exhibit a universal sub-exponential coherence decay in excellent agreement with recent predictions by Burkov et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 200404 (2007)]. For two coupled 1d Bose gases the coherence factor is observed to approach a non-zero equilibrium value as predicted by a Bogoliubov approach. This coupled-system decay to finite coherence is the matter wave equivalent of phase locking two lasers by injection. The non-equilibrium dynamics of superfluids plays an important role in a wide range of physical systems, such as superconductors, quantum-Hall systems, superfluid Helium, and spin systems. Our experiments studying coherence dynamics show that 1d Bose gases are ideally suited for investigating this class of phenomena. "}

Using thermalized negative Cl- ions we find that the evaporative loss rate is proportional to a Boltzmann factor. This thermodynamic description sheds new light on the dynamics of particles in time-varying confining potentials. It specifically allows us to extract the effective depth of the ion trap as the activation energy for evaporation. As a function of the rf amplitude we find two distinct regimes related to the stability of motion of the trapped ions. For low amplitudes the entire trap allows for stable motion and the trap depth increases with the rf field. For larger rf amplitudes, however, rapid energy transfer from the field to the ion motion can occur at large trap radii, which leads to a reduction of the effective trapping volume. In this regime the trap depth decreases again with increasing rf amplitude. We give an analytical parameterization of the trap depth for various multipole traps that allows predictions of the most favorable trapping conditions. "}

The investigation of long GRBs therefore requires modeling the propagation of ultra-relativistic blastwaves through the circumburst medium surrounding massive stars. We simulate the expansion of an isotropic, adiabatic relativistic fireball into the wind-shaped medium around a massive GRB progenitor. The circumburst medium is composed of a realistically stratified stellar wind zone up to its termination shock, followed by a region of shocked wind characterized by a constant density. Aims: We followed the evolution of the blastwave through all its stages, including the extremely rapid acceleration up to a Lorentz factor 75 flow, its deceleration by interaction with stellar wind, its passage of the wind termination shock, until its propagation through shocked wind. Methods: We used the adaptive mesh refinement versatile advection code to follow the evolution of the fireball. Results: We show that the acceleration from purely thermal to ultra-relativistic kinetic regimes is abrupt and produces an internally structured blastwave. We resolved the structure of this ultra-relativistic shell in all stages, thanks to the adaptive mesh. We comment on the dynamical roles played by forward and reverse shock pairs in the phase of interaction with the free stellar wind and clearly identify the complex shock-dominated structure created when the shell crosses the terminal shock. Conclusion: We show that in our model where the terminal shock is taken relatively close to the massive star, the phase of self-similar deceleration of Blandford-McKee type can only be produced in the constant density, shocked wind zone.

Among these, the most striking is oxygen depletion, which reaches values down to [O/Fe] -0.4 in most clusters, but in M13 it goes down to less than [O/Fe]- 1. In this work we suggest that the anomalies are due to the super position of two different events: 1) PRIMORDIAL SELF-ENRICHMENT: this is asked to explain the oxygen depletion down to a minimum value [O/Fe]-0.4; 2) EXTRA MIXING IN A FRACTION OF THE STARS ALREADY BORN WITH ANOMALOUS COMPOSITION: these objects, starting with already low [O/Fe], will reduce the oxygen abundance down to the most extreme values. Contrary to other models that invoke extra mixing to explain the chemical anomalies, we suggest that it is active only if there is a fraction of the stars in which the primordial composition is not only oxygen depleted, but also extremely helium rich (Y0.4), as found in a few GCs from their main sequence multiplicity. We propose that the rotational evolution (and an associated extra mixing) of extremely helium rich stars may be affected by the fact that they develop a very small or non existent molecular weight barrier during the evolution. We show that extra mixing in these stars, having initial chemistry that has already been CNO processed, affects mainly the oxygen abundance, and to a much smaller extent if affects the sodium abundance. The model also predicts a large fluorine depletion concomitant with the oxygen depletion, and a further enhancement of the surface helium abundance, which reaches values close to Y=0.5 in the computed models. We stress that, in this tentative explanation, those stars that are primordially O–depleted, but ARE NOT extremely helium rich do not suffer deep extra mixing. "}

The sample was observed with medium-resolution, optical spectroscopy and contains some galaxies with unpublished velocity dispersion measurements and emission-line fluxes. Measured velocity dispersions are 130-340 km/s with a mean of 216 km/s. Converting to BH mass, we find that the BH mass distribution is identical for FRIs and FRIIs, with a mean of approximately 2.5x10^8 Msun. We convert [OII] and [OIII] emission-line luminosities to photoionizing luminosity under the assumption that the gas is ionized by the nuclear UV continuum. Most of the galaxies with FRI morphology and/or low-excitation emission-line spectra have progressively lower BH masses at lower photoionizing (and jet) luminosities. This agrees with the Ledlow-Owen relation which states that the radio luminosity at the FRI/FRII transition depends on the optical luminosity of the host, L_radioL_optical^1.8, because both L_radio and L_optical relate to AGN nuclear parameters. When recasting the Ledlow-Owen relation into BH mass versus photoionizing and jet luminosity, we find that the recasted relation describes the sample quite well. The FRI/FRII transition occurs at approximately an order of magnitude lower luminosity relative to the Eddington luminosity than the soft-to-hard transition in X-ray binaries. This difference is consistent with the Ledlow-Owen relation, which predicts a weak BH mass dependence in the transition luminosity. We conclude that the FRI/FRII dichotomy is caused by a combination of external and nuclear factors, with the latter dominating. "}

We find that increasing mass is divergent, possibly chaotic. We also investigate the possible existence of a Power Law for atomic nuclei and, using also the technique of the variogram, we conclude that a fractal regime could superintend to the mechanism of increasing mass for nuclei. Finally, using the Hurst exponent, evidence is obtained that the mechanism of increasing mass in atomic nuclei is in the fractional Brownian regime. The most interesting results are obtained by using Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA). New recurrences, psudoperiodicities, self-resemblance and class of self-similarities are identified with values of determinism showing oscillating values indicating the presence of more or less stability during the process of increasing mass of atomic nuclei.

The power spectral density (PSD) of the Vm displays a power-law structure at high frequencies (>50 Hz) with a slope of about -2.5. This type of frequency scaling cannot be accounted for by traditional models, as either single-compartment models or models based on reconstructed cell morphologies display a frequency scaling with a slope close to -4. This slope is due to the fact that the membrane resistance is 'short-circuited' by the capacitance for high frequencies, a situation which may not be realistic. Here, we integrate non-ideal capacitors in cable equations to reflect the fact that the capacitance cannot be charged instantaneously. We show that the resulting 'non-ideal' cable model can be solved analytically using Fourier transforms. Numerical simulations using a ball-and-stick model yield membrane potential activity with similar frequency scaling as in the experiments. We also discuss the consequences of using non-ideal capacitors on other cellular properties such as the transmission of high frequencies, which is boosted in non-ideal cables, or voltage attenuation in dendrites. These results suggest that cable equations based on non-ideal capacitors should be used to capture the behavior of neuronal membranes at high frequencies. "}

If the barriers oscillate out of phase the system operates like a turnstile pump under a finite constant bias, as observed in the experiments of Kouwenhoven et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 67, 1626 (1991)]. The time-dependent currents and their averages over succesive pumping periods are computed from the Keldysh formalism for tight-binding models. The calculation considers a sudden application of the pumping potentials at t=0 which leads to transient features of the time-dependent and averaged currents during the first pumping cycles which turn out to be important in the high-frequency regime. We show that in the transient regime the efficiency of the system as a pump is rather poor because it mainly absorbs charge from both leads in order to fill the levels located below the bias window. Under a finite bias and a low-frequency pumping signal the charge transferred across the system depends on the number of levels located within the bias window. The internal charge dynamics and the role of energy sidebands are investigated. The so called satellite peaks of the averaged current are observed also in the transient regime. "}
{"machine_text": "In this work, we aim to investigate the properties of holography in the three-dimensional Kerr-de Sitter space with a gravitational Chern-Simons term. The motivation behind this research comes from the desire to better understand the behavior of gravity in spaces with nontrivial topologies. In particular, we focus on a spacetime that has a black hole in the center, rotating around its axis, and surrounded by a cosmological constant. The inclusion of a Chern-Simons term leads to a modification of the Einstein-Hilbert action and, therefore, causes various effects in the holographic dual theory.The problem that our work attempts to solve is to shed light on the connection between the geometric properties of the spacetime and the dual field theory.

The long (120 ks) exposure with chandra HETG allows a detailed study of the soft X-ray continuum and of the narrow component of the Fe Kalpha line. The rxte PCA data are used to put an upper limit on the broad line component and constrain the hard X-ray continuum. A strong soft excess below 1 keV is observed in the time-averaged HETG spectrum, which can be parameterized with a steep power law or a thermal model. The flux variability at low energies indicates that the origin of the soft excess cannot be entirely ascribed to the circumnuclear diffuse emission, detected by chandra on scales of 20-30 arcsec (22-33 kpc). A narrow (sigma<90 eV) Fe Kalpha line (with EW< 100 eV) is observed by the chandra HEG. Similar values for the line parameters are measured by the rxte PCA, suggesting that the contribution from a broad line component is negligible. The fact that the exposure is split into two observations taken three days apart allows us to investigate the spectral and temporal evolution of the source on different timescales. Significant flux variability associated with spectral changes is observed on timescales of hours and days.

We found that the KATRIN experiment has an impressive sensitivity to the neutrino mass, with a projected uncertainty of 0.2 eV, which is competitive with other existing and planned experiments. We also studied the sensitivity to right-handed currents by simulating several hypothetical scenarios and found that KATRIN can set strong constraints on this type of new physics.   To achieve these results, we used a Monte Carlo simulation of the KATRIN spectrometer, which is designed to measure the shape of the electron energy spectrum in tritium beta decay. This energy spectrum is sensitive to the neutrino mass and to possible right-handed currents, and KATRIN will measure it with unprecedented precision. Our methodology includes a detailed analysis of the systematic uncertainties and a statistical treatment of the simulated data.   In conclusion, our work demonstrates that KATRIN is a powerful tool for studying the neutrino mass and searching for new physics beyond the Standard Model. These results motivate future improvements of the experiment and inspire new theoretical ideas for the interpretation of the data. \n\n                  for this text I want you to change the tense of every sentence.

This symmetry breaking between limiting cycles driven by an external signal is discussed in terms of the concept of (out-of-equilibrium) Dynamic Phase Transitions between DOS and DDS, similar to those encountered when a magnetic system is placed in the presence of a variable external magnetic field.

In June 2006, the target was exposed for 18 hours to a 800-MeV proton beam extracted from the ITEP U-10 accelerator. The proton fluence and the proton beam shape were determined using the 27Al(p,x)7Be monitor reaction. The reaction rates were determined by the direct gamma-spectrometry techniques. In total, 1196 gamma-spectra have been measured, and about 1500 reaction rates determined. The measured reaction rates were simulated by the MCNPX code using the following databases: ENDF/B6 for neutrons below 20 MeV, MENDL2 for 20-100 MeV neutrons, and MENDL2P for proton cross sections up to 200 MeV.

Here we present an integrated experimental and theoretical framework to understand and quantitatively predict how and when information spreads over social networks. Using data collected in Viral Marketing campaigns that reached over 31,000 individuals in eleven European markets, we show the large degree of variability of the participants' actions, despite them being confronted with the common task of receiving and forwarding the same piece of information. This have a profound effect on information diffusion: Firstly, most of the transmission takes place due to super-spreading events which would be considered extraordinary in population-average models. Secondly, due to the different way individuals schedule information transmission we observe a slowing down of the spreading of information in social networks that happens in logarithmic time. Quantitative description of the experiments is possible through an stochastic branching process which corroborates the importance of heterogeneity. Since high variability of both the intensity and frequency of human responses are found in many other activities, our findings are pertinent to many other human driven diffusion processes like rumors, fads, innovations or news which has important consequences for organizations management, communications, marketing or electronic social communities.

Apart from the standard contributions, the perturbations above the Friedmann background contain an extra piece which is proportional to an arbitrary function theta(x) of the space coordinates. This function appears as an integration constant and corresponds to a non-propagating scalar mode which may, however, become dynamical with the account of the higher-derivative corrections. For -1 < gamma < 0 and gamma = 1 the “anomalous” perturbations grow slower than the standard ones and thus the model is compatible with observations.

Having been motivated by the need for better understanding of physical mechanisms involved in Compton scattering process in magnetic cataclysmic variables, which could then be applied to other astrophysical phenomena, we carried out simulations of Compton scattering of Fe K alpha lines using different magnetic field strengths, viewing angles, and column densities; these results were compared with observations of magnetic cataclysmic variables with known magnetic field strengths. Having shown that the presence of strong magnetic fields significantly affects Compton scattering of Fe K alpha lines, we found that scattering fraction varied with magnetic field strength, column density, and viewing angle; however, this variation was not affected by our previous expectations, where we had assumed that Compton scattering would only be affected by magnetic field strength.

The peak line emissivities of the photons in the post-shock flow are taken into consideration and frequency shifts due to Doppler effects are also included. We find that line profiles are most distorted by Compton scattering effects in strongly magnetized mCVs with a low white dwarf mass and high mass accretion rate and which are viewed at an oblique angle with respect to the accretion column. The resulting line profiles are most sensitive to the inclination angle. We have also explored the effects of modifying the accretion column width and using a realistic emissivity profile. We find that these do not have a significant overall effect on the resulting line profiles. A comparison of our simulated line spectra with high resolution Chandra/HETGS observations of the mCV GK Per indicates that a wing feature redward of the 6.4 keV line may result from Compton recoil near the base of the accretion column.

The hard X-rays are fit by two power-laws of the same slope, absorbed by columns of 1.5 and 7 * 10^23 cm^-2 respectively. The spectrum is consistent with previous suggestions that the power-law components are X-ray emission from the sub-pc VLBI jet and from Bondi accretion at the core, but it is also consistent with a partial covering interpretation. The soft band is dominated by thermal emission from the diffuse plasma and is fit well by a two-temperature VAPEC model, plus a third power-law component to account for scattered nuclear emission, jet emission, and emission from X-ray Binaries and other point sources. Narrow fluorescent emission lines from Fe, Si, S, Ar, Ca and Ni are detected. The Fe K alpha line width yields a 200 light-day lower limit on the distance from the black hole to the line-emitting gas. Fe, Ca, and S K-shell absorption edges are detected.

Strengthening the results in our previous letter [1], we confirm that a good, regular and consistent description of signature change is achieved in these brane/shells scenarios, while keeping the hypersurface and the bulk completely regular. Our formalism allows for a unified description of the traditional timelike branes/shells together with the signature-changing, or pure null, ones. This allows for a detailed comparison of the results in both situations. An application to the case of hypersurface layers in static bulks is presented, leading to the general Robertson-Walker geometry on the layer –with a possible signature change. Explicit examples on anti de Sitter bulks are then studied. The permitted behaviours in different settings (Z_2-mirror branes, asymmetric shells, signature-changing branes) are analysed in detail. We show in particular that (i) in asymmetric shells there is an upper bound for the energy density, and (ii) that the energy density within the brane vanishes when approaching a change of signature. The description of a signature change as a `singularity' seen from within the brane is considered. We also find new relations between the fundamental constants in the brane/shell, its tension, and the cosmological and gravitational constants of the bulk, independently of the existence or not of a change of signature.

We want to constrain the physical properties of the short GRB 050724 and of its host galaxy, and make some inferences on the global short GRB population. We present optical observations of the afterglow of GRB 050724 and of its host galaxy, significantly expanding the existing dataset for this event. We compare our results with models, complementing them with available measurements from the literature. We study the afterglow light curve and spectrum including X-ray data. We also present observations of the host galaxy. The observed optical emission was likely related to the large flare observed in the X-ray light curve. The apparent steep decay was therefore not due to the jet effect. Available data are indeed consistent with low collimation, in turn implying a large energy release, comparable to that of long GRBs. The flare properties also constrain the internal shock mechanism, requiring a large Lorentz factor contrast between the colliding shells. This implies that the central engine was active at late times, rather than ejecting all shells simultaneously. The host galaxy has red colors and no ongoing star formation, consistent with previous findings on this GRB. However, it is not a pure elliptical, and has some faint spiral structure. GRB 050724 provides the most compelling case for association between a short burst and a galaxy with old stellar population. It thus plays a pivotal role in constraining progenitors models, which should allow for long delays between birth and explosion. "}

In the present paper we first study the effect of orientational order on depletion forces in this particular binary system, comparing our results with those obtained adopting the usual approximation of considering the rods parallel and their orientations frozen. We consider mixtures with rods of different aspect ratios and spheres of different diameters, and we treat them within Onsager theory. Our results indicate that depletion effects, and consequently smectic stability, decrease significantly as a result of orientational disorder in the smectic phase when compared with corresponding data based on the frozen–orientation approximation. These results are discussed in terms of the τ parameter, which has been proposed as a convenient measure of depletion strength. We present closed expressions for τ, and show that it is intimately connected with the depletion potential. We then analyse the effect of particle geometry by comparing results pertaining to systems of parallel rods of different shapes (spherocylinders, cylinders and parallelepipeds). We finally provide results based on the Zwanzig approximation of a Fundamental–Measure density–functional theory applied to mixtures of parallelepipeds and cubes of different sizes. In this case, we show that the τ parameter exhibits a linear asymptotic behaviour in the limit of large values of the hard–rod aspect ratio, in conformity with Onsager theory, as well as in the limit of large values of the ratio of rod breadth to cube side length, d, in contrast to Onsager approximation, which predicts τ∼ d^3.

We have focused our interest mostly on carbon nitride (CNx) since nitrogen promotes the formation of FL arrangements at low substrate temperatures and they are emerging over pure carbon coatings in tribological applications such as protective overcoats in magnetic hard disks. We address structural issues such as origin of plane curvature, nature of the cross-linking sites and sp2 clustering, together with growth mechanisms based on the role of film-forming precursors, chemical re-sputtering or concurrent ion assistance during growth.

In the Gorenstein case, i.e. when h_e=1, we also supply the Gorenstein Interval Conjecture (GIC), which naturally generalizes the IC, and basically states that the same property simultaneously holds for any two symmetric entries, say h_i and h_e-i, of a Gorenstein h-vector.These conjectures are inspired by the research performed in this area over the last few years. A series of recent results seems to indicate that it will be nearly impossible to characterize explicitly the sets of all Gorenstein or of all level Hilbert functions. Therefore, our conjectures would at least provide the existence of a very strong - and natural - form of order in the structure of such important and complicated sets.We are still far from proving the conjectures at this point. However, we will already solve a few interesting cases, especially when it comes to the IC, in this paper. Among them, that of Gorenstein h-vectors of socle degree 4, that of level h-vectors of socle degree 2, and that of non-unimodal level h-vectors of socle degree 3 and any given codimension. "}
