Our approach combines the post-Newtonian expansion and the EOB Hamiltonian with a high-accuracy phenomenological model to capture the intricate dynamics of these systems. We employ a novel time-reversal symmetry-preserving regularization scheme, which ensures that our waveforms satisfy the correct physical properties at all frequencies. This method allows us to accurately compute EOB waveforms for binaries with mass ratios as low as 1:10 and total masses up to several hundred solar masses. The resulting waveforms exhibit excellent agreement with numerical simulations from other methods and provide a reliable tool for testing the accuracy of gravitational-wave data analysis pipelines in the small-mass-ratio regime, thereby informing future observations by LIGO and VIRGO detectors.", "human_text": "  We address the problem of constructing high-accuracy, faithful analytic waveforms describing the gravitational wave signal emitted by inspiralling and coalescing binary black holes. We work within the Effective-One-Body (EOB) framework and propose a methodology for improving the current (waveform)implementations of this framework based on understanding, element by element, the physics behind each feature of the waveform, and on systematically comparing various EOB-based waveforms with ``exact'' waveforms obtained by numerical relativity approaches. The present paper focuses on small-mass-ratio non-spinning binary systems, which can be conveniently studied by Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli-type methods. Our results include: (i) a resummed, 3PN-accurate description of the inspiral waveform, (ii) a better description of radiation reaction during the plunge, (iii) a refined analytic expression for the plunge waveform, (iv) an improved treatment of the matching between the plunge and ring-down waveforms. This improved implementation of the EOB approach allows us to construct complete analytic waveforms which exhibit a remarkable agreement with the ``exact'' ones in modulus, frequency and phase. In particular, the analytic and numerical waveforms stay in phase, during the whole process, within $\\pm 1.1 %$ of a cycle. We expect that the extension of our methodology to the comparable-mass case will be able to generate comparably accurate analytic waveforms of direct use for the ground-based network of interferometric detectors of gravitational waves.

We develop a theoretical framework for understanding the pairing dynamics in Fermi gases and demonstrate the feasibility of this approach using a combination of mean-field theory and numerical simulations. By exploiting the pairing mechanism, we show that it is possible to achieve quantum degeneracy with higher efficiency and accuracy than traditional evaporative cooling methods, paving the way for the creation of novel quantum many-body systems.", "human_text": "  We propose a pairing-based method for cooling an atomic Fermi gas. A three component (labels 1, 2, 3) mixture of Fermions is considered where the components 1 and 2 interact and, for instance, form pairs whereas the component 3 is in the normal state. For cooling, the components 2 and 3 are coupled by an electromagnetic field. Since the quasiparticle distributions in the paired and in the normal states are different, the coupling leads to cooling of the normal state even when initially $T_{paired}\\geq T_{normal}$ (notation $T_S\\geq T_N$). The cooling efficiency is given by the pairing energy and by the linewidth of the coupling field. No superfluidity is required: any type of pairing, or other phenomenon that produces a suitable spectral density, is sufficient. In principle, the paired state could be cooled as well but this requires $T_N<T_S$. The method has a conceptual analogy to cooling based on superconductor -- normal metal (SN) tunneling junctions. Main differences arise from the exact momentum conservation in the case of the field-matter coupling vs. non-conservation of momentum in the solid state tunneling process. Moreover, the role of processes that relax the energy conservation requirement in the tunneling, e.g. thermal fluctuations of an external reservoir, is now played by the linewidth of the field. The proposed method should be experimentally feasible due to its close connection to RF-spectroscopy of ultracold gases which is already in use. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

We examine the spectra of 137 quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, to search for such voids, and find no clear evidence of their existence. The size distribution of voids in the range 5-70 Angstrom (corresponding to physical sizes of approximately 3-35 comoving Mpc/h) is consistent with the standard model for the Lyman alpha forest without additional hot bubbles. We adapt a physical model for HII bubble growth during cosmological reionization (Furlanetto, Zaldarriaga and Hernquist 2004), to describe the expected size-distribution of hot super-bubbles at redshift around z = 3. This model incorporates the conjoining of bubbles around individual neighboring galaxies. Using the non-detection of voids, we find that models in which the volume filling factor of hot bubbles exceeds approximately 20 percent at z=3 can be ruled out, primarily because they overproduce the number of large (40-50 Angstrom) voids. We conclude that any pre-heating mechanism that explains galaxy cluster observations must avoid heating the low-density gas in the proto-cluster regions, either by operating relatively recently (z<3) or by depositing entropy in the high-density regions.

Our results indicate that dry mergers can trigger the formation of fast rotators through the redistribution of angular momentum, while AGN feedback facilitates the removal of gas from the galaxy, leading to the emergence of slow rotators.

We find that boxy galaxies originate from mergers with a progenitor mass ratio $n < 2$ and with a combined cold gas mass fraction $F_{\\rm cold} < 0.1$. Our model accurately reproduces the observed fraction of boxy systems as a function of luminosity and halo mass, for both central galaxies and satellites. After correcting for the stellar mass dependence, the properties of the last major merger of early-type galaxies are independent of their halo mass. This provides theoretical support for the conjecture of Pasquali et al (2007) that the stellar mass of an early-type galaxy is the main parameter that governs its isophotal shape. We argue that the observed dichotomy of early-type galaxies has a natural explanation within hierarchical structure formation, and does not require AGN feedback. Rather, we argue that it owes to the fact that more massive systems (i) have more massive progenitors, (ii) assemble later, and (iii) have a larger fraction of early-type progenitors. Each of these three trends causes the cold gas mass fraction of the progenitors of more massive early-types to be lower, so that their last major merger was dryer. Finally, our model predicts that (i) less than 10 percent of all early-type galaxies form in major mergers that involve two early-type progenitors, (ii) more than 95 percent of all boxy early-type galaxies with $M_* < 2 \\times 10^{10} h^{-1} \\Msun$ are satellite galaxies, and (iii) about 70 percent of all low mass early-types do not form a supermassive black hole binary at their last major merger.

A successive iteration procedure results in new classes of solutions characterized by an infinite number of parameters for a non-Abelian group involving arbitrary functions on one variable.

It is remarkable that the asymmetrically extended 8 micron emission in NGC 5044 is spatially coincident with Halpha+[NII] emission from warm gas. A calculation shows that dust-assisted cooling in buoyant hot gas moving out from the galactic core can cool within a few kpc in about ~10^7 yrs, explaining the optical line emission observed. The X-ray images of both galaxies are disturbed.

We find that the CO J=4-3 and J=6-5 transitions trace a different gas phase from that dominating the lower three CO transitions, with n(H_2) ~ (1-3)x10^4 cm-3 and Tk ~ (40-70) K. This phase is responsible for the luminous HCN emission, and contains most of the H2 gas mass of this galaxy. The total CO line cooling emanating from this dense phase is found similar to that of the [CII] line at 158 micron, suggesting a very different thermal balance to that seen in lower IR-luminosity galaxies, and one likely dominated by dense photon-dominated regions. Our dense \"sampling\" of the CO rotational ladder and the HCN lines enables us to produce well-constrained Spectral Line Energy Distributions (SLEDs) for the dense molecular gas in Mrk231 and compare them to those of high redshift starbursts, many of which have SLEDs that may be affected by strong lensing.

By leveraging advanced mathematical tools, we provide an accurate quantitative description of optical precursors in terms of their temporal profiles and spatial characteristics.

The propagated field is given in terms of an integral of a Fourier type, which cannot be evaluated even for simple models of the dispersive dielectric. The fact that the oscillators have a low number density (dilute medium) and have a narrow-band resonance allows us to simplify the integrand. In this case, the integral can be evaluated exactly, although it is not possible using this method to separate out the transient part of the propagated field known as optical precursors. We also use an asymptotic method (saddle-point method) to evaluate the integral. The contributions to the integral related to the saddle-points of the integrand give rise to the optical precursors. We obtain analytic expressions for the precursor fields and the domain over which the asymptotic method is valid. When combined to obtain the total transient field, we find that the agreement between the solutions obtained by the asymptotic and the exact methods is excellent. Our results demonstrate that precursors can persist for many nanoseconds and the chirp in the instantaneous frequency of the precursors can manifest itself in beats in the transmitted intensity. Our work strongly suggests that precursors have been observed in many previous experiments. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

Solving these equation we obtain decoherence and relaxation rates of the qubit, as well as the spectral density of the fluctuating qubit's parameters. We found that in the weak coupling regime the decoherence and relaxation rates are directly related to the spectral density taken at Rabi or at zero frequency, depending on what a particular qubit's parameters is fluctuating. This relation holds also in the presence of weak back-action of the qubit on the fluctuating environment. In the case of strong back-action, such simple relationship no longer holds, even if the qubit-SET coupling is small.

By employing advanced techniques in mesh refinement, shock capturing, and gauge conditions, we have successfully computed high-quality simulations that accurately describe the final stages of binary black hole coalescence, including extreme recoil velocities approaching 10% of the speed of light.

Many authors have therefore considered gene duplication as a driving force in shaping the topology of molecular networks. In particular it has been noted that growth via duplication would act as an implicit way of preferential attachment, and thereby provide the observed broad degree distributions of molecular networks.   Results: We extend current models of gene duplication and rewiring by including directions and the fact that molecular networks are not a result of unidirectional growth. We introduce upstream sites and downstream shapes to quantify potential links during duplication and rewiring. We find that this in itself generates the observed scaling of transcription factors for genome sites in procaryotes. The dynamical model can generate a scale-free degree distribution, p(k)&prop; 1/k^&gamma;, with exponent &gamma;=1 in the non-growing case, and with &gamma;>1 when the network is growing.   Conclusions: We find that duplication of genes followed by substantial recombination of upstream regions could generate main features of genetic regulatory networks. Our steady state degree distribution is however to broad to be consistent with data, thereby suggesting that selective pruning acts as a main additional constraint on duplicated genes. Our analysis shows that gene duplication can only be a main cause for the observed broad degree distributions, if there is also substantial recombinations between upstream regions of genes.

It is also related to results due to Parthasarathy on the dimension of completely entangled subspaces, which have connections with the construction of unextendible product bases. Here we take as entanglement measure the Schmidt rank, and determine, for every pair of local dimensions dA and dB, and every r, the largest dimension of a subspace consisting only of entangled states of Schmidt rank r or larger. This exact answer is a significant improvement on the best bounds that can be obtained using random subspace techniques. We also determine the converse: the largest dimension of a subspace with an upper bound on the Schmidt rank.

In this setting, a classical result due to Reeb \\cite{Reeb} states that a manifold admitting a foliation with exactly two center-type singularities is a sphere. In particular this is true if the foliation is given by a function. Along these lines a result due to Eells and Kuiper \\cite{Ku-Ee} classify manifolds having a real-valued function admitting exactly three non-degenerate singular points. In the present paper, we prove a generalization of the above mentioned results. To do this, we first describe the possible arrangements of pairs of singularities and the corresponding codimension one invariant sets, and then we give an elimination procedure for suitable center-saddle and some saddle-saddle configurations (of consecutive indices). In the second part, we investigate if other classical results, such as Haefliger and Novikov (Compact Leaf) theorems, proved for regular foliations, still hold true in presence of singularities. At this purpose, in the singular set, $Sing(\\F)$ of the foliation $\\F$, we consider {\\em{weakly stable}} components, that we define as those components admitting a neighborhood where all leaves are compact. If $Sing(\\F)$ admits only weakly stable components, given by smoothly embedded curves diffeomorphic to $S^1$, we are able to extend Haefliger's theorem.

We re-examine the constraints on this scenario from the presently available cosmological data and investigate the sensitivity expected from the Planck satellite.

Our work aimed to address the fundamental question of how the magnetoelectric behavior arises in BiFeO$_3$, particularly the interplay between its structural, magnetic, and electric properties. We employed a combination of first-principles calculations and density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the electronic structure and magnetic interactions within the material. By analyzing the results, we gained insight into the origins of magnetoelectricity in BiFeO$_3$, including the role of spin-orbit coupling and the involvement of specific atomic orbitals in mediating the magnetic and electric responses.", "human_text": "  The magnetoelectric behavior of BiFeO$_3$ has been explored on the basis of accurate density functional calculations. The structural, electronic, magnetic, and ferroelectric properties of BiFeO$_3$ are predicted correctly without including strong correlation effect in the calculation. Moreover, the experimentally-observed elongation of cubic perovskite-like lattice along the [111] direction is correctly reproduced. At high pressure we predicted a pressure-induced structural transition and the total energy calculations at expanded lattice show two lower energy ferroelectric phases, closer in energy to the ground state phase. Band-structure calculations show that BiFeO$_3$ will be an insulator in A- and G-type antiferromagnetic phases and a metal in other magnetic configurations. Chemical bonding in BiFeO$_3$ has been analyzed using various tools and electron localization function analysis shows that stereochemically active lone-pair electrons at the Bi sites are responsible for displacements of the Bi atoms from the centro-symmetric to the noncentrosymmetric structure and hence the ferroelectricity. A large ferroelectric polarization (88.7 $\\mu$C/cm$^{2}$) is predicted in accordance with recent experimental findings. The net polarization is found to mainly ($>$ 98%) originate from Bi atoms. Moreover the large scatter in experimentally reported polarization values is due to the large anisotropy in the spontaneous polarization. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

We employ numerical methods to solve the coupled MHD and heat conduction equations, accounting for the feedback effects of thermal energy on cloud evolution. The results reveal that heat conduction significantly influences cloud dynamics, particularly in regions where the plasma is sufficiently hot. Our findings indicate a more nuanced understanding of cloud formation, where heat transfer drives the condensation of dense gas, leading to the creation of complex structures.

We use the thermal conductivity of a fully ionized hydrogen plasma proposed by Spitzer and a saturated heat flux according to Cowie & McKee in regions where the mean free path of the electrons is large compared to the temperature scaleheight. Significant structural and evolutionary differences occur between simulations with and without heat conduction. Dense clouds in pure dynamical models experience dynamical destruction by Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability. In static models heat conduction leads to evaporation of such clouds. Heat conduction acting on clouds in a gas stream smooths out steep temperature and density gradients at the edge of the cloud because the conduction timescale is shorter than the cooling timescale. This diminishes the velocity gradient between the streaming plasma and the cloud, so that the timescale for the onset of KH instabilities increases, and the surface of the cloud becomes less susceptible to KH instabilities. The stabilisation effect of heat conduction against KH instability is more pronounced for smaller and less massive clouds. As in the static case more realistic cloud conditions allow heat conduction to transfer hot material onto the cloud's surface and to mix the accreted gas deeper into the cloud.

The method is designed to eliminate the problems inherent in the rate-equation formalism to surface chemistry.

The surface chemical network consists of a small number of diffusive reactions that can produce molecular oxygen, water, carbon dioxide, formaldehyde, methanol and assorted radicals. METHOD: The simulation is started by running a gas-phase model including accretion onto grains but no surface chemistry or evaporation. The starting surface consists of either flat or rough olivine. We introduce the surface chemistry of the three species H, O and CO in an iterative manner using our stochastic technique. Under the conditions of the simulation, only atomic hydrogen can evaporate to a significant extent. Although it has little effect on other gas-phase species, the evaporation of atomic hydrogen changes its gas-phase abundance, which in turn changes the flux of atomic hydrogen onto grains. The effect on the surface chemistry is treated until convergence occurs. We neglect all non-thermal desorptive processes. RESULTS: We determine the mantle abundances of assorted molecules as a function of time through 2x10^5 yr. Our method also allows determination of the abundance of each molecule in specific monolayers. The mantle results can be compared with observations of water, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and methanol ices in the sources W33A and Elias 16. Other than a slight underproduction of mantle CO, our results are in very good agreement with observations. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

We find that if the GRB jet has a core-envelope structure, the predicted distribution of the decay index of the tail has a wide scatter and has multiple peaks, which cannot be seen for the case of the uniform and the Gaussian jet. Therefore, the decay index distribution tells us the information on the jet structure.

One-range addition theorems are expansions in terms of functions that are complete and orthonormal in a given Hilbert space, but Guseinov replaced the complete and orthonormal functions by nonorthogonal Slater-type functions and rearranged the resulting expansions. This is a dangerous operation whose validity must be checked. It is shown that the one-center limit $\\bm{r}' = \\bm{0}$ of Guseinov's rearranged Yukawa addition theorems as well as of several other addition theorems does not exist. Moreover, the Coulomb potential does not belong to any of the Hilbert spaces implicitly used by Guseinov. Accordingly, one-range addition theorems for the Coulomb potential diverge in the mean.

This work focuses on the rigorous treatment of singularities at interfaces between different physical domains, where classical numerical methods often fail due to loss of accuracy or stability. Our spectral approach leverages high-order polynomial expansions and optimized basis functions to systematically resolve the interface discontinuities, ensuring optimal convergence rates for both interior and exterior solutions. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate the superiority of our method over traditional techniques in terms of solution accuracy and computational efficiency, while also providing a robust framework for addressing complex physical phenomena involving coupled PDEs with interface singularities. The outcomes of this research have significant implications for various applications, including electromagnetic scattering problems, heat transfer analysis, and fluid dynamics simulations, underscoring the potential of spectral methods to revolutionize numerical computations in these areas.", "human_text": "  A spectral method is described for solving coupled elliptic problems on an interior and an exterior domain. The method is formulated and tested on the two-dimensional interior Poisson and exterior Laplace problems, whose solutions and their normal derivatives are required to be continuous across the interface. A complete basis of homogeneous solutions for the interior and exterior regions, corresponding to all possible Dirichlet boundary values at the interface, are calculated in a preprocessing step. This basis is used to construct the influence matrix which serves to transform the coupled boundary conditions into conditions on the interior problem. Chebyshev approximations are used to represent both the interior solutions and the boundary values. A standard Chebyshev spectral method is used to calculate the interior solutions. The exterior harmonic solutions are calculated as the convolution of the free-space Green's function with a surface density; this surface density is itself the solution to an integral equation which has an analytic solution when the boundary values are given as a Chebyshev expansion. Properties of Chebyshev approximations insure that the basis of exterior harmonic functions represents the external near-boundary solutions uniformly. The method is tested by calculating the electrostatic potential resulting from charge distributions in a rectangle. The resulting influence matrix is well-conditioned and solutions converge exponentially as the resolution is increased. The generalization of this approach to three-dimensional problems is discussed, in particular the magnetohydrodynamic equations in a finite cylindrical domain surrounded by a vacuum.

An analytic expression is derived from the Green's function formalism, that reproduces well the asymptotic surface plasmon polariton (SPP) wave as well as the transient surface wave in the near-zone close to the groove. The agreement between this model and the full simulation is very good, showing that the transient \"near-zone\" regime does not depend on the precise shape of the groove. Finally, it is shown that a composite diffractive evanescent wave model that includes the asymptotic SPP can describe the wavelength evolution in this transient near-zone.

The parameter space of astrometric searches gives greater sensitivity to planets at large radii than radial velocity searches. For the VLBA and the expanded VLBA, the targets of radio astrometric surveys are by necessity nearby, low-mass, active stars, which cannot be studied efficiently through the radial velocity method, coronagraphy, or optical interferometry. For the SKA, detection sensitivity will extend to solar-type stars. Planets discovered through radio astrometric methods will be suitable for characterization through extreme adaptive optics.

While the orbital products of a complete basis are linearly dependent, the HF ground state energy can only be obtained via a basis set xOEP scheme in the special case that all products of occupied and unoccupied orbitals emerging from the employed orbital basis set are linearly independent from each other. In this case, however, exchange potentials leading to the HF ground state energy exhibit unphysical oscillations and do not represent a Kohn-Sham (KS) exchange potential. These findings solve the seemingly paradoxical results of Staroverov, Scuseria and Davidson that certain finite basis set xOEP calculations lead to the HF ground state energy despite the fact that within a real space (or complete basis) representation the xOEP ground state energy is always higher than the HF energy. Moreover, whether or not the occupied and unoccupied orbital products are linearly independent, it is shown that basis set xOEP methods only represent exact exchange-only (EXX) KS methods, i.e., proper density-functional methods, if the orbital basis set and the auxiliary basis set representing the exchange potential are balanced to each other, i.e., if the orbital basis is comprehensive enough for a given auxiliary basis.

From the astrometric registration of the X-ray image, C12 was at R.A.=03h:46m:48.43s, decl.=+68d05m47.45s, and was closer to the nucleus than C13. Thus we concluded that source was not an ULX and must instead be associated with the nucleus. The fainter source C13, with L(0.08-10keV)=(5.1\\pm1.4) x 10^{37}ergs^-1 was consistent with a point source and located $6.51'' at P.A. 240 degree of C12.   We also analyzed astrometrically corrected optical Hubble Space Telescope and radio Very Large Array images, a comparison with the X-ray image showed similarities in their morphologies. Regions of star formation within the central region of IC342 were clearly visible in HST H alpha image and this was the region where 3 optical star clusters and correspondingly our detected X-ray source C12 were observed. We found that a predicted X-ray emission from starburst was very close to the observed X-ray luminosity of C12, suggesting that nuclear X-ray emission in IC342 was dominated by starburst. Furthermore, we discussed the possibility of AGN in the nucleus of IC342. Although our data was not enough to give a firm existence of an AGN, it could not be discarded. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

We employed a novel protocol, where one photon is prepared in a superposition of two distinct temporal modes, while the other photon serves as a witness. By performing joint measurements on the two photons using ultrafast detectors, we observed a significant enhancement of entanglement, even when the photons were separated by macroscopic distances and had no prior interaction. Our results provide strong evidence for the existence of quantum non-locality in the realm of time and have profound implications for our understanding of fundamental laws governing physical reality.", "human_text": "  A quantum system composed of two or more subsystems can be in an entangled state, i.e. a state in which the properties of the global system are well defined but the properties of each subsystem are not. Entanglement is at the heart of quantum physics, both for its conceptual foundations and for applications in information processing and quantum communication. Remarkably, entanglement can be \"swapped\": if one prepares two independent entangled pairs A1-A2 and B1-B2, a joint measurement on A1 and B1 (called a \"Bell-State Measurement\", BSM) has the effect of projecting A2 and B2 onto an entangled state, although these two particles have never interacted or shared any common past[1,2]. Experiments using twin photons produced by spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) have already demonstrated entanglement swapping[3-6], but here we present its first realization using continuous wave (CW) sources, as originally proposed[2]. The challenge was to achieve sufficiently sharp synchronization of the photons in the BSM. Using narrow-band filters, the coherence time of the photons that undergo the BSM is significantly increased, exceeding the temporal resolution of the detectors. Hence pulsed sources can be replaced by CW sources, which do not require any synchronization[6,7], allowing for the first time the use of completely autonomous sources. Our experiment exploits recent progress in the time precision of photon detectors, in the efficiency of photon pair production by SPDC with waveguides in nonlinear crystals[8], and in the stability of narrow-band filters. This approach is independent of the form of entanglement; we employed time-bin entangled photons[9] at telecom wavelengths.

At low redshift (z=0.4), we find that 90% of the clusters found have galaxy membership dominated by a single, real-space halo, and that 10% are blended systems for which no single halo contributes a majority of a cluster's membership. At z=1, the fraction of blends increases to 22%, as weaker redshift evolution in observed color extends the comoving length probed by a fixed range of color. Other factors contributing to the increased blending at high-z include broadening of the red sequence and confusion from a larger number of intermediate mass halos hosting bright red galaxies of magnitude similar to those in higher mass halos. Our method produces catalogs of cluster candidates whose halo mass selection function, p(M|\\Ngal,z), is characterized by a bimodal log-normal model with a dominant component that reproduces well the real-space distribution, and a redshift-dependent tail that is broader and displaced by a factor ~2 lower in mass.

In a previous paper we showed that RPT successfully predicts the damping of acoustic oscillations; here we extend our calculation to the enhancement of power due to mode-coupling. We show that mode-coupling generates additional oscillations that are out of phase with those in the linear spectrum, leading to shifts in the scales of oscillation nodes defined with respect to a smooth spectrum. When Fourier transformed, these out of phase oscillations induce percent-level shifts in the acoustic peak of the two-point correlation function. We present predictions for these shifts as a function of redshift; these should be considered as a robust lower limit to the more realistic case that includes in addition redshift distortions and galaxy bias. We show that these nonlinear effects occur at very large scales, leading to a breakdown of linear theory at scales much larger than commonly thought. We discuss why virialized halo profiles are not responsible for these effects, which can be understood from basic physics of gravitational instability.

A compressive wave is set up in a constant sub-Jeans density distribution of radius r = 1 pc. As the wave travels through the simulation grid, a shock-bounded spherical shell is formed. The inner shock of this shell reaches and bounces off the center, leaving behind a central core with an initially almost uniform density distribution, surrounded by an envelope consisting of the material in the shock-bounded shell, with a power-law density profile that at late times approaches a logarithmic slope of -2 even in non-collapsing cases. The resulting density structure resembles a quiescent core of radius < 0.1 pc, with a Bonnor-Ebert-like (BE-like) profile, although it has significant dynamical differences: it is initially non-self-gravitating and confined by the ram pressure of the infalling material, and consequently, growing continuously in mass and size. With the appropriate parameters, the core mass eventually reaches an effective Jeans mass, at which time the core begins to collapse. Thus, there is necessarily a time delay between the appearance of the core and the onset of its collapse, but this is not due to the dissipation of its internal turbulence as it is often believed. These results suggest that pre-stellar cores may approximate Bonnor-Ebert structures which are however of variable mass and may or may not experience gravitational collapse, in qualitative agreement with the large observed frequency of cores with BE-like profiles.

Utilizing archival data from Swift, we re-analyzed the GRB's lightcurve, revealing a complex profile with multiple emission episodes.

Although no X-ray or optical/IR afterglow was discovered to deep limits, the error circle of the GRB (as derived from the Swift BAT) is unusual incontaining the relatively local starburst galaxy IC328. This makes GRB 050906 a candidate burst from a soft-gamma repeater, similar to the giant flare from SGR 1806-20. The probability of chance alignment of a given BAT position with such a galaxy is small (<1%), although the size of the error circle (2.6 arcminute radius) is such that a higher-z origin can't be ruled out. Indeed, the error circle also includes a moderately rich galaxy cluster at z=0.43, which is a plausible location for the burst given the apparent preference that short GRBs have for regions of high mass density. No residual optical or infrared emission has been observed, either in the form of an afterglow or later time emission from any associated supernova-like event. We discuss the constraints these limits place on the progenitor of GRB 050906 based on the expected optical signatures from both SGRs and merging compact object systems. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

The analogy enables one to introduce all the powerful tools of relativistic QED (albeit in a greatly simplified form). The Feynman diagrams and the propagators turn out to be very useful.

To illustrate the usefulness of these methods, we calculate the polarizability and susceptibility up to the fourth order of perturbation theory.

The detrending of the light curves are based on Fourier filtering or a discrete wavelet transformation. TRUFAS requires the presence of at least 3 transit events in the data. Results: The proposed algorithm is shown to identify reliably and quickly the transits that had been included in a standard set of 999 light curves that simulate CoRoT data. Variations in the pre-processing of the light curves and in the selection of the scale of the wavelet transform have only little effect on TRUFAS' results.

Our analysis reveals that while the latter can satisfactorily explain certain aspects of LS I +61 303's behaviour, it struggles to account for its distinctive gamma-ray spectra.

The nature of the compact object and the origin of the high-energy emission are unclear. One family of models invokes particle acceleration in shocks from the collision between the B-star wind and a relativistic pulsar wind, while another centers on a relativistic jet powered by accretion. Recent high-resolution radio observations showing a putative \"cometary tail\" pointing away from the Be star near periastron have been cited as support for the pulsar-wind model. We wish here to carry out a quantitative assessment of these competing models for this extraordinary source. We apply a 3D SPH code for dynamical simulations of both the pulsar-wind-interaction and accretion-jet models. The former yields a description of the shape of the wind-wind interaction surface. The latter provides an estimation of the accretion rate. The results allow critical evaluation of how the two distinct models confront the data in various wavebands under a range of conditions. When one accounts for the 3D dynamical wind interaction under realistic constraints for the relative strength of the B-star and pulsar winds, the resulting form of the interaction front does not match the putative \"cometary tail\" claimed from radio observations. On the other hand, dynamical simulations of the accretion-jet model indicate that the orbital phase variation of accretion power includes a secondary broad peak well away from periastron, thus providing a plausible way to explain the observed TeV gamma ray emission toward apastron. We conclude that the colliding-wind model is not clearly established for LS I +61 303, while the accretion-jet model can reproduce many key characteristics of the observed TeV gamma-ray emission.

The energy of the fundamental harmonic of the cyclotron resonance absorption line near the maximum of the X-ray flux from the source (luminosity range 5x10^{37} - 2x10^{38} erg/s) is ~11 keV. When the pulsar luminosity falls below ~5x10^{37} erg/s, the energy of the fundamental harmonic is displaced sharply toward the high energies, up to ~16 keV. Under the assumption of a dipole magnetic field configuration, this change in cyclotron harmonic energy corresponds to a decrease in the height of the emitting region by ~2 km, while other spectral parameters, in particular, the cutoff energy, remain essentially constant. At a luminosity ~7x10^{37} erg/s, four almost equidistant cyclotron line harmonics are clearly seen in the spectrum. This suggests that either the region where the emission originates is compact or the emergent spectrum from different (in height) segments of the accretion column is uniform.

Our simulations show that 802.11 networks with random topologies operated with AODV routing can only achieve throughputs far below the upper bounds. Fortunately, by properly selecting routes near the gateway (or by properly positioning the relay nodes leading to the gateway) to fashion after the structure of canonical networks, the throughput can be improved significantly by more than 150%.

Our methodology involves analyzing the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of galaxies within the 2MASS survey to determine their evolutionary stages. We then employ a Bayesian framework to quantify the probability distribution of the optimal window, taking into account various sources of uncertainty.

For this constraint to be as tight as possible, it is necessary to maximize the correlation between the two dipoles. This can be achieved by optimizing the survey window through which the flux dipole is measured. Here we explicitly construct such a window for the 2MASS survey. The optimization in essence reduces to excluding from the calculation of the flux dipole galaxies brighter than some limiting magnitude K_min of the near-infrared K_s band. This exclusion mitigates nonlinear effects and shot noise from small scales, which decorrelate the 2MASS dipole from the CMB dipole. Under the assumption of negligible shot noise we find that the optimal value of K_min is about five. Inclusion of shot noise shifts the optimal K_min to larger values. We present an analytical formula for shot noise for the 2MASS flux dipole, to be used in follow-up work with 2MASS data.   The misalignment angle between the two dipoles is a sensitive measure of their correlation: the higher the correlation, the smaller the expectation value of the angle. A minimum of the misalignment is thus a sign of the optimal gravity window. We model analytically the distribution function for the misalignment angle and show that the misalignment estimated by Maller et al. is consistent with the assumed underlying model (though it is greater than the expectation value). We predict with about 90% confidence that the misalignment will decrease if 2MASS galaxies brighter than K_min = 5 mag are excluded from the calculation of the flux dipole.

The results obtained demonstrate the power and flexibility of our approach in handling complex geometric structures, shedding light on long-standing questions in algebraic geometry and complex analysis.", "human_text": "  This is a sequel to [Ca01]=math.AG/0110051. We define the bimeromorphic {\\it category} of geometric orbifolds. These interpolate between (compact K\\\" ahler) manifolds and such manifolds with logarithmic structure. These geometric orbifolds are considered from the point of view of their geometry, and thus equipped with the usual invariants of varieties: morphisms and bimeromorphic maps, differential forms, fundamental groups and universal covers, fields of definition and rational points. The most elementary properties, directly adapted from the case of varieties without orbifold structure, are established here. The arguments of [Ca01] can then be directly adapted to extend the main structure results to this orbifold category. We hope to come back to deeper aspects later. The motivation is that the natural frame for the theory of classification of compact K\\\" ahler (and complex projective) manifolds includes at least the category of orbifolds, as shown in [Ca01] by the fonctorial decomposition of {\\it special} manifolds as tower of orbifolds with either $\\kappa_+=-\\infty$ or $\\kappa=0$, and also, seemingly, by the minimal model program, in which most proofs work only after the adjunction of a \"boundary\".   Also, fibrations enjoy in the bimeromorphic category of geometric orbifolds extension properties not satisfied in the category of varieties without orbifold structure, permitting to express invariants of the total space from those of the generic fibre and of the base. For example, the natural sequence of fundamental groups is exact there; also the total space is special if so are the generic fibre and the base. This makes this category suitable to lift properties from orbifolds having either $\\kappa_+=-\\infty$ or $\\kappa=0$ to those which are special. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

We first show how system-size stochastic resonance arises naturally in this framework, and then how the phenomenon of array-enhanced stochastic resonance can be further enhanced by letting the diffusion coefficient depend on the field. A yet less trivial generalization is exemplified by a stylized version of the FitzHugh-Nagumo system, a paradigm of the activator-inhibitor class. After discussing for this system the second aspect enumerated above, we derive from it -through an adiabatic-like elimination of the inhibitor field- an effective scalar model that includes a nonlocal contribution.

Mid-infrared through X-ray composite BAL quasar SEDs are presented, incorporating all of the available photometry. Overall, we find no compelling evidence for inherent differences between the SEDs of BAL vs. non-BAL quasars of comparable luminosity. Therefore a ``cocoon'' picture of a typical BAL quasar outflow whereby the wind covers a large fraction of the sky is not supported by the mid-infrared SED comparison with normal quasars, and the disk-wind paradigm with a typical radio-quiet quasar hosting a BAL region remains viable.

The inter-nuclear potential energy term converges if zero point vibrations are incorporated and this method can replace the Ewald sum method. Core energy contributions to the ordering energy are stored exclusively in superlattice lines. The effect of electron-phonon interactions on ordering energy is of the same order of magnitude as ordering energy near transition temperatures and cannot be ignored. Ising model and variants are incorrect in explaining alloy phase transitions as they ignore the role of electron-phonon interactions without justification. A theoretical formalism that incorporates the Debye-Waller Factor component of electron-phonon interactions in electronic structure calculations already exists and must be adopted when modeling temperature dependent phenomena. It is suggested that DWF correction will account substantially for the discrepancy between experimental and theoretical ordering energy in Ni3V. Thermal vibrations alter magnetic ordering energy at finite temperatures. The role of electron-phonon interactions in alloy and magnetic phase transitions cannot be ignored and must be incorporated in all models. This will also ensure consistency with x-ray and electron diffraction (alloy transitions) and neutron diffraction (magnetic transitions) results. An isotope effect is predicted for (magnetic) phase transitions if the transition temperature is below Debye temperature. Recent observations of an isotope effect in magnetic phase transitions confirm our above conclusions and imply that the role of electron-phonon interactions must be incorporated in all theories and models of magnetism to avoid contradictions.

The extinction profile of this shadow matches the profile derived from 2MASS photometry at the outer edges of the globule and reaches a maximum of ~32 visual magnitudes at the center. The corresponding mass of CB190 is ~10 Msun. Our 12CO and 13CO J = 2-1 data over a 10 arcmin X 10 arcmin region centered on the shadow show a temperature ~10 K. The thermal continuum indicates a similar temperature for the dust. The molecular data also show evidence of freezeout onto dust grains.

Bonnor-Ebert fits to the density profile, in conjunction with this distance, yield xi_max = 7.2, indicating that CB190 may be unstable. The high temperature (56 K) of the best fit Bonnor-Ebert model is in contradiction with the CO and thermal continuum data, leading to the conclusion that the thermal pressure is not enough to prevent free-fall collapse. We also find that the turbulence in the cloud is inadequate to support it. However, the cloud may be supported by the magnetic field, if this field is at the average level for dark globules. Since the magnetic field will eventually leak out through ambipolar diffusion, it is likely that CB190 is collapsing or in a late pre-collapse stage. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

The inverse techniques considered here are the asymptotic regularization, the Jacobi, Steepest Descent, Newton-Raphson, Landweber-Fridman, and both linear and non-linear Krylov methods based on Fletcher-Reeves, Polak-Ribiere, and Hestenes-Stiefel Conjugate Gradients.

A novel numerical Krylov scheme is shown to be superior in terms of performance and fidelity.

We show that introducing black hole-induced corrections can provide a solution to this problem by generating an effective cutoff scale, thereby reducing the quadratic divergence contributions to the scalar masses. Our results demonstrate that the incorporation of black hole effects leads to a more natural realization of electroweak symmetry breaking within theories with extended Large N species, offering new avenues for addressing the Hierarchy Problem in these frameworks.", "human_text": "  We provide the perturbative and non-perturbative arguments showing that theories with large number of species of the quantum fields, imply an inevitable hierarchy between the masses of the species and the Planck scale, shedding a different light on the hierarchy problem.

An useful byproduct of this proof is that any exactly conserved quantum charge, not associated with a long-range classical field, must be defined maximum modulo N, bounded by the the ratio of the Planck to the unit charge masses squared. For example, a continuous global U(1) `baryon number' symmetry, must be explicitly broken by gravity, at least down to a Z_N subgroup, with N bounded by the ratio of the Planck to baryon masses squared. The same constraint applies to any discrete gauge symmetry, as well as to other quantum-mechanically detectable black hole charges that are associated with the massive quantum hair of the black hole.

The potential possesses valleys of minima with classical inclination, which can be used as inflationary paths. The model is consistent with the fitting of the three-year Wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe data by the standard power-law cosmological model with cold dark matter and a cosmological constant. In particular, the spectral index turns out to be adequately small so that it is compatible with the data. Moreover, the Pati-Salam gauge group is broken to the standard model gauge group during inflation and, thus, no monopoles are formed at the end of inflation. Supergravity corrections based on a non-minimal Kaehler potential with a convenient choice of a sign keep the spectral index comfortably within the allowed range without generating maxima and minima of the potential on the inflationary path.

The eclipses observed in HS 0129+2933, HS 0220+0603, and HS 0455+8315 provided very accurate orbital periods of 3.35129827(65), 3.58098501(34), and 3.56937674(26) h, respectively. HS 0805+3822 shows grazing eclipses and has a likely orbital period of 3.2169(2) h. Time-resolved optical spectroscopy of the new CVs (with the exception of HS 0805+3822) is also presented. Radial velocity studies provided an orbital period of 3.55 h for HS 1813+6122, which allowed us to identify the observed photometric signal at 3.39 h as a negative superhump wave. The spectroscopic behaviour clearly identifies these new CVs as new SW Sextantis stars. These new additions increase the number of known SW Sex stars to 35. Almost 40 per cent of the total SW Sex population do not show eclipses, invalidating the requirement of eclipses as a defining characteristic of the class and the models based on a high orbital inclination geometry alone. On the other hand, the predominance of orbital periods in the narrow 3-4.5 h range is becoming more pronounced. In fact, almost half the CVs which populate the 3-4.5 h period interval are definite members of the class. These statistics are confirmed by our results from the Hamburg Quasar Survey CVs. Remarkably, 54 per cent of the Hamburg nova-like variables have been identified as SW Sex stars with orbital periods in the 3-4.5 h range. The observation of this pile-up of systems close to the upper boundary of the period gap is difficult to reconcile with the standard theory of CV evolution, as the SW Sex stars are believed to have the highest mass transfer rates among CVs.

It is found that dispersion is a decreasing function of the concentration of bridges, while the dependence of dispersion on the burning probability is more complex. Our calculations also show a gap in dispersion for very low concentrations of weak links which indicates a dynamic phase transition between unbiased and biased diffusion regimes.

It is shown that this compactification leads to a controlled four-dimensional N=1 effective theory due to the absence of various quantum corrections. Making contact to the underlying topological string theory the D-instanton superpotential is proposed to be related to a specific modular form counting D3, D1, D(-1) degeneracies on the Enriques Calabi-Yau.

This process is dual to the zero-range process (ZRP) in the sense that, while for the ZRP the rate of transfer of a particle only depends on the occupation of the departure site, it only depends on the occupation of the arrival site for the target process. More precisely, duality associates to a given ZRP a unique target process, and vice-versa.

In this work we focus our interest on the situation where the latter measure exhibits a continuous condensation transition at some finite critical density $\\rho_c$, irrespective of the dimensionality. The novelty comes from the case of asymmetric dynamics, where the target process has a nontrivial fluctuating stationary state, whose characteristics depend on the dimensionality. In one dimension, the system remains homogeneous at any finite density. An alternating scenario however prevails in the high-density regime: typical configurations consist of long alternating sequences of highly occupied and less occupied sites. The local density of the latter is equal to $\\rho_c$ and their occupation distribution is critical. In dimension two and above, the asymmetric target process exhibits a phase transition at a threshold density $\\rho_0$ much larger than $\\rho_c$. The system is homogeneous at any density below $\\rho_0$, whereas for higher densities it exhibits an extended condensate elongated along the direction of the mean current, on top of a critical background with density $\\rho_c$.

The problem we aim to solve lies in understanding how MMFs, which appear as bright, rapidly moving features on the surface of sunspots, relate to these U-loops, particularly with regards to their velocity structure. To address this issue, we employ a combination of observational analysis and numerical modeling techniques. We utilize high-resolution magnetograms from the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) onboard the Hinode spacecraft to track the motion of MMFs and infer their associated magnetic field properties. Our results show that the velocities of MMFs are consistent with those predicted by the U-loop model, providing strong support for this theoretical framework.", "human_text": "  Using data recorded by the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) instrument on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), we have traced 123 pairs of opposite magnetic polarity moving magnetic features (MMFs) in three active regions NOAA ARs 8375, 0330 and 9575. At the time of observation, AR 8375 was young, AR 0330 mature, and AR 9575 decaying. The vertical velocity indicates that the elements of MMF pairs with polarity opposite to that of the sunspot support a downflow of around 50-100 m s$^{-1}$. The average Doppler shift difference between negative and positive elements of an MMF pair is about 150 m s$^{-1}$ in AR 8375, 100 m s$^{-1}$ in AR 0330, and 20 m s$^{-1}$ in AR 9575. These observational results are in agreement with the model that MMF pairs are part of a U-loop emanating from the sunspot's magnetic canopy. According to this model the downflow is caused by the Evershed flow returning below the solar surface. For AR 8375, the horizontal velocity of MMFs ranges from 0.1 km s$^{-1}$ to 0.7 km s$^{-1}$, and on average, the velocity of an MMF pair decreases significantly (from 0.6 km s$^{-1}$ to 0.35 km s$^{-1}$) with increasing distance from the MMF's birth place. This result suggests that the change in MMF flow speed does not reflect the radial structure of the moat flow, but rather is intrinsic to the evolution of the MMF pairs. This result is also in agreement with the U-loop model of MMF pairs. We also find that properties of MMF pairs, most strikingly the lifetime, depend on the evolution stages of the parent sunspot. The mean lifetimes of MMF pairs in ARs 9575 and 0330 are 0.7 hours and 1.6 hours, respectively, which is considerably shorter than the 4 hours lifetime previously found for AR 8375.

The gamma-ray, X-ray and UV/optical emission all showed a peak ~75s after the trigger, although the optical and X-ray afterglow components also appear early on - before, or during, the main peak. Spectral evolution was seen throughout the burst, with the prompt emission showing a clear positive correlation between brightness and hardness. The Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of the prompt emission, stretching from 1eV up to 1MeV, is very flat, with a peak in the flux density at ~1keV. The optical-to-X-ray spectra at this time are better fitted by a broken, rather than single, power-law, similar to previous results for X-ray flares. The SED shows spectral hardening as the afterglow evolves with time. This behaviour might be a symptom of self-Comptonisation, although circumstellar densities similar to those found in the cores of molecular clouds would be required. The afterglow also decays too slowly to be accounted for by the standard models. Although the precursor and main emission show different spectral lags, both are consistent with the lag-luminosity correlation for long bursts.

The whole machinery is then applied to constrained variational calculus.

We employ a combination of asteroseismic modeling and hydrodynamical simulations to study the internal structure and rotational properties of massive stars undergoing differential rotation-induced mixing. Our calculations suggest that the two branches of neutron stars may arise from different evolutionary paths, with rapidly rotating stars forming through binary interactions and slowly rotating stars emerging from single-star evolution.

Such a low M_max, due to a kaon condensation in the stellar core, implies collapse of a too massive deleptonized protoneutron star into a black hole. This would naturally explain the lack of a neutron star in the SN1987A remnant. On the other hand, recent evaluation of mass of PSR J0751+1807 gives M_max > 2M_sun. This contradicts the original Bethe-Brown model, but can be reconciled within scenarios proposed in the present Letter. We consider two types of dense matter models with high-density softening, due to a transition from a non-strange N-phase of matter to a strangeness carrying phase S: kaon condensation and deconfinement of quarks. Two scenarios of neutron star formation in stellar core collapse are considered. In the first scenario, realized in sufficiently hot and dense supernova cores, nucleation of an S-phase is sufficiently rapid so as to form an S-phase core, and implying M_max = M^S_max =~ 1.5M_sun. In the second scenario, nucleation of the S-phase at neutron star birth is too slow to materialize, and the star becomes cold without forming an S-phase core. Then, stellar mass can increase via accretion, until central density \\rho_crit is reached, and the S phase forms. This N branch of neutron stars ends at M=M_crit. We select several models of N-phase satifying the necessary condition M^N_max > 2M_sun and combine them with models of kaon condensation and quark deconfinement. For kaon condensation, we get M_crit =~ M^S_max =~ 1.5M_sun, which is ruled out by PSR J0751+1807.

Here we assess the validity of this approach and compute the leading term of the effective interaction for large interparticle separation beyond this so-called superposition approximation. As an application, we consider the experimentally relevant case of interface deformations owing to the electrostatic field emanating from charged colloidal particles. In mechanical isolation, i.e., if the net force acting on the total system consisting of the particles plus the interface vanishes, the superposition approximation is actually invalid. The effective capillary interaction is governed by contributions beyond this approximation and turns out to be attractive. For sufficiently small surface charges on the colloids, such that linearization is strictly valid, and at asymptotically large separations, the effective interaction does not overcome the direct electrostatic repulsion between the colloidal particles.

Collisional growth seems possible for rather low collision velocities and particular material strengths. The remnants of collisions with impact parameters that are larger than 50% of the radius of the colliding objects tend to rotate. For small impact parameters, the colliding objects are effectively slowed down without a prominent compaction of the porous structure, which probably increases the possibility for growth.

In the framework of the flux rope catastrophe model for CMEs, the energy may be abruptly released either by an ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) catastrophe, which belongs to a global magnetic topological instability of the system, or by a fast magnetic reconnection across preexisting or rapidly-developing electric current sheets. Both ways of magnetic energy release are thought to be important to CME dynamics. To disentangle their contributions, we construct a flux rope catastrophe model in the corona and solar wind and compare different cases in which we either prohibit or allow magnetic reconnection to take place across rapidly-growing current sheets during the eruption. It is demonstrated that CMEs, even fast ones, can be produced taking the ideal MHD catastrophe as the only process of magnetic energy release. Nevertheless, the eruptive speed can be significantly enhanced after magnetic reconnection sets in. In addition, a smooth transition from slow to fast eruptions is observed when increasing the strength of the background magnetic field, simply because in a stronger field there is more free magnetic energy at the catastrophic point available to be released during an eruption. This suggests that fast and slow CMEs may have an identical driving mechanism. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

The existence of the extra Z' in the energy range accessible to future experiments is motivated by the requirement of adequate suppression of proton decay mediation.

To mitigate this problem, we propose a novel framework that integrates random effects into generalized additive models (GAMs). By allowing for non-linear relationships between predictors and outcomes, our approach captures the nuances of individual heterogeneity, thereby improving model fit and prediction accuracy.

Starting with an examination of the relationship between random effects and fixed effects estimators in the standard unobserved effects model, this article demonstrates through analysis and simulation that the mixed model approach has a ``bias compression'' property under a general model for individual heterogeneity that can mitigate bias due to uncontrolled differences among individuals.

To address this problem, we employ a multi-faceted approach combining observational data analysis, numerical simulations, and theoretical modeling. We utilize high-precision photometry from large telescopes to constrain the sizes and shapes of KBOs, while also conducting detailed numerical simulations to investigate the effects of collisions on their internal structure and composition.

Although robust comparisons between observations and theory require better KBO statistics and more comprehensive calculations, the data are broadly consistent with KBO formation in a massive disk followed by substantial collisional grinding and dynamical ejection. However, there are important problems reconciling the results of coagulation and dynamical calculations. Contrasting our current understanding of the evolution of KBOs and asteroids suggests that additional observational constraints, such as the identification of more dynamical families of KBOs (like the 2003 EL61 family), would provide additional information on the relative roles of collisional grinding and dynamical ejection in the Kuiper Belt. The uncertainties also motivate calculations that combine collisional and dynamical evolution, a `unified' calculation that should give us a better picture of KBO formation and evolution.

Through extensive analysis of magnetometer records from multiple stations worldwide, we demonstrate the efficacy of the IHV Index in identifying statistically significant changes in solar wind dynamics. By employing a robust algorithm to extract and quantify IHV patterns within a large dataset, we establish a reliable method for predicting long-term variations in solar wind speed with considerable accuracy.

The IHV-index for a geomagnetic element is mechanically derived from hourly values as the sum of the unsigned differences between adjacent hours over a seven-hour interval centered on local midnight. The index is derived separately for stations in both hemispheres within six longitude sectors using only local night hours. It is intended as a long-term index. Available data allows derivation of the index back well into the 19th century. On a time scale of a 27-day Bartels rotation, IHV averages for stations with corrected geomagnetic latitude less than 55 degrees are strongly correlated with midlatitude range indices. Assuming a constant calibration of the aa-index we find that observed yearly values of aa before the year 1957 are 2.9 nT too small compared to values calculated from IHV using the regression constants based on 1980-2004. We interpret this discrepancy as an indication that the calibration of the aa index is in error before 1957. There is no such problem with the ap index. Rotation averages of IHV are also strongly correlated with solar wind parameters (BV^2). On a time scale of a year combining the IHV-index and the recently-developed Inter-Diurnal Variability (IDV) index (giving B) allows determination of solar wind speed, V, from 1890-present. Over the ~120-year series, the yearly mean solar wind speed varied from a low of 303 km/s in 1902 to a high value of 545 km/s in 2003.

The velocity structure of the ionized gas is complex and cannot be explained globally by a simple dynamical model. The spectra from the clouds are inconsistent with shock or ``shock + precursor'' ionization models, but they are consistent with photoionization by the quasar nucleus. The best-fit photoionization model requires a low-metallicity (12+log(O/H) < 8.7) two-phase medium, consisting of a matter-bounded diffuse component with a unity filling-factor (N ~ 1 \\cc, T ~ 15000 K), in which are embedded small, dense clouds (N ~ 400 \\cc, T ~ 10^4 K). The high-density clouds are transient and can be re-generated through compressing the diffuse medium by low-speed shocks (V_S \\lesssim 100 \\kms). Our photoionization model gives a total mass for the ionized gas of about 3x10^{10} M_sun, and the total kinetic energy implied by this mass and the observed velocity field is ~2x10^{58} ergs. The fact that luminous EELRs are confined to steep-spectrum radio-loud quasars, yet show no morphological correspondence to the radio jets, suggests that the driving force producing the 4C 37.43 EELR was a roughly spherical blast wave initiated by the production of the jet.

Our work focuses on solving the long-standing challenge of producing stable and physically consistent LANS-alpha solutions at high Reynolds numbers, where turbulence is highly anisotropic and three-dimensional. By systematically analyzing the performance of different numerical implementations and parameterizations within the LANS-alpha framework, we have obtained robust and computationally efficient solutions that enable accurate LES simulations.

This allows sufficient separation of scales to observe a Navier-Stokes (NS) inertial range followed by a 2nd LANS inertial range. The analysis of the third-order structure function scaling supports the predicted l^3 scaling; it corresponds to a k^(-1) scaling of the energy spectrum. The energy spectrum itself shows a different scaling which goes as k^1. This latter spectrum is consistent with the absence of stretching in the sub-filter scales due to the Taylor frozen-in hypothesis employed as a closure in the derivation of LANS. These two scalings are conjectured to coexist in different spatial portions of the flow. The l^3 (E(k) k^(-1)) scaling is subdominant to k^1 in the energy spectrum, but the l^3 scaling is responsible for the direct energy cascade, as no cascade can result from motions with no internal degrees of freedom. We verify the prediction for the size of the LANS attractor resulting from this scaling. From this, we give a methodology either for arriving at grid-independent solutions for LANS, or for obtaining a formulation of a LES optimal in the context of the alpha models. The fully converged grid-independent LANS may not be the best approximation to a direct numerical simulation of the NS equations since the minimum error is a balance between truncation errors and the approximation error due to using LANS instead of the primitive equations. Furthermore, the small-scale behavior of LANS contributes to a reduction of flux at constant energy, leading to a shallower energy spectrum for large alpha. These small-scale features, do not preclude LANS to reproduce correctly the intermittency properties of high Re flow. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

This is one in a series of papers in which we discuss issues involved in deriving accurate 3-He/H abundance ratios from the available measurements. Here we describe the ionization correction we use to convert the 3-He+/H+ abundance, y3+, to the 3-He/H abundance, y3. In principle the nebular ionization structure can significantly influence the y3 derived for individual sources. We find that in general there is insufficient information available to make a detailed ionization correction. Here we make a simple correction and assess its validity. The correction is based on radio recombination line measurements of H+ and 4-He+, together with simple core-halo source models. We use these models to establish criteria that allow us to identify sources that can be accurately corrected for ionization and those that cannot. We argue that this effect cannot be very large for most of the sources in our observational sample. For a wide range of models of nebular ionization structure we find that the ionization correction factor varies from 1 to 1.8. Although large corrections are possible, there would have to be a conspiracy between the density and ionization structure for us to underestimate the ionization correction by a substantial amount.

Using high-resolution, three-dimensional simulations, we model the effects of MRI-driven turbulence on the dynamics of solid particles in a vertically-stratified disk. Our results show that the turbulent eddies can trap and concentrate particles in regions with weak or reversing shear flows, promoting grain growth through collisions. We also find that the particle-scale magnetic fields generated by the MRI-driven turbulence play a crucial role in regulating particle dynamics and preventing their efficient coagulation into larger bodies.

Hydrodynamic drag leads to orbital decay and depletion of the solid material in the disk, with characteristic timescales as short as only a few hundred years for meter-sized objects at 1 AU. In this paper, we suggest a particle retention mechanism which promotes the accumulation of grains and the formation of planetesimals near the water sublimation front or ``snow line.'' This model is based on the assumption that, in the regions most interesting for planet formation, the viscous evolution of the disk is due to turbulence driven by the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) in the surface layers of the disk. The depth to which MRI effectively generates turbulence is a strong function of the grain size and abundance. A sharp increase in the grain-to-gas density ratio across the snow line reduces the column depth of the active layer. As the disk evolves towards a quasi-steady-state, this change in the active layer creates a local maximum in radial distribution of the gas surface density and pressure, causing the gas to rotate at super-Keplerian speed and halting the inward migration of grains. This senario presents a robust process for grain retention which may aid in the formation of proto-gas-giant cores preferentially near the snow line. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

We also find that the simulated halo clouds accelerate and become more massive as they fall toward the disk. The parameter space of the simulated clouds is consistent with all of the observed HVC complexes that have distance constraints, except the Magellanic Stream which is known to have a different origin. We also find that nearly half of these simulated halo clouds would be indistinguishable from lower-velocity gas and that this effect is strongest further from the disk of the galaxy, thus indicating a possible missing population of HVCs. These results indicate that the majority of HVCs are consistent with being infalling, condensed clouds that are a remnant of Galaxy formation. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

To achieve this goal, we have developed a customized observing strategy centered around one-night campaigns, during which dedicated telescopes acquire high-cadence photometric data for selected areas of interest. Our initial data release comprises observations of 19 fields, encompassing multiple stellar populations in various environments, including the Large Magellanic Cloud, Small Magellanic Cloud, and several Galactic star clusters.

This first paper describes the project itself, the acquisition of the data, the dataflow, the spectroscopic analysis and the on-line availability of the fully calibrated and reduced data. We also present the results on the 221 stars observed during the first semester of the project. We used the high-resolution echelle spectrographs HARPS and FEROS in the ESO La Silla Observatory (Chile) to survey known variable stars. Once reduced by the dedicated pipelines, the radial velocities are determined from cross correlation with synthetic template spectra, and the spectral types are determined by an automatic minimum distance matching to synthetic spectra, with traditional manual spectral typing cross-checks. The variability types are determined by manually evaluating the available light curves and the spectroscopy. In the future, a new automatic classifier, currently being developed by members of the VSOP team, based on these spectroscopic data and on the photometric classifier developed for the COROT and Gaia space missions, will be used. We confirm or revise spectral types of 221 variable stars from the GCVS. We identify 26 previously unknown multiple systems, among them several visual binaries with spectroscopic binary individual components. We present new individual results for the multiple systems V349 Vel and BC Gru, for the composite spectrum star V4385 Sgr, for the T-Tauri star V1045 Sco, and for DM Boo which we re-classify as a BY Draconis variable.

While the millimetre continuum at 0.3mm originates mainly from the upper photosphere, the longer wavelengths considered here map the low and middle chromosphere. The effective formation height increases generally with wavelength and also from disk-centre towards the solar limb. The average intensity contribution functions are usually rather broad and in some cases they are even double-peaked as there are contributions from hot shock waves and cool post-shock regions in the model chromosphere. Taking into account the deviations from ionisation equilibrium for hydrogen gives a less strong variation of the electron density and with it of the optical depth. The result is a narrower formation height range. The average brightness temperature increases with wavelength and towards the limb. The relative contrast depends on wavelength in the same way as the average intensity but decreases towards the limb. The dependence of the brightness temperature distribution on wavelength and disk-position can be explained with the differences in formation height and the variation of temperature fluctuations with height in the model atmospheres.

This provides a significant boost to the collapsar model for GRBs, as it may present a viable mechanism to prevent the loss of angular momentum by stellar winds at low metallicity, whilst strong Galactic WR winds may inhibit GRBs occurring at solar metallicities. Furthermore, we discuss recently reported quasi-sinusoidal modulations in the radio lightcurves of SNe 2001ig and 2003bg.

Here we calculate the photon scattering rate profile for a single ultraviolet source. After taking into account previously neglected natural broadening of the resonance line, we find that photons approach the resonance frequency and experience most scatterings at a significantly smaller distance from the source than naively expected r=(dnu/nu_0)(c/H), where dnu=nu-nu_0 is the initial frequency offset, and the discrepancy increases as the initial frequency offset decreases. As a consequence, the scattering rate P(r) drops much faster with increasing distance than the previously assumed 1/r^2 profile. Near the source (r<1Mpc comoving), the scattering rate of photons that redshift into the Ly_alpha resonance converges to P(r) \\propto r^{-7/3}. The scattering rate of Ly_alpha photons produced by splitting of photons that redshift into a higher resonance (Ly_gamma, Ly_delta, etc.) is only weakly affected by the radiative transfer, while the sum of scattering rates of Ly_alpha photons produced from all higher resonances also converges to P(r) \\propto r^{-7/3} near the source.

The discovery of substructure on the minor axis, together with the fact that the light profile between 0.5 < R < 1.3 follows the exponential ``extended disk'', is particularly important in shedding light on the mixed and sometimes conflicting results reported in previous studies. Underlying the substructures lies a faint, metal-poor, smooth and extremely extended halo, reaching out to at least 150 kpc. The smooth halo component in M31 has a profile that can be fit with a Hernquist model of immense scale radius ~55 kpc, almost a factor of 4 larger than theoretical predictions. Alternatively a power-law with exponent -1.91 +/- 0.11 can be fit to the profile. The total luminosity of this structure is similar to that of the halo of the Milky Way. This vast, smooth, underlying halo is reminiscent of a classical monolithic model and completely unexpected from modern galaxy formation models. M33 is also found to have an extended metal-poor halo component, which can be fit with a Hernquist model also of scale radius ~55 kpc.

A host of emission lines are present below 2 keV, confirming previous indications from ASCA, due to H- and He-like O, Mg, and Si.

This is particularly significant in studies of reionization, where the dynamic range is the principal limiting factor. We test our halo-finding and HII bubble-finding algorithms independently against N-body simulations with radiative transfer and obtain excellent agreement.

In both systems, interactions of electrons with either phonons or other electrons or both have been proposed to explain superconductivity. In the high-Tc cuprates, the presence of a Van Hove singularity (VHS) in the density of states near the Fermi level was long ago proposed to enhance the many-body couplings and therefore may play a role in superconductivity. Such a singularity can cause an anisotropic variation in the coupling strength, which may partially explain the so-called nodal-antinodal dichotomy in the cuprates. Here we show that the topology of the graphene band structure at dopings comparable to the GICs is quite similar to that of the cuprates and that the quasiparticle dynamics in graphene have a similar dichotomy. Namely, the electron-phonon coupling is highly anisotropic, diverging near a saddle point in the graphene electronic band structure. These results support the important role of the VHS in layered materials and the possible optimization of Tc by tuning the VHS with respect to the Fermi level. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

Alon, Benjamini, Lubetzky and Sodin studied non-backtracking random walks on regular graphs, and showed that their mixing rate may be up to twice as fast as that of the simple random walk. As an application, they showed that the maximal number of visits to a vertex, made by a non-backtracking random walk of length $n$ on a high-girth $n$-vertex regular expander, is typically $(1+o(1))\\frac{\\log n}{\\log\\log n}$, as in the case of the balls and bins experiment. They further asked whether one can establish the precise distribution of the visits such a walk makes.   In this work, we answer the above question by combining a generalized form of Brun's sieve with some extensions of the ideas in Alon et al. Let $N_t$ denote the number of vertices visited precisely $t$ times by a non-backtracking random walk of length $n$ on a regular $n$-vertex expander of fixed degree and girth $g$. We prove that if $g=\\omega(1)$, then for any fixed $t$, $N_t/n$ is typically $\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{e}t!}+o(1)$. Furthermore, if $g=\\Omega(\\log\\log n)$, then $N_t/n$ is typically $\\frac{1+o(1)}{\\mathrm{e}t!}$ uniformly on all $t \\leq (1-o(1))\\frac{\\log n}{\\log\\log n}$ and 0 for all $t \\geq (1+o(1))\\frac{\\log n}{\\log\\log n}$. In particular, we obtain the above result on the typical maximal number of visits to a single vertex, with an improved threshold window. The essence of the proof lies in showing that variables counting the number of visits to a set of sufficiently distant vertices are asymptotically independent Poisson variables.

Special attention needs to be devoted to the coupling to massless gauge fields (photon, gluon), since it is well known that loop effects may be important for these fields. We also present a detailed explanation of these couplings from the CFT interpretation. We then use these couplings to determine the radion branching fractions and discuss some of the discovery potential of the LHC for the radion. We find that the gamma-gamma signal is enhanced over most of the range of the radion mass over the gamma-gamma signal of a SM Higgs, as long as the RS scale is sufficiently low. However, the signal significance depends strongly on free parameters that characterize the magnitude of bare brane-localized kinetic terms for the massless gauge fields. In the absence of such terms, the signal can be be enhanced over the traditional RS1 models (where all standard model fields are localized on the IR brane), but the signal can also be reduced compared to RS1 if the brane localized terms are sizeable. We also show that for larger radion masses, where the gamma-gamma signal is no longer significant, one can use the usual 4 lepton signal to discover the radion. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

Our results show that these AGN are often located in galaxies experiencing high levels of star-formation activity, suggesting a possible link between AGN fuelling and the triggering of starbursts.

We detect a strong trend for sources that are actively undergoing star-formation to have excess radio emission beyond the ~10^28 ergs/s/Hz level found for sources without any discernible star-formation. Furthermore, this additional radio emission correlates well with the strength of the 4000A break in the optical spectrum, and may be used to assess the age of the star-forming component. We examine two subsamples, one containing the systems with emission line ratios most like star-forming systems, and one with the sources that have characteristic AGN ratios. This division also separates the mechanism responsible for the radio emission (star-formation vs. AGN). For both cases we find a strong, almost identical, correlation between [OIII] and radio luminosity, with the AGN sample extending toward lower, and the star-formation sample toward higher luminosities. A clearer separation between the two subsamples is seen as function of the central velocity dispersion of the host galaxy. For systems with similar redshifts and velocity dispersions, the star-formation subsample is brighter than the AGN in the radio by an order of magnitude. This underlines the notion that the radio emission in star-forming systems can dominate the emission associated with the AGN. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

A low rate would signal new physics, excluding all the 90% allowed range of the standard LMA solution at 3$\\sigma$, and a time variability would be a strong signature of the SFP model. The CNO fluxes are the ones for which the two SSM predictions exhibit the largest differences, so their measurement at SNO+ will be important to favour one or the other.

In the second phase, a set of cooperating nodes acts as a distributed antenna system and beamform the received analog waveform to one or more faraway destinations. This step requires multiplication of the received analog waveform by a complex number, which is independently computed by each cooperating node, and which enables separation of the collided packets based on their final destination.

We employed a modified version of the Box-fitting algorithm for transit detection, taking into account the variable density of the cluster stars. The TESS data enabled us to achieve photometric precision sufficient for detecting transiting planets with radii similar to or smaller than that of Neptune.

Searching for planets in open clusters allows us to study the effects of dynamical environment on planet formation and evolution.   Aims. Considering the strong dependence of planet frequency on stellar metallicity, we studied the metal rich old open cluster NGC 6791 and searched for close-in planets using the transit technique.   Methods. A ten-night observational campaign was performed using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (3.6m), the San Pedro M\\'artir telescope (2.1m), and the Loiano telescope (1.5m). To increase the transit detection probability we also made use of the Bruntt et al. (2003) eight-nights observational campaign. Adequate photometric precision for the detection of planetary transits was achieved.   Results. Should the frequency and properties of close-in planets in NGC 6791 be similar to those orbiting field stars of similar metallicity, then detailed simulations foresee the presence of 2-3 transiting planets. Instead, we do not confirm the transit candidates proposed by Bruntt et al. (2003). The probability that the null detection is simply due to chance coincidence is estimated to be 3%-10%, depending on the metallicity assumed for the cluster.   Conclusions. Possible explanations of the null-detection of transits include: (i) a lower frequency of close-in planets in star clusters; (ii) a smaller planetary radius for planets orbiting super metal rich stars; or (iii) limitations in the basic assumptions. More extensive photometry with 3-4m class telescopes is required to allow conclusive inferences about the frequency of planets in NGC 6791. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

The pair approximation is moreover able to describe two types of coexistence of prey and predators: one where population densities are constant in time and another displaying self-sustained time-oscillations of the population densities. The oscillations are associated with limit cycles and arise through a Hopf bifurcation.

Random motions within the Local Sheet are small. Our Galaxy participates in the bulk motion of the Local Sheet away from the Local Void. The component of our motion on an intermediate scale is attributed to the Virgo Cluster and its surroundings, 17 Mpc away. The third and largest component is an attraction on scales larger than 3000 km/s and centered near the direction of the Centaurus Cluster. The amplitudes of the three components are 259, 185, and 455 km/s, respectively, adding collectively to 631 km/s in the reference frame of the Local Sheet. Taking the nearby influences into account causes the residual attributed to large scales to align with observed concentrations of distant galaxies and reduces somewhat the amplitude of motion attributed to their pull. On small scales, in addition to the motion of our Local Sheet away from the Local Void, the nearest adjacent filament, the Leo Spur, is seen to be moving in a direction that will lead to convergence with our filament. Finally, a good distance to an isolated galaxy within the Local Void reveals that this dwarf system has a motion of at least 230 km/s away from the void center.

Measuring the local concentration of such a protein with a spatially-varying distribution allows the measurement of position within the system.

We focus on gradient proteins with first order reaction kinetics. Systems of this type have been experimentally characterised in both developmental and cell biology settings. For a single gradient we show that, through time-averaging, great precision can potentially be achieved even with very low protein copy numbers. As a second example, we investigate the ability of a system with oppositely directed gradients to find its centre. With this mechanism, positional precision close to the centre improves more slowly with increasing averaging time, and so longer averaging times or higher copy numbers are required for high precision. For both single and double gradients, we demonstrate the existence of optimal length scales for the gradients, where precision is maximized, as well as analyzing how precision depends on the size of the concentration measuring apparatus. Our results provide fundamental constraints on the positional precision supplied by concentration gradients in various contexts, including both in developmental biology and also within a single cell.

The observational simplicity of our approach, and the direct measurements of the black hole predictor quantity, i.e. the Sersic index, for both elliptical galaxies and the bulges of disc galaxies makes it straightforward to estimate accurate black hole masses in early- and late-type galaxies alike.

Considering spheroidal stellar systems brighter than M_B = -18 mag, and integrating down to black hole masses of 10^6 M_sun, we find that the local mass density of supermassive black holes in early-type galaxies rho_{bh, early-type} = (3.5+/-1.2) x 10^5 h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3}, and in late-type galaxies rho_{bh, late-type} = (1.0+/-0.5) x 10^5 h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3}.

We discuss the data-reduction procedures required to attain this accuracy; without these procdures, the calibration factor obtained using the automated pipeline at the Spitzer Science Center is 1.6% +/- 0.6% lower. We extend this work to predict 24 micron flux densities for a sample of 238 stars which covers a larger range of flux densities and spectral types. We present a total of 348 measurements of 141 stars at 24 micron. This sample covers a factor of ~460 in 24 micron flux density, from 8.6 mJy up to 4.0 Jy. We show that the calibration is linear over that range with respect to target flux and background level. The calibration is based on observations made using 3-second exposures; a preliminary analysis shows that the calibration factor may be 1% and 2% lower for 10- and 30-second exposures, respectively. We also demonstrate that the calibration is very stable: over the course of the mission, repeated measurements of our routine calibrator, HD 159330, show a root-mean-square scatter of only 0.4%. Finally, we show that the point spread function (PSF) is well measured and allows us to calibrate extended sources accurately; Infrared Astronomy Satellite (IRAS) and MIPS measurements of a sample of nearby galaxies are identical within the uncertainties.

Thus, the intrinsic features of such machinery are not accessible directly from (known) network properties. Rather, what one can see are the global patterns of its use and, thus, a global view of the power and organization of the underlying grammar. Taking a look into more practical issues, the paper examines how to build a net from the projection of syntactic relations. Recall that, as opposed to adult grammars, early-child language has not a well-defined concept of structure. To overcome such difficulty, we develop a set of systematic criteria assuming constituency hierarchy and a grammar based on lexico-thematic relations. At the end, what we obtain is a well defined corpora annotation that enables us i) to perform statistics on the size of structures and ii) to build a network from syntactic relations over which we can perform the standard measures of complexity.

This emergent supersymmetry paradigm allows us to sidestep traditional constraints on supersymmetric dark matter candidates and explore novel possibilities for addressing the observed relic density. Our results indicate that the resulting dark matter particle can be significantly more massive than typical WIMPs, offering an interesting complement to existing searches and providing a potential window into the underlying theory's structure.", "human_text": "  We investigated the viability of neutralino dark matter in the gauge mediation from emergent supersymmetry proposal.

The lightest supersymmetric partner, in contrast to traditional gauge mediation, is a neutralino which is also a dark matter candidate. By explicit calculation of the low energy spectra, the parameter space was constrained using the WMAP observed relic density of dark matter, LEP2 Higgs mass bounds, collider bounds on supersymmetric partners and exotic B-meson decays.

We first show that the language on a two letter alphabet that naturally encodes culminating paths is not context-free. Then, we focus on the enumeration of culminating paths.

The rejection approach, coupled with a symmetry argument, gives an algorithm that is linear when a>= b, with no precomputation stage nor non-linear storage required. The choice of the best algorithm is not as clear when a<b.

It sheds new light on the age old problem by thinking of the traditional algorithms as working with images. Inspiration is drawn from an analogous situation that is found in machine and human vision. Image processing techniques are used to assist in the spatial indexing of the data. A fixed grid approach is used and bins with too many records are sub-divided hierarchically. Search queries are pre-computed for bins that do not contain any data records. This has the effect of dividing the search space up into non rectangular regions which are based on the spatial properties of the data. The bucketing quad tree can be considered as an image with a resolution of two by two for each layer. The results show that this method performs better than the quad tree if there are more divisions per layer. This confirms our suspicions that the algorithm works better if it gets to look at the data with higher resolution images. An elegant class structure is developed where the implementation of concrete spatial indexes for a particular data type merely relies on rendering the data onto an image. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

The second step consists in writing this graph as a program in Soft Constraint Logic Programming (SCLP): the engine of this framework is then able to find the best paths/trees by optimizing their costs and solving the constraints imposed on them (e.g. delay < 40msec), thus finding a solution to QoS routing problems. Moreover, c-semiring structures are a convenient tool to model QoS metrics.

Increasing the total dissipation (by either decreasing the restitution coefficient or increasing the total number of particles) decreases the increase in granular temperature and rms particle displacement at fluidization, and shifts the increase to higher accelerations. Increasing the frequency also decreases the magnitude of the jump, and shifts the change to lower accelerations. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

Bubbles result from self-reinforcing positive feedbacks. This leads to explore uncharted territories and niches whose rare successes lead to extraordinary discoveries and provide the base for the observed accelerating development of technology and of the economy. But the returns are very heterogeneous, very risky and may not occur. In other words, bubbles, which are characteristic definitions of human activity, allow huge risks to get huge returns over large scales.

A hole in the CO distribution coincides with the nucleus where most of the Halpha emission and blue light are emitted. The kinematics are modelled in three different ways, ranging from the purely geometrical to the most physical. This approach allows us to constrain progressively the physical properties of the galaxy and eventually to emerge with a reasonable fit to an analytical model of orbits in a barred potential. Fitting an axisymmetric model shows that the non-circular motions must be comparable in amplitude to the circular motions (120 km/s). Fitting a model based on elliptical orbits allows us to identify with confidence the single inner Lindblad resonance (ILR) of the large scale bar. Finally, a model based on analytical solutions for the gas particle orbits in a weakly barred potential constrained by the ILR radius reproduces the observations well. The mass inflow rate is then estimated and discussed based on the best fit model solution. The gravitational torques implied by this model are able to efficiently funnel the gas inside the ILR down to 300 pc, although another mechanism must take over to fuel the nuclear starburst inside 100 pc.

In the current work the optical properties have been studied by diffuse reflection spectroscopy in the UV-Vis region and the band gap of the Co doped compositions has been found to decrease with Co addition. Reflections minima are observed at the energies characteristic of Co+2 d-d (tethrahedral symmetry) crystal field transitions, further establishing the presence of Co in substitutional sites.

We find that the outflows tend to escape to low density regions, and hardly affect the dense filaments visible in HI absorption. As a result, the strength of HI absorption near galaxies is not reduced by galactic winds, but even slightly increases. We also find that a lack of HI absorption for lines of sight (LOS) close to galaxies, as found by Adelberger et al., can be created by hot gas around the galaxies induced by accretion shock heating. In contrast to HI, metal absorption systems are sensitive to the presence of winds. The models without feedback can produce the strong CIV and OVI absorption lines in LOS within 50 kpc from galaxies, while strong SN feedback is capable of creating strong CIV and OVI lines out to about twice that distance. We also analyze the mean transmissivity of HI, CIV, and OVI within 1 h$^{-1}$ Mpc from star-forming galaxies. The probability distribution of the transmissivity of HI is independent of the strength of SN feedback, but strong feedback produces LOS with lower transmissivity of metal lines. Additionally, strong feedback can produce strong OVI lines even in cases where HI absorption is weak. We conclude that OVI is probably the best tracer for galactic winds at high redshift.

The behaviors of both A and B phases may be studied by mapping the ground state sector into a general p-wave paired states of spinless fermions with tunable pairing parameters on a square lattice. In this p-wave paired state theory, the A phase is shown to be the strong paired phase, an insulating phase. The B phase may be either gapped or gapless determined by the generalized inversion symmetry is broken or not. The gapped B is the weak pairing phase described by either the Moore-Read Pfaffian state of the spinless fermions or anti-Pfaffian state of holes depending on the sign of the next nearest neighbor hopping amplitude. A phase transition between Pfaffian and anti-Pfaffian states are found in the gapped B phase. Furthermore, we show that there is a hidden SU(2) gauge symmetry in our model.

Our results reveal a diverse range of morphological features among LCGs, including central brightness enhancements, faint outer envelopes, and striking tidal tails, indicative of recent mergers or intense starbursts. By dissecting these complex morphologies, we gain insights into the dynamic interplay between internal star formation processes and external influences, such as galaxy interactions and environmental conditions, thereby refining our understanding of LCGs and their place within the broader context of galaxy evolution.", "human_text": "  (Abridged) Luminous Compact Galaxies (LCGs) (M_B < -20, R_{1/2} < 4.5kpc and EW_{0}(OII) >15\\AA) constitute one of the most rapidly evolving galaxy populations over the last ~8 Gyr history of the universe. Due to their inherently compact sizes, any detailed quantitative analysis of their morphologies has proved to be difficult in the past. In this work we use the high angular resolution imaging data, from the HST/ACS GOODS survey, to study the quantitative morphology of a complete sample of LCGs in the redshift range 0.5 < z < 1.2. We have derived structural parameters for a representative sample of 39 LCGs selected from the GOODS-S field, using full 2-dimensional surface brightness profile fitting of the galaxy images in each of the four filters available. B-z color maps are used as an aid in the morphological classification. We then use the rest frame B band bulge flux fraction (B/T) to determine the morphological class of the galaxies. Mergers were essentially identified visually by the presence of multiple maxima of comparable intensity in the rest frame B band images, aided by the color maps to distinguish them from HII regions. We derive the following morphological mix for our sample of intermediate redshift LCGs: Mergers: ~36%, Disk dominated: ~22%, S0: ~20%, Early types: ~7%, Irr/tadpole: ~15%. We establish that our sample LCGs are intermediate mass objects with a median stellar mass of Log(M/M_{\\odot})=10.32. We also derive dust enshrouded SFR values ranging from a few to ~65 $M_{\\odot}$/year using Spitzer 24$\\mu m$ data. We estimate a factor ~11 fall in the comoving number density of blue LCGs from redshifts 0.5 < z < 1.2 to the current epoch. We finally discuss the evolutionary scenario of these LCGs which might give us some clues regarding their descendants in the local universe. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

We sought to develop a mathematical approach to this problem using, as a test case, one of the most well-studied and clinically important signaling networks in biology today, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) driven signaling cascade. More specifically, we suggest a method, augmented sparse reconstruction, for the identification of links among nodes of ordinary differential equation (ODE) networks from a small set of trajectories with different initial conditions. Our method builds a system of representation by using a collection of integrals of all given trajectories and by attenuating block of terms in the representation itself. The system of representation is then augmented with random vectors, and minimization of the 1-norm is used to find sparse representations for the dynamical interactions of each node. Augmentation by random vectors is crucial, since sparsity alone is not able to handle the large error-in-variables in the representation. Augmented sparse reconstruction allows to consider potentially very large spaces of models and it is able to detect with high accuracy the few relevant links among nodes, even when moderate noise is added to the measured trajectories. After showing the performance of our method on a model of the EGFR protein network, we sketch briefly the potential future therapeutic applications of this approach. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

We find that the waiting times between avalanches are fully uncorrelated, as the wavelet transform of their autocorrelations scales as white noise. Similarly, detrended size-size correlations give a white-noise wavelet transform. Consideration of finite driving rates, still deep within the intermittent regime, shows the wavelet transform of correlations scaling as $1/f^{1.5}$ for intermediate frequencies.

These results provide new insights into the formation and evolution of Population III stars, and highlight the importance of magnetic processes in shaping their final stages of evolution.", "human_text": "  We perform a series of two-dimensional magnetorotational core-collapse simulations of Pop III stars. Changing the initial distributions of rotation and magnetic fields prior to collapse in a parametric manner, we compute 19 models. By so doing, we systematically investigate how rotation and magnetic fields affect the collapse dynamics and explore how the properties of the black-hole formations and neutrino emissions could be affected. As for the microphysics, we employ a realistic equation of state and approximate the neutrino transfer by a multiflavour leakage scheme. With these computations, we find that the jet-like explosions are obtained by the magnetodriven shock waves if the initial magnetic field is as large as $10^{12}$ G. We point out that the black-hole masses at the formation decrease with the initial field strength, on the other hand, increase with the initial rotation rates. As for the neutrino properties, we point out that the degree of the differential rotation plays an important role to determine which species of the neutrino luminosity is more dominant than the others. Furthermore, we find that the stronger magnetic fields make the peak neutrino luminosities smaller, because the magnetic pressure acts to halt the collapse in the central regions, leading to the suppression of the releasable gravitational binding energies.

We attempt to solve the problem of determining the computational complexity of model checking HFL, a long-standing open question in the field. Our work relies on a novel reduction from the satisfiability problem for first-order logic to model checking HFL, which allows us to leverage known lower bounds for the former problem. By establishing that model checking HFL is PSPACE-hard, we provide the first upper bound on its complexity and shed new light on the decidability of this important logical framework.", "human_text": "  Higher-Order Fixpoint Logic (HFL) is a hybrid of the simply typed \\lambda-calculus and the modal \\lambda-calculus. This makes it a highly expressive temporal logic that is capable of expressing various interesting correctness properties of programs that are not expressible in the modal \\lambda-calculus.   This paper provides complexity results for its model checking problem. In particular we consider those fragments of HFL built by using only types of bounded order k and arity m. We establish k-fold exponential time completeness for model checking each such fragment. For the upper bound we use fixpoint elimination to obtain reachability games that are singly-exponential in the size of the formula and k-fold exponential in the size of the underlying transition system. These games can be solved in deterministic linear time. As a simple consequence, we obtain an exponential time upper bound on the expression complexity of each such fragment.   The lower bound is established by a reduction from the word problem for alternating (k-1)-fold exponential space bounded Turing Machines. Since there are fixed machines of that type whose word problems are already hard with respect to k-fold exponential time, we obtain, as a corollary, k-fold exponential time completeness for the data complexity of our fragments of HFL, provided m exceeds 3. This also yields a hierarchy result in expressive power. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

Measurements of cosmic ray antiparticles, such as positrons, can impose strong constraints on the nature of new physics beyond the Standard Model. However, cosmic ray positron measurements are experimentally very challenging due to the vast proton background. A novel approach of positron identification with the space-borne AMS-01 experiment, namely through the detection of bremsstrahlung conversion in a silicon microstrip detector, is introduced. Bremsstrahlung from protons is suppressed by a factor of more than 3*10^6 with respect to positrons. The results of the positron measurement show that the bremsstrahlung approach extends the sensitivity range of AMS-01 to positron momenta up to 50 GeV/c, which is far beyond the original scope of the experiment. At momenta above 8 GeV/c there is indication for a positron overabundance with respect to model predictions for purely secondary positron production. Therefore, the AMS-01 data lend further weight to the hints of a positron overabundance seen in the data from earlier experiments.   The positron fraction measurements from the most recent experiments are combined with the results of this analysis, giving the most precise positron fraction data yet available.

For general networks, if information-generation rates are fixed, the new routing problem is formulated as a linear programming problem; otherwise, the cost for routing is dynamically adjusted according to the amount of energy remaining and the effectiveness of CB/CT.

We identify several young stellar clusters and determine their ages using colour-magnitude diagrams. The HI synthesis observations reveal an extensive, low-surface-brightness neutral gas disk surrounding the galaxy, which we map in detail. By combining these data sets, we investigate the relationship between the galaxy's stellar and gaseous components, including the spatial distribution of star formation, gas density and metallicity gradients, and the impact of tidal interactions on the system.

The optical morphology characteristically shows a bar-like main body with a one-sided spiral arm, an approximately exponential light distribution, and offset photometric and kinematic centers. The HI distribution is mildly asymmetric and, although slightly offset from the photometric center, roughly follows the optical brightness distribution, extending to over 1.2 Holmberg radii (where mu_B = 26.5 mag/arcsec^2). In particular, the highest HI column densities closely follow the bar, one-arm spiral, and a third optical extension. The rotation is solid-body in the inner parts but flattens outside of the optical extent. The total HI flux F_HI = 23.1 pm 1.2 Jy km/s, yielding a total HI mass M_HI= (6.4 pm 1.7) x 10^8 Msun (for a distance D = 10.8 pm 1.4 Mpc) and a total HI mass-to-blue-luminosity ratio M_HI/L_B = (0.96 pm 0.14) Msun / Lsun,B (distance independent). The HI data suggest a very complex small-scale HI structure, with evidence of large shells and/or holes, but deeper observations are required for a detailed study. Follow-up observations are also desirable for a proper comparison with the Large Magellanic Cloud, where despite an optical morphology very similar to ESO 364-G 029 the HI bears little resemblance to the optical.

By observing the pulse profiles of a sample of southern hemisphere pulsars using the Parkes Radio Telescope at 92 cm, we detect significant subpulse modulation in several sources, characterized by changes in pulse intensity and shape. Our results indicate that subpulse modulation is more pronounced at lower frequencies, suggesting an intrinsic connection between the emission process and the observed frequency range.

In this paper we present the 92-cm data and a comparison is made with the already published 21-cm results. We analysed 191 pulsars at 92 cm using fluctuation spectra. The sample of pulsars is as unbiased as possible towards any particular pulsar characteristics. For 15 pulsars drifting subpulses are discovered for the first time and 26 of the new drifters found in the 21-cm data are confirmed. We discovered nulling for 8 sources and 8 pulsars are found to intermittently emit single pulses that have pulse energies similar to giant pulses. It is estimated that at least half of the total population of pulsars have drifting subpulses when observations with a high enough signal-to-noise ratio would be available. It could well be that the drifting subpulse mechanism is an intrinsic property of the emission mechanism itself, although for some pulsars it is difficult or impossible to detect. Drifting subpulses are in general found at both frequencies, although the chance of detecting drifting subpulses is possibly slightly higher at 92 cm. It appears that the youngest pulsars have the most disordered subpulses and the subpulses become more and more organized into drifting subpulses as the pulsar ages. The correlations with the modulation indices are argued to be consistent with the picture in which the radio emission can be divided in a drifting subpulse signal plus a quasi-steady signal which becomes, on average, stronger at high observing frequencies. The measured values of P3 at the two frequencies are highly correlated, but there is no evidence for a correlation with other pulsar parameters. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

Unexpectedly, this rule is also equivalent to the Born rule with regard to the explanation of the results of statistical experiments.

Our methodology entailed the design and synthesis of novel MCR peptides with high affinity for RB and the subsequent assessment of their ability to modulate insulin signaling in human lung cancer cells.

Meanwhile, several such MCR peptide variants have been demonstrated to restrain the proliferation of different human cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, one of the MCR peptides coined MCR-10 was shown to be capable of interfering with the complex formation between insulin and RB in HepG2 human hepatoma cells, as monitored by immunofluorescence.

We have shown previously that the top-heavy IMF seems to be necessary to explain the number counts of faint sub-mm galaxies. We compare the model with observational data from the SPITZER Space Telescope, with the model parameters fixed at values chosen before SPITZER data became available. We find that the model matches the observed evolution in the IR remarkably well over the whole range of wavelengths probed by SPITZER. In particular, the SPITZER data show that there is strong evolution in the mid-IR galaxy luminosity function over the redshift range z ~ 0-2, and this is reproduced by our model without requiring any adjustment of parameters.

The 2 sigma upper limit on the period derivative leads, in the dipole spin-down formalism, to an energy loss rate E-dot < 7e33 ergs/s, surface magnetic field strength B_p < 1.5e11 G, and characteristic age tau_c = P/2P-dot > 8 Myr. This tau_c exceeds the age of the SNR by 3 orders of magnitude, implying that the pulsar was born spinning at its current period. However, the X-ray luminosity of PSR J1852+0040, L(bol) ~ 3e33(d/7.1 kpc)^2 ergs/s is a large fraction of E-dot, which challenges the rotation-powered assumption. Instead, its high blackbody temperature, 0.46+/-0.04 keV, small blackbody radius ~ 0.8 km, and large pulsed fraction, ~ 80%, may be evidence of accretion onto a polar cap, possibly from a fallback disk made of supernova debris. If B_p < 1e10 G, an accretion disk can penetrate the light cylinder and interact with the magnetosphere while resulting torques on the neutron star remain within the observed limits. A weak B-field is also inferred in another CCO, the 424-ms pulsar 1E 1207.4-5209, from its steady spin and soft X-ray absorption lines. We propose this origin of radio-quiet CCOs: the B-field, derived from a turbulent dynamo, is weaker if the NS is formed spinning slowly, which enables it to accrete SN debris. Accretion excludes neutron stars born with both B_p < 1e11 G and P > 0.1 s from radio pulsar surveys, where B_p < 1e11 G is not encountered except among very old (tau_c > 40 Myr) or recycled pulsars. Finally, such a CCO, if born in SN 1987A, could explain the non-detection of a pulsar there. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

Our analysis reveals a complex interplay between gas and star formation in this distant galaxy, with a central compact star-forming region surrounded by a larger, diffuse component. We find that the galaxy's mass is dominated by its stars, and that the metallicity of the gas and stars are consistent across different spatial scales.

This is only the second detection of molecular gas emission from an LBG and yields an intrinsic molecular gas mass of (2.4+/-0.4)x10^9 Mo. The lens reconstruction of the UV morphology of the LBG indicates that it comprises two components separated by ~2 kpc. The CO emission is unresolved, and appears to be centered on the intrinsically fainter (and also less highly magnified) of the two UV components. The width of the CO line indicates a dynamical mass of (8+/-2)x10^9csc(i)^2 Mo within the central 2 kpc. Employing mid-infrared observations from Spitzer we derive a stellar mass of ~(6+/-2)x10^9 Mo and a star-formation rate of ~60 Mo/yr, indicating that the molecular gas will be consumed in ~40 Myr. The gas fractions, star-formation efficiencies and line widths suggests that LBGJ213512 is a high-redshift, gas-rich analog of a local luminous infrared galaxy.

To address this issue, we developed a novel approach combining high-resolution spectroscopy and numerical simulations to study the evolution of strong MgII absorbers over time. Our results demonstrate that the kinematic properties of these systems are highly dependent on their physical conditions, with higher column densities and metallicities leading to more ordered motion.

We compare and supplement this sample with 23 strong MgII absorbers at 0.4 < z < 1.4 observed previously with HIRES/Keck. We find that neither equivalent width nor kinematic spread (the optical depth weighted second moment of velocity) of MgII2796 evolve. However, the kinematic spread is sensitive to the highest velocity component, and therefore not as sensitive to additional weak components at intermediate velocities relative to the profile center. The fraction of absorbing pixels within the full velocity range of the system does show a trend of decreasing with decreasing redshift. Most high redshift systems (14/20) exhibit absorption over the entire system velocity range, which differs from the result for low redshift systems (18/36) at the 95% level. This leads to a smaller number of separate subsystems for high redshift systems because weak absorping components tend to connect the stronger regions of absorption. We hypothesize that low redshift MgII profiles are more likely to represent well formed galaxies, many of which have kinematics consistent with a disk/halo structure. High redshift MgII profiles are more likely to show evidence of complex protogalactic structures, with multiple accretion or outflow events. Although these results are derived from measurements of gas kinematics, they are consistent with hierarchical galaxy formation evidenced by deep galaxy surveys. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

As an illustration, the method is applied to driven parametric oscillations of two interacting electrons in a harmonic potential (Hooke's atom).

However, we know, from the observation of structures at increasing scales, that these models are only approximations of a smoothed or averaged inhomogeneous underlying patern. Anyhow, when modelling the Universe, the usual method is to use continuous functions representing the kinematical scalars of the velocity field, implicitly assuming that they represent volume averages of the corresponding fine-scale inhomogeneous quantities, then put them into the Einstein equations which are solved to give the model and its dependance upon a number of parameters arbitrarily defined. In General Relativity, such a method is very much involved since the equations which determine the metric tensor and the quantities calculated from it are highly nonlinear.

Our observations reveal distinct differences between these two tracers, indicating varying conditions within the complex. We employed a combination of single-dish and interferometric data from the Effelsberg 100-m telescope and the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA), respectively. The anomalous H$_2$CO absorption was found to originate from the dense cores surrounding L1204, while the CO(1-0) emission is more extended, likely tracing the larger-scale molecular gas structure.

This spectral line is seen here in absorption against the cosmic microwave background, indicating the presence of widespread warm molecular gas at intermediate densities. Overall, the distributions of H$_2$CO and CO (taken from the literature) are fairly similar, though significant differences exist at small scales. Most notably, while the CO peak is nearly coincident with the S140 H${\\alpha}$ arc, the maximum H$_2$CO absorption is clearly separated from it by a full 10$'$ beam ($\\sim$ 3 pc). We argue that these differences result from differing abundances and excitation requirements. The CO(1-0) line is more optically thick and more biased towards warm gas than the H$_2$CO 6 cm line. On the other hand, formaldehyde is more easily photodissociated and is, therefore, a poorer tracer of the molecular gas located immediately behind Photon Dominated Regions. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

The existence of gravitational radiation was first predicted by Einstein in 1916, however gravitational waves have not yet been directly observed. One source of gravitation radiation is binary inspiral. Two compact bodies orbiting each other, such as a pair of black holes, lose energy to gravitational radiation. As the system loses energy the bodies spiral towards each other. This causes their orbital speed and the amount of gravitational radiation to increase, producing a characteristic ``chirp'' waveform in the LIGO sensitive band. In this thesis, matched filtering of LIGO science data is used to search for low mass binary systems in the halo of dark matter surrounding the Milky Way. Observations of gravitational microlensing events of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud suggest that some fraction of the dark matter in the halo may be in the form of Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). It has been proposed that low mass black holes formed in the early universe may be a component of the MACHO population; some fraction of these black hole MACHOs will be in binary systems and detectable by LIGO. The inspiral from a MACHO binary composed of two 0.5 solar mass black holes enters the LIGO sensitive band around 40 Hz. The chirp signal increases in amplitude and frequency, sweeping through the sensitive band to 4400 Hz in 140 seconds. By using evidence from microlensing events and theoretical predictions of the population an upper limit is placed on the rate of black hole MACHO inspirals in the galactic halo.

We demonstrate that electroweak symmetry breaking may be realized, with proper generation of the top and bottom quark masses for the same region of bulk mass parameters that lead to good agreement with precision electroweak data in the presence of a light Higgs. We compute the Higgs mass and demonstrate that for the range of parameters for which the Higgs boson has Standard Model-like properties, the Higgs mass is naturally in a range that varies between values close to the LEP experimental limit and about 160 GeV.

Also two-component bottle brush polymers are considered, where two types (A,B) of side chains are grafted, assuming that monomers of different kind repel each other.

Theories predict ``Janus Cylinder''-type phase separation along the backbone in this case. The Monte Carlo simulations, using the pruned-enriched Rosenbluth method (PERM) then are restricted to rather short side chain length. Nevertheless, evidence is obtained that the phase separation between an A-rich part of the cylindrical molecule and a B-rich part can only occur locally. The correlation length of this microphase separation can be controlled by the solvent quality. This lack of a phase transition is interpreted by an analogy with models for ferromagnets in one space dimension. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

This unique stellar system is both one of the oldest (8 Gyr) and most metal-rich ([Fe/H] ~ 0.4) open clusters in our Galaxy, and has a color-magnitude diagram (CMD) that exhibits both a red giant clump and a much hotter extreme horizontal branch. Fitting the Balmer lines of the white dwarfs in the cluster, using Keck/LRIS spectra, suggests that most of these stars are undermassive, <M> = 0.43 +/- 0.06 Msun, and therefore could not have formed from canonical stellar evolution involving the helium flash at the tip of the red giant branch. We show that at least 40% of NGC 6791's evolved stars must have lost enough mass on the red giant branch to avoid the flash, and therefore did not convert helium into carbon-oxygen in their core. Such increased mass loss in the evolution of the progenitors of these stars is consistent with the presence of the extreme horizontal branch in the CMD. This unique stellar evolutionary channel also naturally explains the recent finding of a very young age (2.4 Gyr) for NGC 6791 from white dwarf cooling theory; helium core white dwarfs in this cluster will cool ~3 times slower than carbon-oxygen core stars and therefore the corrected white dwarf cooling age is in fact ~7 Gyr, consistent with the well measured main-sequence turnoff age.

Here we argue that these difficulties arise owing to the significant modulation of the solar activity cycle, and that this modulation arises owing to either stochastic or deterministic processes. We analyse the implications for predictability in both of these situations by considering two separate solar dynamo models. The first model represents a stochastically-perturbed flux transport dynamo. Here even very weak stochastic perturbations can give rise to significant modulation in the activity cycle. This modulation leads to a loss of predictability. In the second model, we neglect stochastic effects and assume that generation of magnetic field in the Sun can be described by a fully deterministic nonlinear mean-field model -- this is a best case scenario for prediction. We designate the output from this deterministic model (with parameters chosen to produce chaotically modulated cycles) as a target timeseries that subsequent deterministic mean-field models are required to predict. Long-term prediction is impossible even if a model that is correct in all details is utilised in the prediction. Furthermore, we show that even short-term prediction is impossible if there is a small discrepancy in the input parameters from the fiducial model. This is the case even if the predicting model has been tuned to reproduce the output of previous cycles. Given the inherent uncertainties in determining the transport coefficients and nonlinear responses for mean-field models, we argue that this makes predicting the solar cycle using the output from such models impossible.

In this framework an asset is defined by its cash-flow structure. Each cash flow is modelled by a random variable that can be expressed as a function of a collection of independent random variables called market factors. With each such \"X-factor\" we associate a market information process, the values of which are accessible to market agents. Each information process is a sum of two terms; one contains true information about the value of the market factor; the other represents \"noise\". The noise term is modelled by an independent Brownian bridge. The market filtration is assumed to be that generated by the aggregate of the independent information processes. The price of an asset is given by the expectation of the discounted cash flows in the risk-neutral measure, conditional on the information provided by the market filtration. When the cash flows are the dividend payments associated with equities, an explicit model is obtained for the share-price, and the prices of options on dividend-paying assets are derived.

Dynamic splitting is used to create two 1d systems in a phase coherent state. The time evolution of the coherence is revealed in local phase shifts of the subsequently observed interference patterns. Completely isolated 1d Bose gases are observed to exhibit a universal sub-exponential coherence decay in excellent agreement with recent predictions by Burkov et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 200404 (2007)]. For two coupled 1d Bose gases the coherence factor is observed to approach a non-zero equilibrium value as predicted by a Bogoliubov approach. This coupled-system decay to finite coherence is the matter wave equivalent of phase locking two lasers by injection. The non-equilibrium dynamics of superfluids plays an important role in a wide range of physical systems, such as superconductors, quantum-Hall systems, superfluid Helium, and spin systems.

It specifically allows us to extract the effective depth of the ion trap as the activation energy for evaporation. As a function of the rf amplitude we find two distinct regimes related to the stability of motion of the trapped ions. For low amplitudes the entire trap allows for stable motion and the trap depth increases with the rf field. For larger rf amplitudes, however, rapid energy transfer from the field to the ion motion can occur at large trap radii, which leads to a reduction of the effective trapping volume. In this regime the trap depth decreases again with increasing rf amplitude.

Results: We show that the acceleration from purely thermal to ultra-relativistic kinetic regimes is abrupt and produces an internally structured blastwave. We resolved the structure of this ultra-relativistic shell in all stages, thanks to the adaptive mesh. We comment on the dynamical roles played by forward and reverse shock pairs in the phase of interaction with the free stellar wind and clearly identify the complex shock-dominated structure created when the shell crosses the terminal shock. Conclusion: We show that in our model where the terminal shock is taken relatively close to the massive star, the phase of self-similar deceleration of Blandford-McKee type can only be produced in the constant density, shocked wind zone.

The conventional approach to computing Casimir forces involves treating imaginary-time virtual photons with complex frequencies, yet these complex quantities are often not easily handled by standard numerical methods. To overcome this limitation, we leverage the analytical continuation of Maxwell's equations from imaginary time to the frequency domain, enabling a direct application of established numerical-electromagnetism techniques. Our strategy effectively converts the calculation of Casimir forces into an efficient and versatile numerical problem, opening the door to systematic studies of these quantum vacuum effects in complex geometries and material configurations.", "human_text": "  We describe a numerical method to compute Casimir forces in arbitrary geometries, for arbitrary dielectric and metallic materials, with arbitrary accuracy (given sufficient computational resources).

We develop the approach by systematically examining various formulations of Casimir forces from the previous decades and evaluating them according to their suitability for numerical computation. We illustrate our approach with a simple finite-difference frequency-domain implementation, test it for known geometries such as a cylinder and a plate, and apply it to new geometries. In particular, we show that a piston-like geometry of two squares sliding between metal walls, in both two and three dimensions with both perfect and realistic metallic materials, exhibits a surprising non-monotonic ``lateral'' force from the walls.

Among these, the most striking is oxygen depletion, which reaches values down to [O/Fe]~-0.4 in most clusters, but in M13 it goes down to less than [O/Fe]~ - 1. In this work we suggest that the anomalies are due to the super position of two different events: 1) PRIMORDIAL SELF-ENRICHMENT: this is asked to explain the oxygen depletion down to a minimum value [O/Fe]~ -0.4; 2) EXTRA MIXING IN A FRACTION OF THE STARS ALREADY BORN WITH ANOMALOUS COMPOSITION: these objects, starting with already low [O/Fe], will reduce the oxygen abundance down to the most extreme values. Contrary to other models that invoke extra mixing to explain the chemical anomalies, we suggest that it is active only if there is a fraction of the stars in which the primordial composition is not only oxygen depleted, but also extremely helium rich (Y~ 0.4), as found in a few GCs from their main sequence multiplicity. We propose that the rotational evolution (and an associated extra mixing) of extremely helium rich stars may be affected by the fact that they develop a very small or non existent molecular weight barrier during the evolution. We show that extra mixing in these stars, having initial chemistry that has already been CNO processed, affects mainly the oxygen abundance, and to a much smaller extent if affects the sodium abundance. The model also predicts a large fluorine depletion concomitant with the oxygen depletion, and a further enhancement of the surface helium abundance, which reaches values close to Y=0.5 in the computed models. We stress that, in this tentative explanation, those stars that are primordially O--depleted, but ARE NOT extremely helium rich do not suffer deep extra mixing. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

However, recent findings suggest that other factors, such as black hole mass and accretion rate, may also influence the dichotomy. Using a comprehensive dataset of AGN nuclear properties, we examine how these parameters shape the morphology and jet dynamics of radio galaxies. Our results indicate that the FRI/FRII distinction is more nuanced than previously thought, with certain nuclear characteristics playing a significant role in determining whether an AGN will exhibit FRI or FRII behavior. By incorporating these findings into existing theories, we propose a revised paradigm for understanding the complex relationships between AGN properties and radio galaxy morphology.", "human_text": "  We have investigated the influence of nuclear parameters such as black hole (BH) mass and photoionizing luminosity on the FRI/FRII transition in a sample of nearby (z<0.2) 3CR radio galaxies. The sample was observed with medium-resolution, optical spectroscopy and contains some galaxies with unpublished velocity dispersion measurements and emission-line fluxes. Measured velocity dispersions are 130-340 km/s with a mean of 216 km/s. Converting to BH mass, we find that the BH mass distribution is identical for FRIs and FRIIs, with a mean of approximately 2.5x10^8 Msun. We convert [OII] and [OIII] emission-line luminosities to photoionizing luminosity under the assumption that the gas is ionized by the nuclear UV continuum. Most of the galaxies with FRI morphology and/or low-excitation emission-line spectra have progressively lower BH masses at lower photoionizing (and jet) luminosities. This agrees with the Ledlow-Owen relation which states that the radio luminosity at the FRI/FRII transition depends on the optical luminosity of the host, L_radio ~ L_optical^1.8, because both L_radio and L_optical relate to AGN nuclear parameters. When recasting the Ledlow-Owen relation into BH mass versus photoionizing and jet luminosity, we find that the recasted relation describes the sample quite well. The FRI/FRII transition occurs at approximately an order of magnitude lower luminosity relative to the Eddington luminosity than the soft-to-hard transition in X-ray binaries. This difference is consistent with the Ledlow-Owen relation, which predicts a weak BH mass dependence in the transition luminosity. We conclude that the FRI/FRII dichotomy is caused by a combination of external and nuclear factors, with the latter dominating. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

This slope is due to the fact that the membrane resistance is \"short-circuited\" by the capacitance for high frequencies, a situation which may not be realistic. Here, we integrate non-ideal capacitors in cable equations to reflect the fact that the capacitance cannot be charged instantaneously. We show that the resulting \"non-ideal\" cable model can be solved analytically using Fourier transforms. Numerical simulations using a ball-and-stick model yield membrane potential activity with similar frequency scaling as in the experiments. We also discuss the consequences of using non-ideal capacitors on other cellular properties such as the transmission of high frequencies, which is boosted in non-ideal cables, or voltage attenuation in dendrites.

We show that in the transient regime the efficiency of the system as a pump is rather poor because it mainly absorbs charge from both leads in order to fill the levels located below the bias window. Under a finite bias and a low-frequency pumping signal the charge transferred across the system depends on the number of levels located within the bias window.

The statistical calculations show that, using the endpoint as a free parameter, the unaccounted right-handed couplings constrained by many beta decay experiments can change the fitted neutrino mass value, relative to the true neutrino mass, by not larger than about 5-10 %. Using, incorrectly, the endpoint as a fixed input parameter, the above change of the neutrino mass can be much larger, order of 100 %, and for some cases it can happen that for large true neutrino mass value the fitted neutrino mass squared is negative.

Here we present an integrated experimental and theoretical framework to understand and quantitatively predict how and when information spreads over social networks.

This have a profound effect on information diffusion: Firstly, most of the transmission takes place due to super-spreading events which would be considered extraordinary in population-average models.

The motivation for this research stems from the need to bridge the gap between molecular cloud properties and star-forming regions at smaller scales. By targeting millimeter dust cores as potential precursors to protostellar condensations, we aim to elucidate the early stages of star formation within the VMR. Utilizing a combination of submillimeter continuum surveys and near- and far-infrared photometry from public archives, we detect infrared counterparts for a significant fraction of identified millimeter dust cores. Our analysis reveals that these infrared sources exhibit characteristics indicative of protostellar activity, suggesting that millimeter dust cores may indeed serve as precursors to the formation of low-mass stars in the VMR cloud.", "human_text": "  The aim of this paper is to identify the young protostellar counterparts associated to dust millimeter cores of the Vela Molecular Ridge Cloud D through new IR observations (H_2 narrow-band at 2.12 micron and N broad band at 10.4 micron) along with an investigation performed on the existing IR catalogues. The association of mm continuum emission with infrared sources from catalogues (IRAS, MSX, 2MASS), JHK data from the literature and new observations, has been established according to spatial coincidence, infrared colours and spectral energy distributions. Only 7 out of 29 resolved mm cores (and 16 out of the 26 unresolved ones) do not exhibit signposts of star formation activity. The other ones are clearly associated with: far-IR sources, H_2 jets or near-IR objects showing a high intrinsic colour excess. The distribution of the spectral indices pertaining to the associated sources is peaked at values typical of Class I objects, while three objects are signalled as candidates Class 0 sources. We remark the high detection rate (30%) of H_2 jets driven by sources located inside the mm-cores. They appear not driven by the most luminous objects in the field, but rather by less luminous objects in young clusters, testifying the co-existence of both low- and intermediate-mass star formation. The presented results reliably describe the young population of VMR-D. However, the statistical evaluation of activity vs inactivity of the investigated cores, even in good agreement with results found for other star forming regions, seems to reflect the limiting sensitivity of the available facilities rather than any property intrinsic to the mm-condensations.

The spectrum is consistent with previous suggestions that the power-law components are X-ray emission from the sub-pc VLBI jet and from Bondi accretion at the core, but it is also consistent with a partial covering interpretation. The soft band is dominated by thermal emission from the diffuse plasma and is fit well by a two-temperature VAPEC model, plus a third power-law component to account for scattered nuclear emission, jet emission, and emission from X-ray Binaries and other point sources. Narrow fluorescent emission lines from Fe, Si, S, Ar, Ca and Ni are detected.

By contrast, our approach leverages pseudo-random number generators to create adaptive puncturing patterns that adaptively eliminate redundant parity bits without compromising the overall structure of the Turbo Code.

In this paper, we present and study a family of rate-1/2 partially systematic PCCCs, which we call pseudo-randomly punctured codes. We evaluate their bit error rate performance and we show that they always yield a lower error floor than that of their rate-1/3 parent codes.

Our formalism allows for a unified description of the traditional timelike branes/shells together with the signature-changing, or pure null, ones. This allows for a detailed comparison of the results in both situations.

We show in particular that (i) in asymmetric shells there is an upper bound for the energy density, and (ii) that the energy density within the brane vanishes when approaching a change of signature. The description of a signature change as a `singularity' seen from within the brane is considered.

We compare our results with models, complementing them with available measurements from the literature. We study the afterglow light curve and spectrum including X-ray data. We also present observations of the host galaxy. The observed optical emission was likely related to the large flare observed in the X-ray light curve. The apparent steep decay was therefore not due to the jet effect. Available data are indeed consistent with low collimation, in turn implying a large energy release, comparable to that of long GRBs. The flare properties also constrain the internal shock mechanism, requiring a large Lorentz factor contrast between the colliding shells. This implies that the central engine was active at late times, rather than ejecting all shells simultaneously. The host galaxy has red colors and no ongoing star formation, consistent with previous findings on this GRB. However, it is not a pure elliptical, and has some faint spiral structure. GRB 050724 provides the most compelling case for association between a short burst and a galaxy with old stellar population.

We consider mixtures with rods of different aspect ratios and spheres of different diameters, and we treat them within Onsager theory.

In each sector, we study the monodromy of a first integral of a Riccati system related to the hypergeometric equation. Then, on each sector, we include the presence of logarithmic terms into a continuous phenomenon and view a Stokes multiplier related to a 1-summable solution as the limit of an obstruction that prevents a pair of eigenvectors of the monodromy operators, one at each singular point, to coincide.

Radiation from the protostar pushes the inner wall of the disk outward. The material agglomerates and forms planets in radial sequence. The outer planets are formed slowly by classical dynamical mechanisms acting in the snow zone. Planets have dense cores because of agglomeration.   Not one of the exoplanets discovered thus far is a planet. They are cryptoplanets formed from matter ejected by protostars. When protostars have excessive infall at high latitudes, they partially balance angular momentum through outflow at the equator as they spin up. The ejected matter is trapped in the magnetic torus formed between the star and the disk, like a tokamak. The tokamak eventully reconnects and magnetic compression forms self-gravitating remnants trapped and compressed by a closed spherical magnetic field, spheromaks. Cooled spheromaks are cryptoplanets. They orbit near the star. They can merge with each other or fall into the star or be ejected. They can grow by accreting gas.

It is shown that, for both receivers, the problem at hand of utility maximization can be regarded as a non-cooperative game, and it is proved that a unique Nash equilibrium point exists. Simulation results show that significant performance gains can be obtained through both non-linear processing and spreading code optimization; in particular, for systems with a number of users not larger than the processing gain, remarkable gains come from spreading code optimization, while, for overloaded systems, the largest gainscome from the use of non-linear processing.

But this is deceptive. As we show by explicit calculation, although the relevant quantities are simultaneously measurable, they develop non-vanishing commutators when calculated back to the time of escape of the photon. This justifies Bohr's qualitative arguments in a precise way; and it illustrates how the details of the dynamics conspire to guarantee the requirements of complementarity.

The data reveal a correlation between Gamma and EW which turns over at Gamma <~ 2, but finds a weak anti-correlation for steeper photon indices.

Using geometric algebra and exterior calculus methods, we derive and classify various types of nonholonomic curvature flows that arise from different splittings of the metric-compatible Levi-Civita connection on tangent bundles. Our key results include a general framework for constructing new families of solutions to Einstein's field equations using these curve flows and solitonic hierarchies, which can be used to model complex physical phenomena in curved spacetime.", "human_text": "  The geometric constructions are elaborated on (semi) Riemannian manifolds and vector bundles provided with nonintegrable distributions defining nonlinear connection structures induced canonically by metric tensors.

The lifts of geometric objects on tangent bundles are performed for certain classes of d-connections and frame transforms when the Riemann tensor is parametrized by constant matrix coefficients. For such configurations, the flows of non-stretching curves and corresponding bi-Hamilton and solitonic hierarchies encode information about Ricci flow evolution, Einstein spaces and exact solutions in gravity and geometric mechanics.

The scaling of higher order correlations obeys the She-Leveque (1994) scalings corresponding to the two-dimensional dissipative structures, and this result does not change with the Mach number either. In contrast to $v$ which exhibits different scaling parallel and perpendicular to the local magnetic field, the scaling of $u$ is similar in both directions.

This paper reports the performances of the charge injection capability based on the ground experiments using a radiation damaged device, and in-orbit measurements of the XIS. The ground experiments show that charges are stably injected with the dispersion of 91eV in FWHM in a specific column for the charges equivalent to the X-ray energy of 5.1keV. This dispersion width is significantly smaller than that of the X-ray events of 113eV (FWHM) at approximately the same energy. The amount of charge loss during transfer in a specific column, which is measured with the charge injection capability, is consistent with that measured with the calibration source. These results indicate that the charge injection technique can accurately measure column-dependent charge losses rather than the calibration sources.

Our results show that a scenario with a constant EoS, consistent with a cosmological constant, is disfavored by the combined dataset, suggesting that the acceleration of the universe's expansion may be driven by a more complex evolution of dark energy.", "human_text": "  The variation of the expansion rate of the Universe with time produces an evolution in the cosmological redshift of distant sources (for example quasar Lyman-$\\alpha$ absorption lines), that might be directly observed by future ultra stable, high-resolution spectrographs (such as CODEX) coupled to extremely large telescopes (such as European Southern Observatory's Extremely Large Telescope, ELT). This would open a new window to explore the physical mechanism responsible for the current acceleration of the Universe. We investigate the evolution of cosmological redshift from a variety of dark energy models, and compare it with simulated data. We perform a Fisher matrix analysis and discuss the prospects for constraining the parameters of these models and for discriminating among competing candidates. We find that, because of parameter degeneracies, and of the inherent technical difficulties involved in this kind of observations, the uncertainties on parameter reconstruction can be rather large unless strong external priors are assumed. However, the method could be a valuable complementary cosmological tool, and give important insights on the dynamics of dark energy, not obtainable using other probes. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

Our targets are 74 F-M dwarfs in the young stellar associations Eta Cha, TW Hydrae, Beta Pic, and Tuc-Hor, spanning ages from 6 to 30 Myr. While the Halpha EW for most F and G stars are consistent with pure photospheric absorption, most K and M stars show chromospheric emission. By comparing Halpha EW in our sample to results in the literature, we see a clear evolutionary sequence: Chromospheric activity declines steadily from the T Tauri phase to the main sequence. Using activity as an age indicator, we find a plausible age range for the Tuc-Hor association of 10-40 Myr. Between 5 and 30 Myr, we do not see evidence for rotational braking in the total sample, thus angular momentum is conserved, in contrast to younger stars. This difference indicates a change in the rotational regulation at 5-10 Myr, possibly because disk braking cannot operate longer than typical disk lifetimes, allowing the objects to spin up. The rotation-activity relation is flat in our sample; in contrast to main-sequence stars, there is no linear correlation for slow rotators. We argue that this is because young stars generate their magnetic fields in a fundamentally different way from main-sequence stars, and not just the result of a saturated solar-type dynamo. By comparing our rotational velocities with published rotation periods for a subset of stars, we determine ages of 13 (7-20) Myr and 9 (7-17} Myr for the Eta Cha and TWA associations, respectively, consistent with previous estimates.

Motivated by the need to identify precursors of massive stars, which are rare and elusive, we aimed to characterize the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of HMPOs using multi-wavelength data from GLIMPSE and other telescopes. We employed a multi-step approach: first, we identified candidate HMPOs based on their IRAC colors; then, we cross-matched these sources with other catalogs to obtain additional information on their positions, distances, and SEDs. Next, we applied the Lada & Wilking (1985) and Enoch et al. (2009) criteria to classify the sources as HMPOs or not. Our results show that 27% of the GLIMPSE sources meet these criteria, indicating a significant population of HMPOs in our survey.

The colours, magnitudes and spectral indicies of sources in each of the 381 target fields were analysed and compared with the predictions of 2D radiative transfer model simulations. Although no discernable embedded clusters were found in any targets, multiple sources or associations of redenned young stellar objects were found in many sources indicating multiplicity at birth. The spectral index ($\\alpha$) of these point sources in 3.6--8.0mum bands display large values of $\\alpha$=2--5. A color-magnitude analog plot was used to identify 79 infrared counterparts to the HMPOs. Compact nebulae are found in 75% of the detected sources with morphologies that can be well described by core-halo, cometary, shell-like and bipolar geometries similar to those observed in ultra-compact HII regions. The IRAC band SEDs of the IR counterparts of HMPOs are best described to represent YSOs with a mass range of 8--20\\msun in their Class I stages when compared with 2D radiative transfer models. They also suggest that the high $\\alpha$ values represent reprocessed star/star+disk emission that is arising in the dense envelopes. Thus we are witnessing the luminous envelopes around the protostars rather than their photospheres or disks. We argue that the compact infrared nebulae likely reflect the underlying physical structure of the dense cores and are found to imitate the morphologies of known UCHII regions. Our results favour models of continuuing accretion involving both molecular and ionised accretion components to build the most massive stars rather than purely molecular rapid accretion flows.

In this paper, while we will briefly describe the first and the second subjects, we shall focus on the third subject, the secure classical communication via wire. This way of secure telecommunication utilizes the properties of Johnson(-like) noise and those of a simple Kirchhoff's loop. The communicator is unconditionally secure at the conceptual (circuit theoretical) level and this property is (so far) unique in communication systems based on classical physics. The communicator is superior to quantum alternatives in all known aspects, except the need of using a wire. In the idealized system, the eavesdropper can extract zero bit of information without getting uncovered. The scheme is naturally protected against the man-in-the-middle attack. The communication can take place also via currently used power lines or phone (wire) lines and it is not only a point-to-point communication like quantum channels but network-ready.

Our results demonstrate that future observations of the CMB and LSS can provide crucial constraints on the parameters of f(R) acceleration models, which may shed light on their potential to explain the accelerating expansion of the universe.", "human_text": "  Models which accelerate the expansion of the universe through the addition of a function of the Ricci scalar f(R) leave a characteristic signature in the large-scale structure of the universe at the Compton wavelength scale of the extra scalar degree of freedom. We search for such a signature in current cosmological data sets: the WMAP cosmic microwave background (CMB) power spectrum, SNLS supernovae distance measures, the SDSS luminous red galaxy power spectrum, and galaxy-CMB angular correlations. Due to theoretical uncertainties in the nonlinear evolution of f(R) models, the galaxy power spectrum conservatively yields only weak constraints on the models despite the strong predicted signature in the linear matter power spectrum. Currently the tightest constraints involve the modification to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect from growth of gravitational potentials during the acceleration epoch. This effect is manifest for large Compton wavelengths in enhanced low multipole power in the CMB and anti-correlation between the CMB and tracers of the potential. They place a bound on the Compton wavelength of the field be less than of order the Hubble scale. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

We determine in this paper the star formation properties of six additional DLA galaxies. The derived results confirm that no single star formation history explains the diverse sets of abundance patterns in DLAs. We demonstrate that the various star formation histories reproducing the DLA abundance patterns are typical of local irregular, dwarf starburst and quiescent spiral galaxies. Independent of the star formation history, the DLAs have a common characteristic of being weak star forming galaxies; models with high star formation efficiencies are ruled out. All the derived DLA star formation rates per unit area are moderate or low, with values between -3.2 < log SFR < -1.1 M_sol yr^{-1} kpc^{-2}. The DLA abundance patterns require a large spread in ages ranging from 20 Myr up to 3 Gyr. The oldest DLA in our sample is observed at z_DLA=1.864 with an age estimated to more than 3 Gyr; it nicely indicates that galaxies were already forming at z_f>10. But, most of the DLAs show ages much younger than that of the Universe at the epoch of observation. Young galaxies thus seem to populate the high redshift Universe at z>2, suggesting relatively low redshifts of formation (z~3) for most high-redshift galaxies. The DLA star formation properties are compared with those of other high-redshift galaxies identified in deep imaging surveys with the aim of obtaining a global picture of high-redshift objects.

Next we demonstrate that the same Weyl types characterize warped product spacetimes with a one-dimensional Lorentzian (timelike) factor, whereas warped spacetimes with a two-dimensional Lorentzian factor are restricted to the types D or O. By exploring the Bianchi identities, we then analyze the simplest non-trivial case from the above classes - type D vacuum spacetimes, possibly with a cosmological constant, dropping, however, the assumptions that the spacetime is static, stationary or warped.

That theory promised a \"general\" and \"homogeneous\" treatment of numerous questions arising in various 19th-century theoretical contexts, and it hinged on two theorems, stated independently by Jordan and Weierstrass, that would today be considered equivalent. It was, however, the perceived difference between those two theorems that sparked the 1874 controversy.

Moreover, these practices reveal not only tacit knowledge, local ways of thinking, but also -- in light of a long history tracing back to the work of Lagrange, Laplace, Cau- chy, and Hermite -- two internal philosophies regarding the significance of generality which are inseparable from two disciplinary ideals opposing algebra and arithmetic.

The FICB is a remnant radiation signal from the early universe, which has been perturbed by various astrophysical processes over cosmic time. To address this challenge, we employ a novel approach that involves cross-calibrating the COBE/DIRBE's far-infrared data with the WHAM's H-alpha line emission map, thereby accounting for the diffuse Galactic and extragalactic background components. Our analysis relies on a sophisticated radiative transfer model, which is used to simulate the interstellar medium's optical depth and dust extinction effects, thus enabling us to deconvolve the FICB signal from the COBE/DIRBE data. This study seeks to shed light on the FICB's properties, provide insights into the cosmic baryon budget, and offer a new perspective on the distant universe's history.", "human_text": "  Determination of the cosmic infrared background (CIB) at far infrared wavelengths using COBE/DIRBE data is limited by the accuracy to which foreground interplanetary and Galactic dust emission can be modeled and subtracted. Previous determinations of the far infrared CIB (e.g., Hauser et al. 1998) were based on the detection of residual isotropic emission in skymaps from which the emission from interplanetary dust and the neutral interstellar medium were removed. In this paper we use the Wisconsin H-alpha Mapper (WHAM) Northern Sky Survey as a tracer of the ionized medium to examine the effect of this foreground component on determination of the CIB. We decompose the DIRBE far infrared data for five high Galactic latitude regions into H I and H-alpha correlated components and a residual component. We find the H-alpha correlated component to be consistent with zero for each region, and we find that addition of an H-alpha correlated component in modeling the foreground emission has negligible effect on derived CIB results. Our CIB detections and 2 sigma upper limits are essentially the same as those derived by Hauser et al. and are given by nu I_nu (nW m-2 sr-1) < 75, < 32, 25 +- 8, and 13 +- 3 at 60, 100, 140, and 240 microns, respectively. Our residuals have not been subjected to a detailed anisotropy test, so our CIB results do not supersede those of Hauser et al. We derive upper limits on the 100 micron emissivity of the ionized medium that are typically about 40% of the 100 micron emissivity of the neutral atomic medium. This low value may be caused in part by a lower dust-to-gas mass ratio in the ionized medium than in the neutral medium, and in part by a shortcoming of using H-alpha intensity as a tracer of far infrared emission.

We utilize a three-dimensional numerical code to simulate the evolution of unstable rotating stars, while also developing analytical tools to characterize the key features of these instabilities.

In particular, using numerical simulations in full General Relativity, we analyse the effects that the stellar compactness has on the threshold for the onset of the dynamical bar-mode instability, as well as on the appearance of other dynamical instabilities. By using an extrapolation technique developed and tested in our previous study [1], we explicitly determine the threshold for a wide range of compactnesses using four sequences of models of constant baryonic mass comprising a total of 59 stellar models. Our calculation of the threshold is in good agreement with the Newtonian prediction and improves the previous post-Newtonian estimates. In addition, we find that for stars with sufficiently large mass and compactness, the m=3 deformation is the fastest growing one. For all of the models considered, the non-axisymmetric instability is suppressed on a dynamical timescale with an m=1 deformation dominating the final stages of the instability. These results, together with those presented in [1], suggest that an m=1 deformation represents a general and late-time feature of non-axisymmetric dynamical instabilities both in full General Relativity and in Newtonian gravity.

We use the mass-flux conservation equation to determine the outflow speed of the solar wind at any location in the solar corona and take into account the integration along the line of sight (LOS). The main assumption we make is that no anisotropy in the kinetic temperature of the coronal species is considered. We find that at distances greater than 1 Rsun from the solar surface the widths of the emitted lines of O VI and Mg X are sensitive to the details of the adopted electron density stratification. However, Ly-$\\alpha$, which is a pure radiative line, is hardly affected. The calculated total intensities of Ly-$\\alpha$ and the O VI doublet depend to a lesser degree on the density stratification and are comparable to the observed ones for most of the considered density models. The widths of the observed profiles of Ly-$\\alpha$ and Mg X are well reproduced by most of the considered electron density stratifications, while for the O VI doublet only few stratifications give satisfying results. The densities deduced from SOHO data result in O VI profiles whose widths and intensity ratio are relatively close to the values observed by UVCS although only isotropic velocity distributions are employed. These density profiles also reproduce the other considered observables with good accuracy. Thus the need for a strong anisotropy of the velocity distribution (i.e. a temperature anisotropy) is not so clear cut as previous investigations of UVCS data suggested. ... ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

We test whether light-cone effects are important and whether the scaling relations used to compensate for an incorrect reference cosmology are in this case sufficiently accurate. We investigate the degeneracies in the cosmological parameters and the benefits of using the two-dimensional anisotropic power spectrum. Finally, we estimate the uncertainty with which w can be measured by proposed surveys at redshifts of about z=3 and z=1, respectively.   In the simulated survey we find that light-cone effects are small and that the simple scaling relations used to correct for the cosmological distortion work fairly well even for large survey volumes. The analysis of the two-dimensional anisotropic power spectra enables an independent determination to be made of the apparent scale of the BAO, perpendicular and parallel to the line of sight. This is essential for two-parameter w-models, such as the redshift-dependent dark energy model w=w_0+(1-a)w_a. Using Planck priors for the matter and baryon density and Delta(H_0)=5% for the Hubble constant, we estimate that the BAO measurements of future surveys around z=3 and z=1 will be able to constrain, independently of other cosmological probes, a constant w to ~ 12% and ~ 11% (68% c.l.), respectively.

For virial masses M_vir<~10^(14.5) M_sun, 11 clusters out of 12 (corresponding to 92% of the systems) are inhabited by a central radio source. This fraction decreases with higher masses as M_vir^(-0.4) and suggests that the majority of X-ray selected clusters host in their centre a radio source brighter than about 10^(20) W/Hz/sr. A division of the sample into clusters harbouring either point-like or an extended radio-loud AGN reveals that the steepening of the L_X-T relation for low-temperature clusters is strongly associated with the presence of central radio objects with extended jets and/or lobe structures. In the latter case, L_X\\propto T^(4) while for point-like sources one recovers an approximately self-similar relation L_X\\propto T^(2.3). Monte Carlo simulations show that the steepening of the L_X-T relation is not caused by clusters being under-luminous in the X-ray band, but rather by overheating, most likely caused by the interplay between the extended radio structures and the intracluster medium. In the case of low-mass systems, we also find a tight correlation between radio luminosity and cluster temperature. The effects of the central radio source on the thermal state of a cluster become less important with increasing cluster mass. (Abridged) The luminosity distribution of the cluster radio population differs from that of all radio sources, as there is a deficit of low-luminosity (L_R<~10^(22) W/Hz/sr) objects, while the number of high-luminosity ones is boosted. The net effect on the radio luminosity function is of a flattening at all luminosities L_R<~ 10^(24) W/Hz/sr. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

For n<=20 we provide simple analytic fitting formulae to describe the non-resonant part of the two-photon emission profiles. Combining these with the analytic form of the cascade-term yields a simple and accurate description of the full two-photon decay spectrum, which only involves a sum over a few intermediate states. We demonstrate that the cascade term naturally leads to a nearly Lorentzian shape of the two-photon profiles in the vicinity of the resonances. However, due to quantum-electrodynamical corrections, the two-photon emission spectra deviate significantly from the Lorentzian shape in the very distant wings of the resonances. We investigate up to which distance the two-photon profiles are close to a Lorentzian and discuss the role of the interference term. We then analyze how the deviation of the two-photon profiles from the Lorentzian shape affects the dynamics of cosmological hydrogen recombination. Since in this context the escape of photons from the Lyman-alpha resonance plays a crucial role, we concentrate on the two-photon corrections in the vicinity of the Lyman-alpha line. Our computations show that the changes in the ionization history due to the additional two-photon process from high shell (n>2) likely do not reach the percent-level. For conservative assumptions we find a correction DN_e/N_e~-0.4% at redshift z~1160. This is numerically similar to the result of another recent study; however, the physics leading to this conclusion is rather different.

To this end, we introduce novel concepts and techniques, leveraging tools from algebraic geometry and operator theory to establish a deep connection between J-class operators and hypercyclicity. We demonstrate that certain classes of J-class operators admit unbounded orbits with specific properties, and conversely, that the existence of such orbits can be used to diagnose whether an operator belongs to the J-class.

The fluid surface model is investigated within the framework of the conventional curvature model by using the canonical Monte Carlo simulations with dynamical triangulations. The mechanical strength of the surface is given only by skeletons, and no two-dimensional bending energy is assumed in the Hamiltonian. The skeletons are composed of elastic linear-chains and rigid junctions and form a compartmentalized structure on the surface, and for this reason the vertices of triangles can diffuse freely only inside the compartments. As a consequence, an inhomogeneous structure is introduced in the model; the surface strength inside the compartments is different from the surface strength on the compartments. However, the rotational symmetry is not influenced by the elastic skeletons; there is no specific direction on the surface. In addition to the three phases mentioned above, a collapsed phase is expected to exist in the low bending rigidity regime that was not studied here. The inhomogeneous structure and the fluidity of vertices are considered to be the origin of such variety of phases. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

Recent studies have confirmed that a system consisting of a flux rope embedded in a background field exhibits a catastrophic behavior, and the energy threshold at the catastrophic point may exceed the associated open field energy. The accumulated free energy in the corona is abruptly released when the catastrophe takes place, and it probably serves as the main means of energy release for CMEs at least in the initial phase. Such a release proceeds via an ideal MHD process in contrast with nonideal ones such as magnetic reconnection. The catastrophe results in a sudden formation of electric current sheets, which naturally provide proper sites for fast magnetic reconnection. The reconnection may be identified with a solar flare associated with the CME on one hand, and produces a further acceleration of the CME on the other. On this basis, several preliminary suggestions are made for future observational investigations, especially with the proposed KuaFu satellites, on the roles of the MHD catastrophe and magnetic reconnection in the magnetic energy release associated with CMEs and flares.

Most commercial ray tracing packages have been specifically designed for use with visible/IR systems and thus, though very flexible and sophisticated, do not provide the appropriate parameters to fully describe microwave antennas, and thus to compare with specifications. In this work we demonstrate that the Strehl ratio is equal to the phase efficiency when the apodization factor is taken into account. The phase efficiency is the most critical contribution to the aperture efficiency of an antenna, and the most difficult parameter to optimize during the telescope design. The equivalence between the Strehl ratio and the phase efficiency gives the designer/user of the telescope the opportunity to use the faster commercial ray-tracing software to optimize the design. We also discuss the results of several tests performed to check the validity of this relationship that we carried out using a ray-tracing software, ZEMAX and a full Physical Optics software, GRASP9.3, applied to three different telescope designs that span a factor of $\\simeq 10 in terms of D/lambda.

The ccbar pairs are produced in the initial collision and in the partonic system during the prethermal and thermal stages through the partonic channels ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J] and ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J]x, and then they dissociate in the latter two stages.

The primary challenge we sought to address is the interpretation of the varying radio emission from this supernova, which has been enigmatic since its discovery in 1987. Our motivation stems from the fact that SN 1987A represents a rare opportunity to study the aftermath of a massive star explosion up close, providing unique insights into the physics of stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis. Through our multi-epoch radio observations spanning from 1999 to 2014 at resolutions as fine as 0.1 arcsec (2 kpc), we have obtained detailed images of the SNR's morphology, circumstellar medium interactions, and shock-induced particle acceleration. Our findings reveal a rich tapestry of features, including a previously unknown filamental structure in the northwestern quadrant of the remnant, offering a new perspective on the explosion's physics and providing valuable constraints for theoretical models.", "human_text": "  Supernova 1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud provides a spectacularly detailed view of the aftermath of a core-collapse explosion. The supernova ejecta initially coasted outward at more than 10% of the speed of light, but in 1990 were observed to decelerate rapidly as they began to encounter dense circumstellar material expelled by the progenitor star. The resulting shock has subsequently produced steadily brightening radio synchrotron emission, which is resolved by the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) into an expanding limb-brightened shell. Here we present 15 years of ATCA imaging of Supernova 1987A, at an effective angular resolution of 0.4 arcsec. We find that the radio remnant has accelerated in its expansion over this period, from approx 3600 km/s in 1992 to approx 5200 km/s at the end of 2006. The published diameters of the evolving X-ray shell have been ~15% smaller than the corresponding radio values, but a simultaneous Fourier analysis of both radio and X-ray data eliminates this discrepancy, and yields a current diameter for the shell in both wave-bands of approx 1.7 arcsec. An asymmetric brightness distribution is seen in radio images at all ATCA epochs: the eastern and western rims have higher fluxes than the northern and southern regions, indicating that most of the radio emission comes from the equatorial plane of the system, where the progenitor star's circumstellar wind is thought to be densest. The eastern lobe is brighter than and further from the supernova site than the western lobe, suggesting an additional asymmetry in the initial distribution of supernova ejecta.

We employed a combination of high-resolution interferometric observations and radiative transfer modeling to elucidate the spatial structure and properties of the circumstellar SiO maser emission. Our results demonstrate that the masers are confined to a region surrounding the AGB star, with a maximum extension of ~100 AU, suggesting a possible link between the maser emission and the stellar wind dynamics in this system.

The SiO maser emission occurs at a few stellar radii from the central star, providing direct information on the stellar pulsation and on the chemical and physical properties of these regions. Our data also shed light on several aspects of the SiO maser pumping theory that are not well understood yet. We aim to determine} the relative spatial distribution of the 43 GHz and 86 GHz SiO maser lines in the oxygen-rich evolved star R Leo.

We confirm previous results obtained in other oxygen-rich envelopes. In particular, when comparing the 43 GHz emitting regions, the 28SiO v=2 transition is produced in an inner layer, closer to the central star. On the other hand, the 86 GHz line arises in a clearly farther shell. We have also mapped for the first time the 29SiO v=0 J=1-0 emission in R Leo.

Notably, we find that the CDW order competes with superconductivity, hindering its emergence in some parameter regimes. Conversely, under specific conditions, the CDW can facilitate superconductivity by promoting a more robust ground state. Our results provide insights into the underlying physics of these complex systems and offer potential explanations for the diverse phenomenology observed in cuprate materials and other two-dimensional metals.", "human_text": "  An interaction between electrons and lattice vibrations (phonons) results in two fundamental quantum phenomena in solids: in three dimensions it can turn a metal into a superconductor whereas in one dimension it can turn a metal into an insulator. In two dimensions (2D) both superconductivity and charge-density waves (CDW) are believed to be anomalous. In superconducting cuprates, critical transition temperatures are unusually high and the energy gap may stay unclosed even above these temperatures (pseudogap). In CDW-bearing dichalcogenides the resistivity below the transition can decrease with temperature even faster than in the normal phase and a basic prerequisite for the CDW, the favourable nesting conditions (when some sections of the Fermi surface appear shifted by the same vector), seems to be absent. Notwithstanding the existence of alternatives to conventional theories, both phenomena in 2D still remain the most fascinating puzzles in condensed matter physics. Using the latest developments in high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) here we show that the normal-state pseudogap also exists in one of the most studied 2D examples, dichalcogenide 2H-TaSe2, and the formation of CDW is driven by a conventional nesting instability, which is masked by the pseudogap. Our findings reconcile and explain a number of unusual, as previously believed, experimental responses as well as disprove many alternative theoretical approaches. The magnitude, character and anisotropy of the 2D-CDW pseudogap are intriguingly similar to those seen in superconducting cuprates. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

We present a new planet detection method that is capable of making large advances towards both of these objectives and describe a modest network of telescopes that is able to make the requisite observations. In a system where a known planet transits its host star, a second planet in that system will cause the time between transits to vary. These transit timing variations can be used to infer the orbital elements and mass of the perturbing planet even if it has a mass that is smaller than the mass of the Earth. This detection technique complements other techniques because it is most sensitive in mean-motion resonances where, due to degeneracies, other techniques have reduced sensitivity. Small ground-based observatories have already exceeded the photometric precision necessary to detect sub-Earth mass planets. However, TTV planet searches are currently limited by the relatively small number of high-precision transit data and insufficient observing time on existing telescopes. These issues will be compounded as the number of known transiting planets suitable for TTV study will increase substantially in the near future. A relatively modest investment in a ground-based network of small ($\\sim 0.5 {\\rm m}$ telescopes could provide the needed coverage and so dramatically increase the effectiveness of transit timing observations.

We compare the spherically symmetric PDR model by Stoerzer, Stutzki & Sternberg (1996) to observations of the three lowest rotational transitions of 12CO, 13CO J = 2-1 and J = 3-2 as well as the [CI] 3P_1-3P_0 fine structure transition. We study the role of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the chemical network of the PDR model and consider the impact of depletion as well as of a variation of the external FUV field. We find it difficult to simultaneously model the observed 12CO and 13CO emission. The 12CO and [CI] emission can be explained by a PDR model with a external FUV field of 1-0.75 chi_0, but this model fails to reproduce the observed 13CO by a factor of ~2. Adding PAHs to the chemical network increases the [CI] emission by 50% in our model but makes [CII] very faint. CO depletion only slightly reduces the 12CO and 13CO line intensity (by <10% and <20%, respectively).

These findings provide strong evidence for the existence of QSL states in ZnxCu4-x(OD)6Cl2, shedding new light on the physics of this intriguing material system.", "human_text": "  A three-dimensional system of interacting spins typically develops static long-range order when it is cooled. If the spins are quantum (S = 1/2), however, novel quantum paramagnetic states may appear. The most highly sought state among them is the resonating valence bond (RVB) state in which every pair of neighboring quantum spins form entangled spin singlets (valence bonds) and the singlets are quantum mechanically resonating amongst all the possible highly degenerate pairing states. Here we provide experimental evidence for such quantum paramagnetic states existing in frustrated antiferromagnets, ZnxCu4-x(OD)6Cl2, where the S = 1/2 magnetic Cu2+ moments form layers of a two-dimensional kagome lattice. We find that in Cu4(OD)6Cl2, where distorted kagome planes are weakly coupled to each other, a dispersionless excitation mode appears in the magnetic excitation spectrum below ~ 20 K, whose characteristics resemble those of quantum spin singlets in a solid state, known as a valence bond solid (VBS), that breaks translational symmetry. Doping nonmagnetic Zn2+ ions reduces the distortion of the kagome lattice, and weakens the interplane coupling but also dilutes the magnetic occupancy of the kagome lattice. The VBS state is suppressed and for ZnCu3(OD)6Cl2 where the kagome planes are undistorted and 90% occupied by the Cu2+ ions, the low energy spin fluctuations in the spin liquid phase become featureless.

It does not require long-distance freshwater transportation. If seawater is not utilized for increasing its productivity, this inexpensive new method is very environment-friendly. The author method has two working versions: (1) the first variant the warm (hot) atmospheric air is lifted by the inflatable tube in a high altitude and atmospheric steam is condenced into freswater: (2) in the second version, the warm air is pumped 20-30 meters under the sea-surface. In the first version, wind and solar heating of air are used for causing air flow. In version (2) wind and propeller are used for causing air movment.   The first method does not need energy, the second needs a small amount. Moreover, in variant (1) the freshwater has a high pressure (>30 or more atm.) and can be used for production of energy such as electricity and in that way the freshwater cost is lower. For increasing the productivity the seawater is injected into air and solar air heater may be used. The solar air heater produces a huge amount of electricity as a very powerful electricity generation plant.

At present, the kinematic information of CO data cubes are used to estimate virial masses and trace the total mass of the molecular clouds. Millimeter dust emission can also be used as a dense gas tracer and could unveil H2 envelopes lacking CO. These different tracers must be compared in different environments. This study compares virial masses to masses deduced from millimeter emission, in two GMC samples: the local molecular clouds in our Galaxy and their equivalents in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), one of the nearest low metallicity dwarf galaxy. In our Galaxy, mass estimates deduced from millimeter emission are consistent with masses deduced from gamma ray analysis and trace the total mass of the clouds. Virial masses are systematically larger (twice on average) than mass estimates from millimeter dust emission. This difference decreases toward high masses and has already been reported in previous studies. In the SMC however, molecular cloud masses deduced from SIMBA millimeter observations are systematically higher (twice on average for conservative values of the dust to gas ratio and dust emissivity) than the virial masses from SEST CO observations. The observed excess can not be accounted for by any plausible change of dust properties. Taking a general form for the virial theorem, we show that a magnetic field strength of ~15 micro Gauss in SMC clouds could provide additional support to the clouds and explain the difference observed. Masses of SMC molecular clouds have therefore been underestimated so far. Magnetic pressure may contribute significantly to their support. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

Although the D7-branes significantly modify the inflaton potential, they do not correct the quadratic term in the potential, and hence do not cause a uniform change in the slow-roll parameter eta. Nevertheless, we present a simple example based on the Kuperstein embedding of D7-branes, z_1=constant, in which the potential can be fine-tuned to be sufficiently flat for inflation. To derive this result, it is essential to incorporate the fact that the compactification volume changes slightly as the D3-brane moves. We stress that the compactification geometry dictates certain relationships among the parameters in the inflaton Lagrangian, and these microscopic constraints impose severe restrictions on the space of possible models. We note that the shape of the final inflaton potential differs from projections given in earlier studies: in configurations where inflation occurs, it does so near an inflection point.

The western feature shows an elongated structure along the jet and a good velocity correspondence with optical emission lines associated with the jet, suggesting that this feature is a jet-entrained gas. The eastern feature is elongated nearly east-west ending around the nucleus. A velocity gradient appears in the same direction with increasingly blueshifted velocities near the nucleus. This velocity gradient is in the opposite sense of that previously inferred for the putative circumnuclear disk.

We examine in more detail a previously studied quantum state of the massless minimally coupled scalar field, which we call a ``Helfer state''. This is a state in which the energy density can be made arbitrarily negative over an arbitrarily large region of space, but only at one instant in time. In the Helfer state, the negative energy density is accompanied by rapidly time-varying energy fluxes. It is the latter feature which allows the quantum inequalities, bounds which restrict the magnitude and duration of negative energy, to hold for this class of states. An observer who initially passes through the negative energy region will quickly encounter fluxes of positive energy which subsequently enter the region. We examine in detail the correlation between the energy density and flux in the Helfer state in terms of their expectation values. We then study the correlation function between energy density and flux in the Minkowski vacuum state, for a massless minimally coupled scalar field in both two and four dimensions. In this latter analysis we examine correlation functions rather than expectation values. Remarkably, we see qualitatively similar behavior to that in the Helfer state. More specifically, an initial negative energy vacuum fluctuation in some region of space is correlated with a subsequent flux fluctuation of positive energy into the region. We speculate that the mechanism which ensures that the quantum inequalities hold in the Helfer state, as well as in other quantum states associated with negative energy, is, at least in some sense, already ``encoded'' in the fluctuations of the vacuum.

If the slope of the linear relation ($\\beta$) between SN color excess and luminosity is fit empirically, then the bubble disappears. If, on the other hand, the color excess arises purely from Milky Way-like dust, then SN data clearly favors a Hubble bubble. We demonstrate that SN data give $\\beta \\simeq 2$, instead of the $\\beta \\simeq 4$ one would expect from purely Milky-Way-like dust.

For typical starting red-shifts the effect of finite particle number is to {\\it slow down} slightly the growth of power compared to that in the fluid limit (e.g. by about ten percent at half the Nyquist frequency), and to induce also dispersion in the growth as a function of direction at a comparable level. In the limit that the initial red-shift tends to infinity, at fixed particle density, the evolution in fact diverges from that in the fluid limit (described by the Zeldovich approximation). Contrary to widely held belief, this means that a simulation started at a red-shift much higher than the red-shift of shell crossing actually gives a worse, rather than a better, result. We also study how these effects are modified when there is a small-scale regularization of the gravitational force. We show that such a smoothing may reduce the anisotropy of the discreteness effects, but it then {\\it increases} their average effect. This behaviour illustrates the fact that the discreteness effects described here are distinct from those usually considered in this context, due to two-body collisions.

We argue that differential infrared extinction to the [NeV] emitting region due to dust in the obscuring torus is responsible for the ratios below the low density limit and we suggest that the ratio may be a tracer of the inclination angle of the torus to our line of sight.

Then, the spins of the asymptotic wavefunctions are not eigenfunctions of the Rashba Hamiltonian and the resulting coupling between spins in the Rashba region gives rise to sudden changes of the transmission probability when the Fermi energy is swept along the gap. After briefly examining the energy spectrum and eigenfunctions of a wire with extended Rashba coupling, we analyze the transmission through a region of localized Rashba interaction, in which a double interface separates a region of constant Rashba interaction from wire leads free from spin-orbit coupling. For energies slightly above the propagation threshold, we find the ubiquitous occurrence of transmission zeros (antiresonances) which are analyzed by matching methods in the one-dimensional limit. We find that a a minimal tight-binding model yields analytical transmission lineshapes of Fano antiresonance type. More general angular dependences of the external magnetic field is treated within projected Schroedinger equations with Hamiltonian matrix elements mixing wavefunction components. Finally, we consider a realistic quantum wire where the energy subbands are coupled via the Rashba intersubband coupling term and discuss its effect on the transmission zeros.

The trend arises because gas pressure support becomes important compared to angular momentum support in small dark matter haloes. We suggest that dwarf galaxies with rotational velocities ~ 40 km/s do not originate as thin discs, but rather are born as thick, puffy systems. If accreted on to larger haloes, tenuous dwarfs of this kind will be more susceptible to gas loss or tidal transformation than scaled-down versions of larger spirals. For a constant temperature floor, pressure support becomes less important in large haloes, and this produces a tendency for massive isolated galaxies to have thinner discs and more efficient star formation than their less massive counterparts, as observed.

To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel, data-driven approach that exploits recent advances in multidimensional partitioning and dynamic load balancing techniques. Our methodology involves a two-stage process: first, we develop an efficient algorithm for generating optimal, adaptive partitions of the data; second, we utilize a sophisticated scheduling framework to dynamically allocate computational resources based on changing demand patterns.

The existence of a universal initial mass function has been a cornerstone of our understanding of star formation, but uncertainties regarding the physical properties of prestellar cores have hindered its determination. We employ observations from the Herschel Space Observatory to measure dust temperatures in 24 prestellar cores, including those in rho Oph, Serpens, and Perseus. Our results show that these cores exhibit a range of dust temperatures, often exceeding the expected values based on their projected mass-luminosity relations. By considering these findings in conjunction with theoretical models, we find that the inferred core masses are systematically lower than predicted when assuming canonical dust properties. This discrepancy has significant implications for our understanding of the core mass function and its influence on the star formation process.", "human_text": "  We estimate the dust temperatures of the clumps in the rho Oph main cloud taking into account the 3D geometry of the region, and external heating from the interstellar radiation field and from HD147879,a nearby luminous B2V star, which is believed to dominate the radiation field in the region. We find that the regions where prestellar cores are observed (i.e. at optical visual extinctions >7 mag) are colder than ~10-11K. These dust temperatures are smaller than those which previous studies of the same region have assumed. We use the new dust temperatures to estimate the masses of the prestellar cores in the rho Oph main cloud from mm observations, and we find core masses that are larger than previous estimates by a factor of ~2-3. This affects the core mass function (CMF) of the region; we find that the mass at which the core mass spectrum steepens from a slope alpha~1.5 to a slope alpha~2.5 has moved from ~0.5 Msun to ~1Msun. In contrast with the CMF in other star forming regions (e.g. Orion), there is no indication for a turnover down to the completeness limit (~0.2Msun), but the CMF may flatten at around ~0.4Msun. We generalize our results to the prestellar cores in Taurus and in Orion. In Taurus the ambient radiation field heating the prestellar cores is believed to be weaker than than that in rho Oph. Hence, the dust temperatures of the cores in Taurus are expected to be below ~ 10-11 K.In Orion the radiation field is believed to be 10^3 times stronger than the standard interstellar radiation field. Based on this assumption we estimate that the dust temperatures of the prestellar cores in Orion are around ~20-30K. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

The model gives reliable folding rate predictions provided excluded volume terms that induce minor structural cooperativity are included in the interaction potential. In general, the cooperative folding routes have sharper interfaces between folded and unfolded regions of the folding nucleus and higher free energy barriers. The calculated free energy barriers are strongly correlated with native topology as characterized by contact order. Increasing the rigidity of the folding nucleus changes the local structure of the transition state ensemble non-uniformly across the set of protein studied. Neverthless, the calculated prefactors k0 are found to be relatively uniform across the protein set, with variation in 1/k0 less than a factor of five.

Aims: We present the first proper motion measurements of the thin dust filaments observed in the central parsec around SgrA* and investigate possible mechanisms that could be responsible for the observed motions. Methods: The observations have been carried out using the NACO adaptive optics system at the ESO VLT. The images have been transformed to a common coordinate system and features of interest were extracted. Then a cross-correlation technique could be performed in order to determine the offsets between the features with respect to their position in the reference epoch. Results: We derive the proper motions of a number of filaments and 2 cometary shaped dusty sources close (in projection) to SgrA*. We show that the shape and the motion of the filaments does not agree with a purely Keplerian motion of the gas in the potential of the supermassive black hole at the position of SgrA*. Therefore, additional mechanisms must be responsible for their formation and motion. We argue that the properties of the filaments are probably related to an outflow from the disk of young mass-losing stars around SgrA*. In part, the outflow may originate from the black hole itself.

We examine the spatial distribution of turn-off stars and demonstrate that all belong to NGC 1846 rather than to any field star population. In addition, the spatial distributions of the two sets of turn-off stars may exhibit different central concentrations and some asymmetries. By fitting isochrones, we show that the properties of the colour-magnitude diagram can be explained if there are two stellar populations of equivalent metal abundance in NGC 1846, differing in age by approximately 300 Myr. The absolute ages of the two populations are ~1.9 and ~2.2 Gyr, although there may be a systematic error of up to +/-0.4 Gyr in these values. The metal abundance inferred from isochrone fitting is [M/H] ~ -0.40, consistent with spectroscopic measurements of [Fe/H]. We propose that the observed properties of NGC 1846 can be explained if this object originated via the tidal capture of two star clusters formed separately in a star cluster group in a single giant molecular cloud.

An examination of the distribution of semi-major axes shows that there is a clear excess of planets with orbital periods around 3 or 4 days, corresponding to a~0.03$ AU, with a sharp cutoff at shorter periods (see Figure 1). It is believed that Jupiter mass planets form at large distances from their parent stars; some fraction then migrate in to produce the short period objects. We argue that a significant fraction of the `hot Jupiters' (a<0.1 AU) may arise in binary star systems in which the orbit of the binary is highly inclined to the orbit of the planet. Mutual torques between the two orbits drive down the minimum separation or periapse r_p between the planet and its host star (the Kozai mechanism). This periapse collapse is halted when tidal friction on the planet circularizes the orbit faster than Kozai torque can excite it. The same friction then circularizes the planet orbit, producing hot Jupiters with the peak of the semimajor axis distribution lying around 3 days. For the observed distributions of binary separation, eccentricity and mass ratio, roughly 2.5% of planets with initial semimajor axis a_p ~ 5au will migrate to within 0.1au of their parent star.

The high-resolution data provide a unique opportunity for a very detailed photometric study performed on one of the rare intermediate-age rich SMC clusters. The complete set of observations is centered on the association NGC 346 and contains almost 100,000 stars down to V ~28 mag. In this study we focus on the northern part of the region, which covers almost the whole stellar content of BS 90. We construct its stellar surface density profile and derive structural parameters. Isochrone fits on the CMD of the cluster results in an age of about 4.5 Gyr. The luminosity function is constructed and the present-day mass function of BS 90 has been obtained using the mass-luminosity relation, derived from the isochrone models. We found a slope between -1.30 and -0.95, comparable or somewhat shallower than a typical Salpeter IMF. Examination of the radial dependence of the mass function shows a steeper slope at larger radial distances, indicating mass segregation in the cluster. The derived half-mass relaxation time of 0.95 Gyr suggests that the cluster is mass segregated due to its dynamical evolution. From the isochrone model fits we derive a metallicity for BS 90 of [Fe/H]=-0.72, which adds an important point to the age-metallicity relation of the SMC. We discuss our findings on this relation in comparison to other SMC clusters. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

We perform a time resolved spectral analysis, and show that the sum of a power-law and a black-body gives acceptable fits to the time dependent spectra within the BATSE energy range, but overpredicts the flux in the WFC X-ray range. Moreover, a fit with a cutoff power-law plus a black-body is consistent with the WFC data, but the black-body component contributes a negligible fraction of the total flux.

We also found an interesting feature that the neutrino flux at $\\sim 10^{18}$ eV depends only on the cosmological evolution of the cosmic ray sources.

This volume formula holds for Grassmann manifolds with arbitrary n, p, q and L, while previous results pertained only to some special cases. Based on this volume formula, several bounds are derived for the rate distortion tradeoff assuming the quantization rate is sufficiently high. The lower and upper bounds on the distortion rate function are asymptotically identical, and so precisely quantify the asymptotic rate distortion tradeoff. We also show that random codes are asymptotically optimal in the sense that they achieve the minimum achievable distortion with probability one as n and the code rate approach infinity linearly.

By addressing long-standing ambiguities in defect theory, our work contributes to a deeper understanding of material behavior under stress, temperature, and other external influences, ultimately enabling more accurate predictions and optimization of material performance in diverse technological applications.", "human_text": "  Disclinations, first observed in mesomorphic phases, are relevant to a number of ill-ordered condensed matter media, with continuous symmetries or frustrated order. They also appear in polycrystals at the edges of grain boundaries. They are of limited interest in solid single crystals, where, owing to their large elastic stresses, they mostly appear in close pairs of opposite signs. The relaxation mechanisms associated with a disclination in its creation, motion, change of shape, involve an interplay with continuous or quantized dislocations and/or continuous disclinations. These are attached to the disclinations or are akin to Nye's dislocation densities, well suited here. The notion of 'extended Volterra process' takes these relaxation processes into account and covers different situations where this interplay takes place. These concepts are illustrated by applications in amorphous solids, mesomorphic phases and frustrated media in their curved habit space. The powerful topological theory of line defects only considers defects stable against relaxation processes compatible with the structure considered. It can be seen as a simplified case of the approach considered here, well suited for media of high plasticity or/and complex structures. Topological stability cannot guarantee energetic stability and sometimes cannot distinguish finer details of structure of defects. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

The spectra show weak and narrow SiII lines, and for a period of at least 10 days beginning around maximum light these profiles do not change in width or depth and they indicate a constant expansion velocity of ~10,600 km/s. We analyzed the observations based on detailed radiation dynamical models in the literature. Whereas delayed detonation and deflagration models have been used to explain the majority of SNe Ia, they do not predict a long velocity plateau in the SiII minimum with an unvarying line profile. Pulsating delayed detonations and merger scenarios form shell-like density structures with properties mostly related to the mass of the shell, M_shell, and we discuss how these models may explain the observed SiII line evolution; however, these models are based on spherical calculations and other possibilities may exist. SN 2005hj is consistent with respect to the onset, duration, and velocity of the plateau, the peak luminosity and, within the uncertainties, with the intrinsic colors for models with M_shell=0.2 M_sun.

To address this issue, we incorporate the Coriolis force into our 1D MHD model and study its impact on the g-mode spectrum. Our methodology involves solving the linearized perturbation equations, taking into account the influence of rotation on the wave propagation properties. We obtain a modified dispersion relation that accounts for the Coriolis force corrections, which are found to be significant in the low-frequency regime relevant to the g-modes.

These analytic results are compared with the satellite observations of the g-mode frequency shifts which are of the order one per cent as given in the GOLF experiment at the SoHO board.

To this end, we employ a suite of high-resolution cosmological simulations, which allow us to probe the behavior of dark matter halos across a broad range of masses and redshifts. We develop a novel methodology for estimating halo concentrations at virialization, based on a combination of Friends-of-Friends grouping and spherical overdensity techniques.

We re-analyze simulations from Ricotti (2003) in which such a correlation was proposed. We use a standard analysis of the halo density profiles and compare the old simulations to new ones performed with Gadget2, including higher resolution runs. We confirm Ricotti's result that, at virialization, the central log slopes alpha, at 5%-10% of the virial radius are correlated with the halo mass and that the halo concentration is a universal constant. Our results do not contradict the majority of published papers: when using a split power law to fit the density profiles, due to the alpha-concentration degeneracy, the fits are consistent with halos having a universal shape with alpha=1 or 1.5 and concentrations that depend on the mass, in agreement with results published elsewhere.   Recently, several groups have found no evidence for convergence of the inner halo profile to a constant power law. The choice of a split power law parameterization used in this letter is motivated by the need to compare our results to previous ones and is formally valid because we are not able to resolve regions where the slope of the fitting function reaches its asymptotic constant value. Using a non-parameterized technique, we also show that the density profiles of dwarf galaxies at z ~ 10 have a log slope shallower than 0.5 within 5% of the virial radius. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

The non-adiabatic behavior manifests itself in a twofold way, viz. by the over-reflection of the GAWs and by the generation of GAWs from EM perturbations. It is shown that these phenomena act as efficient transformers of the equilibrium flow energy into the energy of the perturbations for moderate and high shearing rate solar plasma flows. Efficient generation of GAW by EM takes place for shearing rates about an order of magnitude smaller than necessary for development of a shear instability.

By analyzing the polarization state of light emanating from the nuclei of 14 FR I radio-galaxies, we have obtained evidence for a significant amount of scattered light originating from a hidden broad-line region (BLR). This finding has important implications for our understanding of the accretion mechanisms and the role of dust in shaping the optical spectra of these objects. Our results suggest that the optical nuclei of FR I radio-galaxies are likely to be powered by a combination of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) and a contribution from star formation, with the former being dominant.", "human_text": "  We obtained optical imaging polarimetry with the ACS/HRC aboard the HST of the 9 closest radio-galaxies in the 3C catalogue with an FR I morphology. The nuclear sources seen in direct HST images in these galaxies are found to be highly polarized with levels in the range ~2-11 % with a median value of 7 %. We discuss the different mechanisms that produce polarized emission and conclude that the only viable interpretation is a synchrotron origin for the optical nuclei. This idea is strengthened by the analogy with the polarization properties of BL Lac objects, providing also further support to the FRI/BL Lac unified model. This confirms previous suggestions that the dominant emission mechanism in low luminosity radio-loud AGN is related to non-thermal radiation produced by the base of their jets. In addition to the nuclear polarization (and to the large scale optical jets), polarization is detected co-spatially with the dusty circumnuclear disks, likely due to dichroic transmission; the polarization vectors are tangential to the disks as expected when the magnetic field responsible for the grains alignment is stretched by differential rotation. We explored the possibility to detect the polarimetric signature of a misaligned radiation beam in FR I, expected in our sources in the frame of the FR I/ BL Lac unification. We did not find this effect in any of the galaxies, but our the results are not conclusive on whether a misaligned beam is indeed present in FR I. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

The steerable wavelet constructed from the second derivative of a Gaussian allows one to define three local morphological measures, namely the signed-intensity, orientation and elongation of local features. Detections of correlation between the WMAP and NVSS data are made with each of these morphological measures. The most significant detection is obtained in the correlation of the signed-intensity of local features at a significance of 99.9%. By inspecting signed-intensity sky maps, it is possible for the first time to see the correlation between the WMAP and NVSS data by eye. Foreground contamination and instrumental systematics in the WMAP data are ruled out as the source of all significant detections of correlation. Our results provide new insight on the ISW effect by probing the morphological nature of the correlation induced between the cosmic microwave background and large scale structure of the Universe. Given the current constraints on the flatness of the Universe, our detection of the ISW effect again provides direct and independent evidence for dark energy.

We examine how and when \"pasted\" or \"patched\" domain walls are formed, how long such walls evolve in the long run, and we believe that the significant portion of dark matter could be accounted for in terms of such domain-wall structure and its remnants. Of course, the cosmological QCD phase transition happened in the way such that the false vacua associated with baryons and many other color-singlet objects did not disappear (that is, using the bag-model language, there are bags of radius 1.0 fermi for the baryons) - but the amount of the energy remained in the false vacua is negligible.

We find that CN disks in higher mass galaxies are generally more stable than those in lower mass galaxies, because higher mass galaxies tend to have more massive BHs and more centrally concentrated stellar density profiles. We also consider the case in which the central stellar density profile has a core, which is often observed for ellipticals whose total stellar mass is higher than about 10^11 Msun. Such a cored stellar density profile leads to more unstable CN disks than the power-law density profile characteristic of less massive galaxies. However, the more massive BHs in high-mass galaxies act to stabilize the CN disk. Our results demonstrate that the gravitational potentials of both the central BH and the stellar component should be taken into account when studying the properties of CN disks, as their stability is sensitive to both the BH mass and the stellar density profile.

Our methodology involved applying various colour selection criteria to categorize the surveyed galaxies into distinct populations, enabling us to derive reliable estimates of their colours. The results reveal a complex interplay between galaxy colours and luminosities, with discernible signatures of recent starbursts and varying degrees of dust obscuration.

Combining galaxy evolution scenarios and a detailed spectral library of galaxies, we produce simulated catalogues incorporating segregation of the extragalactic population into component types (Normal, star-forming, AGN) via color cuts. As a practical application we apply our criteria to the deepest survey to be undertaken in the far-infrared with the AKARI (formerly ASTRO-F) satellite. Using the far-infrared wavebands of the Far-Infrared Surveyor (FIS, one of the focal-plane instruments on AKARI) we successfully segregate the normal, starburst and ULIRG populations. We also show that with additional MIR imaging from AKARI's Infrared Camera (IRC), significant contamination and/or degeneracy can be further decreased and show a particular example of the separation of cool normal galaxies and cold ULIRG sources. We conclude that our criteria provide an efficient means of selecting source populations (including rare luminous objects) and produce colour-segregated source counts without the requirement of time intensive ground-based follow up to differentiate between the general galaxy population.

Other structures are also detected in X-ray, in the galaxy projected number density map, and by weak-lensing. One of these clumps, could be gravitationally bound and associated to the main cluster.

Experiments with entangled pairs of particles have amply confirmed these quantum predictions, thus rendering local realistic theories untenable. Maintaining realism as a fundamental concept would therefore necessitate the introduction of 'spooky' actions that defy locality.

In the experiment, we measure previously untested correlations between two entangled photons, and show that these correlations violate an inequality proposed by Leggett for non-local realistic theories.

The problem we seek to solve is a longstanding one in cosmology: whether the universe's geometry can be accurately described by a simple, homogeneous space with zero or positive curvature, as opposed to more complex, anisotropic models. Our key idea involves leveraging topological constraints and geometric inequalities derived from the Einstein field equations to restrict the possible geometries of the cosmos. Employing a combination of differential geometry and algebraic topology, we develop a rigorous mathematical framework to analyze the relationships between the universe's curvature, volume, and spatial homogeneity. Through this approach, we derive novel bounds on the curvature of space-time that have significant implications for our understanding of the universe's large-scale structure and evolution.", "human_text": "  Probing the geometry of the universe is one of the most important endevours in cosmology. Current observational data from the Cosmic Microwave Background anisotropy (CMB), galaxy surveys and type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) strongly constrain the curvature of the universe to be close to zero for a universe dominated by a cosmological constant or dark energy with a constant equation of state. Here we investigate the role of cosmic priors on deriving these tight bounds on geometry, by considering a landscape motivated scenario with an oscillating curvature term. We perform a likelihood analysis of current data under such a model of non-trivial geometry and find that the uncertainties on curvature, and correspondingly on parameters of the matter and dark energy sectors, are larger. Future dark energy experiments together with CMB data from experiments like Planck could dramatically improve our ability to constrain cosmic curvature under such models enabling us to probe possible imprints of quantum gravity.

The distribution of the velocity shift dV of the HCN profiles with respect to the systemic velocity of the optically thin tracer is found to be more shifted toward bluer side than those of other infall tracers, indicating that the HCN traces inward motions more frequently. The dV distribution of each HCN hyperfine line for all sources is similar. Moreover the dV values obtained from different HCN hyperfine lines for each source are nearly similar. These may mean that most of starless cores are in similar kinematic states across the layers of the cores.

Sampling is commonly applied on routers in order to limit the load incurred by the collection of information that the router has to undertake when evaluating flow information for monitoring purposes. The sampling process in nearly all cases is a deterministic process of choosing 1 in every N packets on a per-interface basis, and then forming the flow statistics based on the collected sampled statistics. Even though this sampling may not be significant for some statistics, such as packet rate, others can be severely distorted. However, it is important to consider the sampling techniques and their relative accuracy when applied to different traffic patterns. The main disadvantage of sampling is the loss of accuracy in the collected trace when compared to the original traffic stream.

Utilizing a combination of mathematical techniques, including perturbation theory and asymptotic analysis, we derive an approximate analytic solution that accurately represents the super stellar clusters' behavior. Key to our approach is the incorporation of physical parameters into the model, allowing for predictive power and insight into the underlying dynamics. The Approximate Analytic Approach enables us to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the bimodal hydrodynamic solution, shedding new light on the properties and evolution of super stellar clusters in various astrophysical contexts.", "human_text": "  We look for a simple analytic model to distinguish between stellar clusters undergoing a bimodal hydrodynamic solution from those able to drive only a stationary wind. Clusters in the bimodal regime undergo strong radiative cooling within their densest inner regions, which results in the accumulation of the matter injected by supernovae and stellar winds and eventually in the formation of further stellar generations, while their outer regions sustain a stationary wind. The analytic formulae are derived from the basic hydrodynamic equations. Our main assumption, that the density at the star cluster surface scales almost linearly with that at the stagnation radius, is based on results from semi-analytic and full numerical calculations. The analytic formulation allows for the determination of the threshold mechanical luminosity that separates clusters evolving in either of the two solutions. It is possible to fix the stagnation radius by simple analytic expressions and thus to determine the fractions of the deposited matter that clusters evolving in the bimodal regime blow out as a wind or recycle into further stellar generations.

We find that the baryon mass fraction (f_b) within r500 is constant for systems with M500 between 6e13 and 1e15 Msun. Although f_b is lower than the WMAP value, the shortfall is on the order of both the observational systematic uncertainties and the depletion of baryons within r500 that is predicted by simulations. The data therefore provide no compelling evidence for undetected baryonic components, particularly any that vary in importance with cluster mass. A unique feature of the current analysis is direct inclusion of the contribution of intracluster light (ICL) in the baryon budget. The increase in X-ray gas mass fraction with increasing total mass is entirely accounted for by a decrease in the total stellar mass fraction, supporting the argument that the behavior of both the stellar and X-ray gas components is dominated by a decrease in star formation efficiency in more massive environments. Within just the stellar component, the fraction of the total stellar luminosity in the BCG and ICL decreases as velocity dispersion increases, suggesting that the BCG+ICL component, and in particular the dominant ICL component, grows less efficiently in higher mass environments. The degree to which this behavior arises from our sample selection, which favored systems with central, giant elliptical galaxies, remains unclear. A more robust result is the identification of low mass groups with large BCG+ICL components, demonstrating that the creation of intracluster stars does not require a massive cluster environment. Within r500 and r200, the BCG+ICL contributes on average 40% and 33% of the total stellar light, respectively. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}

At the cellular level, such adjustment relies on the transcription factors (TFs) which must rapidly find their target sequences amidst a vast amount of non-relevant sequences on DNA molecules. Whether these transcription factors locate their target sites through a 1D or 3D pathway is still a matter of speculation. It has been suggested that the optimum search time is when the protein equally shares its search time between 1D and 3D diffusions. In this paper, we study the above problem using a Monte Carlo simulation by considering a very simple physical model. A 1D strip, representing a DNA, with a number of low affinity sites, corresponding to non-target sites, and high affinity sites, corresponding to target sites, is considered and later extended to a 2D strip. We study the 1D and 3D exploration pathways, and combinations of the two modes by considering three different types of molecules: a walker that randomly walks along the strip with no dissociation; a jumper that represents dissociation and then re-association of a TF with the strip at later time at a distant site; and a hopper that is similar to the jumper but it dissociates and then re-associates at a faster rate than the jumper. We analyze the final probability distribution of molecules for each case and find that TFs can locate their targets fast enough even if they spend 15% of their search time diffusing freely in the solution.

Some remarkable flares are observed with fluence comparable to the prompt GRB fluence. Many GRBs have several flares, which are sometimes overlapping. Short, intense, repetitive, and late flaring can be most easily understood within the context of the standard fireball model with the internal engine that powers the prompt GRB emission in an active state at late times. However, other models for flares have been proposed. Flare origin can be investigated by comparing the flare spectra to that of the afterglow and the initial prompt emission. In this work, we have analyzed all significant X-ray flares from the first 110 GRBs observed by Swift. From this sample 33 GRBs were found to have significant X-ray flares, with 77 flares that were detected above the 3$\\sigma$ level. In addition to temporal analysis presented in a companion paper, a variety of spectral models have been fit to each flare. In some cases, we find that the spectral fits favor a Band function model, which is more akin to the prompt emission than to that of an afterglow. We find that the average fluence of the flares is 2.4e-7 erg/cm^2/s in the 0.2-10 keV energy band, which is approximately a factor of ten below the average prompt GRB fluence. These results, when combined with those presented in the companion paper on temporal properties of flares, supports the hypothesis that most X-ray flares are late-time activity of the internal engine that spawned the initial GRB; not an afterglow related effect.

Our key idea was to observe KS 1741-293 during a predicted outburst, using INTEGRAL's exceptional sensitivity in the hard X-ray domain (17-200 keV). We employed a multi-instrument approach, combining data from the IBIS, SPI, JEM-X, and OMC cameras to provide simultaneous coverage of various energy bands. Our analysis focused on time-resolved spectroscopy and flux monitoring, enabling us to derive reliable spectral parameters and detect significant variations in the source's emission characteristics. We report the observation of KS 1741-293 during a prolonged outburst, with pronounced periodicity in its X-ray emission, which we attribute to accretion disk variability and/or neutron star spin-period effects.", "human_text": "  KS 1741-293, discovered in 1989 by the X-ray camera TTM in the Kvant module of the Mir space station and identified as an X-ray burster, has not been detected in the hard X band until the advent of the INTEGRAL observatory. Moreover this source has been recently object of scientific discussion, being also associated to a nearby extended radio source that in principle could be the supernova remnant produced by the accretion induced collapse in the binary system. Our long term monitoring with INTEGRAL, covering the period from February 2003 to May 2005, confirms that KS 1741-293 is transient in soft and hard X band. When the source is active, from a simultaneous JEM-X and IBIS data analysis, we provide a wide band spectrum from 5 to 100 keV, that can be fit by a two component model, a multiple blackbody for the soft emission and a Comptonized or a cut-off power law model for the hard component. Finally, by the detection of two X-ray bursters with JEM-X, we confirm the bursting nature of KS 1741-293, including this source in the class of the hard tailed X-ray bursters.

The reduced density operator is governed by the master equation in which the effect of ac driving fields and the leakage to non-computational states are included. The theory is applied to the study of decoherence of a two-dimensional (2D) SQUID flux qubit coupled to control and readout circuits.

This condition reduces to the high-salt limit of Parsegian and Gingell where the interaction is exponentially screened and to the zero salt limit of Lau and Pincus in which the important length scales are the inter-plate separation and the Gouy-Chapman length. In the regime of low salt and high surface charges we predict - for any ratio of the charges on the surfaces - that the attractive pressure is long-ranged as a function of the spacing. The attractive pressure is related to the decrease in counter-ion concentration as the inter-plate distance is decreased. Our theory predicts several scaling regimes with different scaling expressions for the pressure as function of salinity and surface charge densities. The pressure predictions can be related to surface force experiments of oppositely charged surfaces that are prepared by coating one of the mica surfaces with an oppositely charged polyelectrolyte.

Utilizing a dedicated telescope array and state-of-the-art data reduction techniques, we obtained precise parallax measurements for a sample of high velocity white dwarfs. These data were then employed to constrain their interstellar distances, luminosities, and kinematic properties. Our results demonstrate that these objects exhibit a range of characteristics, including remarkably high tangential velocities and a tendency towards metal-poor compositions.

(2001) has been intensively discussed by various authors. In analyses undertaken to date, trigonometric parallaxes are crucial missing data. Distance measurements are mandatory to kinematically segregate halo object from disk objects and hence enable a more reliable estimate of the local density of halo dark matter residing in such objects.   We present trigonometric parallax measurements for 15 candidate halo white dwarfs (WDs) selected from the Oppenheimer et al. (2001) list. We observed the stars using the ESO 1.56-m Danish Telescope and ESO 2.2-m telescope from August 2001 to July 2004. Parallaxes with accuracies of 1--2 mas were determined yielding relative errors on distances of $\\sim5$% for 6 objects, $\\sim12$% for 3 objects, and $\\sim20$% for two more objects. Four stars appear to be too distant (probably farther than 100 pc) to have measurable parallaxes in our observations. Distances, absolute magnitudes and revised space velocities were derived for the 15 halo WDs from the Oppenheimer et al. (2001) list. Halo membership is confirmed unambiguously for 6 objects while 5 objects may be thick disk members and 4 objects are too distant to draw any conclusion based solely on kinematics. Comparing our trigonometric parallaxes with photometric parallaxes used in previous work reveals an overestimation of distance as derived from photometric techniques. This new data set can be used to revise the halo white dwarf space density, and that analysis will be presented in a subsequent publication. ", "model": "llama 3.1"}
