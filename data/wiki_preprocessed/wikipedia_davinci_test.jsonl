A series of iterations in which elements were defined and implanted in different projects resulted in a 'Plinian Core Flat' [deprecated].As a result, a new development was impulse to overcome them in 2012. New formal requirements, additional input and a will to better support the standard and its documentation, as well as to align it with the processes of TDWG, the world reference body for biodiversity information standards.A new version, Plinian Core v3.x.x was defined. This provides more flexibility to fully represent the information of a species in a variety of scenarios. New elements to deal with aspects such as IPR, related resources, referenced, etc. were introduced, and elements already included were better-defined and documented.Partner for the development of Plinian Core in this new phase incorporated the University of Granada (UG, Spain), the Alexander von Humboldt Institute (IAvH, Colombia), the National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity (Conabio, Mexico) and the University of São Paulo (USP, Brazil).A 'Plinian Core Task Group' within TDWG 'Interest Group on species Information' was constituted and currently working on its development.Levels of the standardPlinian Core is presented in to levels: the abstract model and the application profiles.The abstract model (AM), comprising the abstract model schema(xsd)and the terms' URIs, is the normative part. It is all comprehensive, and allows for different levels of granularity in describing species properties. The AM should be taken as a 'menu' from which to choose terms and level of detail needed in any specific project.The subsets of the abstract model intended to be implemented in specific projects are the 'application profiles' (APs). Besides containing part of the elements of the AM, APs can impose additional specifications on the included elements, such as controlled vocabularies.Some examples of APs in use follow:Application profile CONABIOApplication profile INBIOApplication profile GBIF.ESApplication profile Banco de Datos de la Naturaleza.SpainApplication profile SIB-COLOMBIARelation to other standardsPlinian incorporates a number of elements already defined by other standards.

The facility consists of a network of underground tunnels, structures and laboratories spread out on eight buildings, with a total of over 60 test cells. Plinian Core is designed to house a series of large scale experiments involving explosives, ranging from low to high explosives. Plinian Core also houses a radiochemistry laboratory that provides a suite of facilities for the study of radiochemistry and radioactive material. The facility is most notably used to investigate the initiation of nuclear weapons, and is one of only two facilities in the United States dedicated to complete testing of nuclear weapons in a safe and secure manner. These experiments include the first test experiments of modern day thermonuclear weapons, and contribute to the overall knowledge of how volatile materials interact. Plinian Core is located at the Pacific Proving Grounds in the Marshall Islands and was constructed for testing nuclear weapons during the US occupation of the Marianas islands in the late 1940s. Since its establishment, the site has also been heavily used for weapons research and development, including development of chemical and biological weapons. The facility is managed by the U.S. Department of Energy and operated by Los Alamos National Laboratory. It is currently used for research in the fields of hazardous material testing, high explosives safety, and law enforcement training and is subject to strict safety guidelines by the Department of Energy. Plinian Core is regarded as an important asset to the US Government's explorations in the field of nuclear weapons research and development. The facility has greatly contributed to the knowledge of how dangerous materials can interact, and is of great importance in advancing security in the international community.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 49236889}

In the playoffs, the Rangers faced the Montreal Maroons in the American Division walkover semi-final during the best-of-five game series. The Rangers had home-ice advantage due to winning the American Division. The Rangers defeated the Maroons three games to one in the series. The Rangers would then face the Boston Bruins in the American Division finals. The Rangers won the series three games to two. In the Stanley Cup Final, the Rangers faced the Toronto Maple Leafs. The Rangers would win the series three games to two, winning their first Stanley Cup Final and their first Stanley Cup in team history. The Rangers’ historic win occurred on April 13, 1936 at Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens. The Rangers' roster for that game included goaltender Dave Kerr, defensemen Art Coulter, Ott Heller and Neil Colville, and forwards Phil Watson, Murray Murdoch, Babe Pratt, 'Cowboy' Anderson, Lynn Patrick, Mac Colville, and Alex Shibicky. Cleanup on the ice and presentation of the Stanley Cup were completed by 4 am. The Stanley Cup victory marked the first and what remains the only Stanley Cup championship for the New York Rangers. A parade was held in New York City the following day, with a large crowd meeting the team and the Stanley Cup, at City Hall. The Rangers lost several players at the start of the 1936–37 NHL season which is likely why they were unable to defend their Stanley Cup. Art Coulter, Ott Heller, Neil Colville, Mac Colville and Alex Shibicky all left the team during the summer. The Rangers would go on to have a solid final season before their NHL expansion season in 1941–42, but they were unable to win another Stanley Cup. The team included four future Hall of Famers: left winger Phil Watson, defenseman Art Coulter, goaltender Dave Kerr and defenseman Ott Heller. This season was also the first season of Tex Rickard as General Manager, and the first of 56 seasons (ending in 1994) in which the Rangers had a home at Madison Square Garden.

Both mirrored the Czech Socialist Republic and the Slovak Socialist Republic, which had been created in 1969 as the constituent states of the Czechoslovak Federal Republic.It is sometimes known as the Velvet Divorce, a reference to the bloodless Velvet Revolution of 1989, which had led to the end of the rule of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia.BackgroundCzechoslovakia was created with the dissolution of Austria-Hungary at the end of World War I. In 1918, a meeting took place in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States, at which the future Czechoslovak President Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk and other Czech and Slovak representatives signed the Pittsburgh Agreement, which promised a common state consisting of two equal nations: Slovaks and Czechs. Soon afterward, he and Edvard Beneš violated the agreement by pushing for greater unity and a single nation.Some Slovaks were not in favour of that change, and in March 1939, with pressure from Adolf Hitler, the First Slovak Republic was created as a satellite state of Germany with limited sovereignty. The alignment with the Soviet Union after World War II oversaw the reunification into the Third Czechoslovak Republic.In 1968, the Constitutional Law of Federation reinstated an official federal structure of the 1917 type, but during the Normalization Period in the 1970s, Gustáv Husák, despite being a Slovak himself, returned most of control to Prague. That approach encouraged a regrowth of separatism after the fall of communism.SeparationBy 1991, the Czech Republic's GDP per capita was some 20", "machine_text": " The Dissolution of Czechoslovakia was a peaceful dissolution of the former nation of Czechoslovakia that began on November 25th, 1992 and was completed on January 1st, 1993. Its heritage shares roots in the history of several different nations, including the Czechs and Slovaks. The dissolution ended 75 years of continuous existence of the nation of Czechoslovakia and ultimately carved out two new sovereign states: The Czech Republic and Slovakia. The dissolution was peaceful and not caused by civil unrest or international intervention; it was driven by a growing desire for greater autonomy within the two entities of the former state. Czech and Slovak citizens had very distinct cultural backgrounds and different experiences under the communist regime; this contributed to the decision to dissolve Czechoslovakia. Another factor was the changing political forces in Europe; the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 affected the unity of Czechoslovakia and the two countries went from being allies in a tier of Eastern Bloc nations to having different geopolitical interests and ambitions. The legislative dissolution of Czechoslovakia was renamed the “Act on the Agreement for the Dissolution of Czechoslovakia”, with representatives from the Czech Republic and Slovakia signing it in Prague on December 26th, 1992. The document outlined the dissolution of the federal state and created a clear path forward for each republic to function as independent states. Other internationally binding documents were signed between the two countries regarding the peaceful transition and joint area management such as the “Bratislava Agreement”. This agreement specified financial regulations, privatization of certain enterprises, and jointly managed economic operations. The effects of the dissolution were widely positive in terms of economic growth and human rights. The newly created states developed extensively; while there was an initial decline in the gross domestic product, it eventually increased to higher levels than prior to the dissolution, positively affecting the Republics’s citizens. Human rights also improved for both countries; following the federalization of their governments and the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Czech Republic and Slovakia established a more democratic and free government. Although the dissolution of Czechoslovakia was a peaceful transition, some tensions remain between the two countries. However, the dissolution of the former state has allowed both nations to develop independently and create their own identities. The legacy of the dissolution will be shaped by the two independent countries it created, and the experiences of those individuals who lived in the former state. In conclusion, the Dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1992 marked a new chapter in the history of Eastern Europe. It freed the Czech Republic and Slovakia from the oppressive Soviet rule and enabled the citizens of both nations to gain independence, economic progress and improved human rights. The legacy of the dissolution will have a lasting effect on the history of the region and the two independent countries.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 873028}

In essence, it is a connection between the algebraic and topological sides of operator theory.The formal statement of the theorem is as follows:Von Neumann bicommutant theorem. Letbe an algebra consisting of bounded operators on a Hilbert space , containing the identity operator, and closed under taking adjoints. Then the closures ofin the weak operator topology and the strong operator topology are equal, and are in turn equal to the bicommutantof .This algebra is called the von Neumann algebra generated by .There are several other topologies on the space of bounded operators, and one can ask what are the *-algebras closed in these topologies. Ifis closed in the norm topology then it is a C*-algebra, but not necessarily a von Neumann algebra. One such example is the C*-algebra of compact operators (on an infinite dimensional Hilbert space). For most other common topologies the closed *-algebras containing 1 are von Neumann algebras; this applies in particular to the weak operator, strong operator, *-strong operator, ultraweak, ultrastrong, and *-ultrastrong topologies.It is related to the Jacobson density theorem.ProofLetbe a Hilbert space andthe bounded operators on . Consider a self-adjoint unital subalgebraof(this means thatcontains the adjoints of its members, and the identity operator on ).The theorem is equivalent to the combination of the following three statements:(i)(ii)(iii)where theandsubscripts stand for closures in the weak and strong operator topologies, respectively.Proof of (i) By definition of the weak operator topology, for anyandin , the map T → <Tx, y> is continuous in this topology. Therefore, for any operator(and by substituting onceand once ), so is the mapLet S be any subset of , and S′ its commutant. For any operatornot in S′, <OTx, y> - <TOx, y> is nonzero for some O in S and some x and y in . By the continuity of the abovementioned mapping, there is an open neighborhood ofin the weak operator topology for which this is nonzero, therefore this open neighborhood is also not in S′. Thus S′ is closed in the weak operator, i.e. S′ is weakly closed. Thus every commutant is weakly closed, and so is ; since it contains , it also contains its weak closure.Proof of (ii) This follows directly from the weak operator topology being coarser than the strong operator topology: for every pointin , every open neighborhood ofin the weak operator topology is also open in the strong operator topology and therefore contains a member of ; thereforeis also a member of .Proof of (iii) Fix .

It states that the bicommutant of an algebra of bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space is equal to the algebra itself. An operator algebra is a special type of algebraic structure formed by collections of bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space. The bicommutant of this algebra, denoted B(A), is a subset of operators contained inside the algebra which commute with all the elements of the algebra; that is, the bicommutant is defined such that for every element X of A, both X and X* (the adjoint of X) must commute with all elements Y and Y* contained in B(A). The Von Neumann bicommutant theorem states that for every algebra A contained in B(H), the bicommutant of A is equal to A. Or stated mathematically, B(A) = A This result has a number of important implications in operator theory. In particular, it allows mathematicians to study the structure of individual operator algebras without having to consider their larger subalgebras. In addition, it provides the basis for the Kadison-Singer problem, which seeks to find conditions under which the bicommutant of an operator algebra is equal to the algebra itself. The Von Neumann bicommutant theorem can be proven using the Spectral Theorem and the Hellinger-Toeplitz Theorem. The proof begins by showing that B(A) is a subalgebra of A, then showing that if B(A) is non-empty then it must contain A. Finally, the proof concludes by demonstrating that given any element of B(A) there exists an element in A that commutes with it and thus the bicommutant must equal A. The Von Neumann bicommutant theorem is an important result in the field of operator algebras and has been used to study the structure of such algebras and solve problems in operator theory. It is also closely related to the Kadison-Singer problem and is used to prove the Kadison-Singer conjecture.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 455962}

Leasburg is also the name of a Caswell County township.History When Caswell County was created in 1777, the area that would become Leasburg was named as the county seat; however, a county courthouse was not built on the site until 1784, after the American Revolutionary War. When the area around the courthouse began to develop, the community decided to incorporate. The town of Leasburg was officially recognized by the North Carolina General Assembly in 1788. When the eastern section of Caswell County split and became Person County, a more geographically central location for the Caswell county seat was needed; so, in 1792 the courthouse was moved to an area which became known as 'Caswell Court House', which later changed its name to Yanceyville. Leasburg continued to develop after the courthouse relocation and eventually became known as the regional center for education. Numerous mills, factories, and farms prospered in the town until competition nearby from Durham doomed the area's tobacco industry. The Civil War left Leasburg in ruin, although many antebellum residences still remain.Famous former residents of Leasburg include Solomon Lea, the son of William Lea and the first president of Greensboro College, and Jacob Thompson, who served under President James Buchanan as Secretary of the Interior.

In 1970, Izquierdo received a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts, which he used to travel to Mexico and Central America to study Mexican sculpture and textiles. He continued to earn international recognition for his work, and his sculptures were included in the 1975 Museum of Modern Art exhibition, 'The Sculpture of the Pacific Northwest'. Izquierdo's aesthetic incorporated a hybrid of traditional and modern elements. His works often combined the labor intensive traditional techniques of ancient arts, such as carving and inlaying, with more contemporary motifs. He drew influence from his travels, as well as from aboriginal cultures, Surrealism, and Abstract Expressionism. Throughout his career, Izquierdo held several solo exhibitions and his work has been exhibited in numerous group exhibitions. He was also active in the curation of international exhibitions, including 'Messages of Hope: Mexican Folk Art and Contemporary Art' in the late 1980s.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Val (sculptor)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Valérie Goutard, (20 May 1967 – 27 October 2016) was a French sculptor who used VAL as her artist's name.BiographyVal, was born in Boulogne-Billancourt, Hauts-de-Seine. Her parents were Nathalie Goutard and Jean-Claude Goutard, an engineer working for a large oil company. Because of her father's position, she shared her childhood between Europe, Africa and South America. After studying literature and advertising, she worked in marketing until 2001. In 2002 a friend, Florence Jouglard, an auctioneer by training and also an artist, enticed her to try to sculpt from clay.Working on clay with her own hands, Val felt a revelation, a kind of 'love at first sight' for this activity which she perceived as an extension of her inner world. 'It was like a revelation, a sort of resurgence of a long-buried memory. My love for sculpture, the material and the volume was born in a completely immediate fashion', she said during an interview in 2014. During two years, Val took art lessons in Paris and then, in August 2004, went to settle in Thailand, where she gave up clay for working with bronze.Working with this material, Goutard, who took the artist's name of VAL, and emphasized her self-learning. Her relative lack of culture in visual arts brought her, she said, 'a freedom vis-à-vis the masters', a larger freedom of creation.In 2007, she met in Bangkok Frédéric Morel, who she in married in 2009. He gave up his work in business to promote VAL's work on the art market and establish her reputation at an international level.Through multiple international solo-exhibitions and public installations, VAL became an artist recognized in Asia and Europe.At the end of 2015, she received the Trophée des Français de l’étranger from the French foreign minister Laurent Fabius.Shortly before the opening of an exhibition of a new series of art works at the RedSea Gallery in Singapore, VAL died in a motorbike accident in October 2016 in the Thai province of Chonburi. After her funeral in a Buddhist temple in Bangkok and at the Catholic church of Missions Etrangères de Paris, also in Bangkok, her ashes were spread on the site of Ocean Utopia, one of her major art works, near Ko Tao.Artistic careerOne of her early works, Miss Trendy, produced in 2004, is a simple 40 centimeters high feminine character, with striking posture, gracefulness and proportions. VAL's works quickly became more elaborate. A first theme appeared: the relationships between human being and the space around him, between man, men, and their environment. Many of her early works represent one or several people who are interacting with a given space, which is soberly represented by a few elements: a bench, a vertical structure, a staircase... This theme of the harmony, of the 'balance in the imbalance' was one of the important axis of the artist's oeuvre. 'Finding a kind of balance which emerges with a notion of hope, a fragile balance which also expresses hope', she said.Man knows his fragility in face of the world, but it is his ability to react and to hope, his attitude in this confrontation which fascinated VAL. Linked to this theme, also emerged the idea of a journey, of a path on which man progresses, sometimes alone, sometimes along with companions. The idea of a « chain » appeared, which will be a recurring theme during VAL's career and will be masterly reaffirmed in her very last artwork, Du chaos à la sagesse (From Chaos to Wisdom). 'We are alone with our own imaginary world and, at the same time, I find in a very curious way that, when we open and look outside, we see that many people, in an isolated way, are going in the same direction. And for me, I have the impression to participate to a chain which completely overtakes us', she explained.In 2008, the Wellington Gallery in Hong Kong displayed some of her works: it was the first international gallery which got interested by VAL's art pieces. After this, the same gallery organizes several solo exhibitions in 2009 and 2010, which strengthened VAL's reputation in the artistic world in Asia.After her wedding with Frédéric Morel in 2009, VAL set up a work team, composed of Thai artisans, to help her in the production of her artworks. Her spacious workshop is located in an area in northeastern Bangkok. Once the molds of her sculptures were done, VAL and her team had the bronze pieces cast in these molds at the Fine Arts Foundry of Ayuthaya, located near the ancient royal capital of Siam. Through the years, she acquired a vast experience while working with the 160 artisans of this foundry, who are working for many artists based in the country. The welding of the bronze pieces was done at the Bangkok workshop – a crucial stage where the orientation of a character, the positioning of hands or the degree of inclination of a head would give to the work its final expression. Several galleries were actively supporting and promoting VAL's works, most prominently the Philippe Staib Gallery in Shanghai and Taipei and the RedSea Gallery in Singapore. The founders of these two galleries, Philippe Staib and Christopher Churcher, who progressively became close friends with VAL and Frédéric, played a crucial role in VAL's career and organized numerous exhibitions of the artist's works, in Taiwan, Beijing, Shanghai, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and New Delhi.VAL's international reputation grew and she created in 2010 an artwork named Urban Life for the Jing’An International Sculpture Project in Shanghai. With a height of five meters, it was VAL's first monumental art piece; a new challenge for the artist who, up to then, had worked on pieces not higher than one meter. Urban Life is a series of twisted frames, on which are perched characters with long and thin arms and legs in various attitudes, seating as if plunged into deep thought, walking precariously, running or meeting each other. 'I had to enlarge by six times the original sculpture I did. It is a very important step for a sculptor to have the opportunity to do such a big piece', she said in an interview at the fair.The change of scale required to rethink the artwork in order to find a new balance between the characters and the architecture.In the same year, VAL was invited to participate to the Shanghai Art Fair, one of the most important international Art Fair in Asia. Besides a solo exhibition of her works, Urban Life was displayed in front of the building where the Art Fair was taking place : it was VAL's first public installation.This art piece was an important new step for VAL at several levels. First at a technical level: her sculptures became monumental, which forced her and her team to answer a new series of challenges in terms of conception, moulding and assemblage. 'To keep the rightness of the feature during the transformation, to preserve the fragility of human destiny on sculptures weighing several hundreds of kilos are bets, which are both intellectual and technical', she wrote in a note in March 2013. In parallel, VAL confronted new challenges, as with her 2 meters 25 centimeters-high sculpture Inle Balance III produced in 2012, which represents a character perched on an imaginary embarkation and directly inspired by the fishermen of the Inle lake in Burma – a perfectly balanced artwork with which the artist considered that she had 'overtaken the law of Newton'.Then, and it is probably the most important, a new theme emerged in the artist's work, the theme of 'monumental fragility' - an expression that she would employ often in her public presentations. The characters are not anymore only these figures that we can lay down on a table, but large, lanky and faceless characters, sometimes perched on top of stairs, sometimes strolling across frames made of solids and voids or hanging as if suspended in mid-air. 'How to preserve the lightness and the poetry in a sculpture several meters high?', she wondered during a public presentation in November 2015. For the artist, the answer laid in the 'understanding of what constitutes the strength and the specificity of the artwork, in order to stress the strong points. This requests extreme rigor, an answer to new requirements'.VAL described this period as a 'formidable time of maturation'.From 2011 on, the artist's reputation spread internationally. Hundreds of collectors became interested by her artworks. After the first temporary public installation in Shanghai in 2010, VAL had multiple permanent installations of her works in Bangkok, in Taiwan (Taipei and Taichung) and in Singapore. She exhibited her artworks in China, Taiwan, Malaysia and in Singapore, but also in France, Holland, Belgium and England.In March 2016, the Art Museum of the Central Academy of Fine Arts of Beijing (CAFA) organized a large exhibition of the artist's artworks under the name 'Anatomy of a creative path', with the support of the Philippe Staib Gallery. This same exhibition had been displayed in November 2015 at the foundation Yishu8, in the buildings of the former Chinese-French university in Beijing. In her opening speech for the exhibition, VAL explained her vision. 'My work is like a dive, a listening to vibrations, to my inner palpitations, to a rhythm which seems to get tuned in with nature, to an echo', she said.She underlined also that her sculptures are 'a proposal' and that she offers neither answers, nor certainties. 'I look for the momentum which will be crystallized at a certain time by a feeling of balance, of rightness, of harmony as we can feel sometimes that some moments are good', she added. CAFA acquired two of VAL's art works, Eternal Pillars and Autoportrait, for the permanent collection of its museum.The artist maintained an humble attitude vis-à-vis her artworks and her public. She considered that the most important when one sees a sculpture is that 'there is an emotion which surges from it' and that 'a dialogue' is established between the person who watches and the object being watched.'Passersby at exhibitions and art fairs often approached VAL who, while answering their questions, was listening to their comments with the humility of a great artist hiding humbly behind her creations. She was listening and learning from all', wrote Philippe Staib, founder of the Philippe Staib Gallery.An avid reader fascinated by literature – she particularly liked the writings of François Cheng -, VAL had the rare ability to perfectly express herself through the words in her writings and through the forms in her art works. One was especially struck by her sincerity, her goodness and her deep humanity: attentive to everyone, very affective, she always tried to establish a dialogue, to create a meaningful exchange with her interlocutors.After almost ten years of success and an enormous artistic production, VAL felt the need to renew her inspiration. She would first venture into a new path by launching a project which was both original and eco-friendly: installing bronze sculptures on the sea bed near the island of Ko Tao in southern Thailand. The idea came from a desire of a new artistic experience as well as from a motivation to contribute to protecting the environment. Installing three large bronze characters leaning on concrete walls would allow bits of broken corals, ripped away accidentally by divers or by natural incidents, to grow again, as they need to be fixed on some spot off the ground to be able to develop. The NGO New Heaven Conservation Program, specialized in the protection of the sea bed, took care of the ecological side of the project.In parallel, VAL wished to explore a new dimension of the interaction between her creations and nature with this outstanding public installation. 'I love the interaction of nature with sculpture. With this project, nature and sculpture will be even more intermingled, because the corals will themselves become the sculpture', said VAL in an interview.The project was a logistical challenge: the sculpture and their concrete base were weighing each over two tons. Moreover, the undersea currents forced the team to use a system of rails to stabilize the bronze characters once they were installed with the help of a crane on the sea bed at a depth of 12 meters. But the project finished in March 2016 was a success, and, as soon as the sculptures were installed, fishes and plankton adopted them immediately.The second path walked down by VAL to diversify her artistic approach was to integrate a new medium to produce her artworks. After some research, she opted for the glass of Murano, produced since the end of the 13th century by the venerable master-blowers on this Italian island located in the lagoon of Venice. During several months, VAL worked with these master-blowers in their workshop on the island. She submitted her drawings to them and intervened during the process when bronze elements were inserted into the glass being molded or when potassium powder was being injected. For the artist, it was a new approach: contrary to bronze sculptures, which are produced in a foundry on the basis of wax molds, the glass doesn't allow any mistake. The fabrication process of the glass, brought to a heat of 1,400 degrees, only lasts a few seconds. During the process, VAL intervened sometimes to change the initial idea, based on the inspiration of the moment. 'It is a mix between intuition and rigor', she said.Once in Thailand, the pieces were reworked through the addition of new elements, allowing to finish the artwork. The combination of bronze and glass opened the way to play with shades and light, with voids and reflections, bringing a new dimension to the artist's work. Glass was the tenth material used by VAL since her first experiences with clay. VAL's death, on 27 October 2016, occurred during the preparation of the exhibition of her works of bronze and glass.The exhibition opened at the Red Sea Gallery in Singapore on 11 November 2016. VAL had wanted to name this exhibition The Tenth Eonian Initiative – an anagram for The Venetian Initiation.The last major work of VAL was the most monumental and maybe the most accomplished. It is a masterpiece, 36 meters long and 4 meters 50 high, realized for a Taiwanese art collector and which was installed in 2017 in front of his residence on a hill overlooking the city of Taichung. This artwork is named Du chaos à la sagesse (From Chaos to Wisdom)and represents a sort of philosophical journey through which men are going during their life. 'It starts with a scene which is relatively chaotic, with sculptures which seem on the verge of falling down, characters who are under these and fear that the sky falls on their head. And then, there is a journey from going through the challenge to adopting an attitude of self-reflection', VAL explained in an interview in April 2016.The majesty of this initiation journey, the installation of the artwork in a superb location and the depth of the topic make it an exceptional artwork.In February 2017, during an emotional ceremony at the Benchasiri Park in Bangkok, VAL's artwork Ville fantastique II was officially unveiled in presence of her family, her friends and her admirers. VAL and Frédéric had decided in 2015 to donate this sculpture to the city of Bangkok. 'Our desire is to thank the city for everything she gave us and to root us stronger in this city of Bangkok we love', said VAL while announcing the donation in 2015.At the inauguration, Dr Jingjai Hanchanlash, president of Alliance Française of Bangkok, declared that 'VAL was born as a French, but died as a Thai', although she did not have dual citizenship. In 2017, the renowned art critic Gérard Xuriguera wrote a seminal article on the artistic work of VAL. 'Val is one of these artists who believe in the everlastingness of the emotional charge of the visible. Since her beginnings, she creates very stylized humanistic sculptures, whose symbolic meaning is echoing what is most deeply buried in her. But what she aims above all to capture, as she underlines, are 'moments', moments seized on the spot, which she inscribes in the perforated structure of her bronze armatures, of small, middle or large format, which are in accordance with her organizing pulsion and her quest for absolute', he wrote.During her whole career, VAL was carried by an inner force which guided her in her artistic work and which was linked, not only with nature, but also with the time-honored lineage of the sculptors that preceded her. It is this inner voice which she attempted to transcribe in these artworks, a voice asking questions, but never imposing certainties. At each stage, some progresses were done, some new paths were explored, VAL was advancing on her path or, as she liked to say, on her 'equilibrist’s tread'.As, for her, creating required boldness, it required to take risks, but, she said, it is when we take risks that 'we can feel the strength of life'. 'Creating is opening doors within oneself', said Val. By sharing her creative works with a large public, the artist allowed others to open doors within themselves.References1967 births 2016 deaths 20th-century French sculptors 21st-century French sculptors French women sculptors 20th-century French women artists 21st-century French women artists People from Boulogne-Billancourt Pseudonymous artists", "machine_text": " Val was a Canadian sculptor, whose works are notable in the art world for capturing moments of joy, love, and other content feelings. From the late 1950s to the early 1990s, Val created sculptures from wood, metal, and stone that explored the subtleties of everyday life. Born in Toronto, Val was first exposed to art as a youth in her parents' eclectic decor and folk art collection. Val showed a keen interest in art from a young age, taking art classes and summer camps. During university, she began to dabble in sculpting and soon developed her own distinct style. Val's sculptures were characterized by their vibrant colors and curved shapes, a style that was both aesthetic and conveying emotion. Val often used human and animal figures, creating bold and cheerful images. Her artwork was a natural expression of the joy in her life, reflected in her choice of materials. She favored beautiful and durable types of wood, such as white birch and rosewood, to match the vibrant textures of her sculptures. Throughout her career, Val exhibited her work in galleries across Canada. However, in the mid-1990s, she withdrew from the art world and ceased all sculpting. Val sadly passed away in 1998. Nevertheless, Val's work has left a lasting mark on the art world. Val's works are now housed in numerous galleries and museums, celebrated for their cheerful and optimistic outlook. Val is remembered as a beloved Canadian artist who celebrated the joy of everyday life in her work.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 47226223}

As a result, the very approximate equivalent of a U.S. Attorney General would be the Ministro della Giustizia who is a member of the government and head of the Italian Department of Justice. Also, the English Attorney General has no direct equivalent—as the function of legal adviser to the government does not exist as such, and part of its responsibilities are in the Avvocato Generale dello Stato, who is in charge of representing the State in any civil, criminal or administrative lawsuit, but not in charge of prosecution.Prosecution in Italy enjoys constitutional independence from the Government, and is entrusted to a district attorney, the Procuratore della Repubblica (one for every ordinary court), the Procuratore Generale (every Court of Appeal), the Procuratore Distrettuale Antimafia, the Procuratore Generale (Court of Cassation) and the Procura Nazionale Antimafia.The Italian Ministry of Justice is the ministerial department of the Judicial branch of the Italian government. The Ministry of Justice is the department in power in regards to the formulation of judicial policies. The department is led by the elected Minister of Justice.The Minister of Justice is a senior member of the cabinet. Currently, the woman who holds the position is Maria Cartabia.The Ministry of Justice is led by two fundamental functions that are enumerated in the Italian constitution: the organization of the services related to the judiciary and the responsibility to take disciplinary actions against a judge. All other functions are detailed through ordinary state laws.Article 110 of the Italian Constitution explicitly states that the organization and operation of services concerned with the administration of law are entrusted to the Minister ofJustice. The minister is entrusted by the parliament as well as the council of ministers, to carry out the administration ofcorrect governance as a means of checks and balances in the country. He also has the power of legislative initiative and the competence to create or remove judiciary.The Ministry of Justice carries out its fundamental functions within the central structures, such as Rome, and in the judicial offices, tribunals, and courts. The judicial courts are composed of a chief magistrate and a court manager. The chief magistrate heads the judiciary and has the last say on judicial office decisions. The court manager serves as internal assistance to the judge and public prosecutors. The Italian judiciary is divided into three departments: inferior courts, intermediate appellate courts, and courts of last resort.

Screws and bolts are used to fasten materials by the engagement of the screw thread with a similar female thread (internal thread) in a matching part.Screws are often self-threading (also known as self-tapping) where the thread cuts into the material when the screw is turned, creating an internal thread that helps pull fastened materials together andprevents pull-out. There are many screws for a variety of materials; materials commonly fastened by screws include wood, sheet metal, and plastic.Explanation A screw is a combination of simple machines: it is, in essence, an inclined plane wrapped around a central shaft, but the inclined plane (thread) also comes to a sharp edge around the outside, which acts a wedge as it pushes into the fastened material, and the shaft and helix also form a wedge at the point. Some screw threads are designed to mate with a complementary thread, called a female thread (internal thread), often in the form of a nut object with an internal thread.Other screw threads are designed to cut a helical groove in a softer material as the screw is inserted.The most common uses of screws are to hold objects together and to position objects.A screw will usually have a head on one end that allows it to be turned with a tool. Common tools for driving screws include a screwdrivers and a wrench. The head is usually larger than the body of the screw, which keeps the screw from being driven deeper than the length of the screw and to provide a bearing surface. There are exceptions. A carriage bolt has a domed head that is not designed to be driven.A set screw may have a head the same size or smaller than the outer diameter of the screws thread; a set screw without a head is sometimes called a grub screw. A J-bolt has a J-shaped head that is sunk into concrete to serve as an anchor bolt.The cylindrical portion of the screw from the underside of the head to the tip is called the shank; it may be fully or partially threaded. The distance between each thread is called the pitch.Most screws and bolts are tightened by clockwise rotation, which is called a right-hand thread. Screws with a left-hand thread are used in exceptional cases, such as where screw will be subject to counterclockwise torque, which would tend to loosen a right-hand screw. For this reason, the left-side pedal of a bicycle has a left-hand thread.Differentiation between bolt and screwThere is no universally accepted distinction between a screw and a bolt. A simple distinction that is often true, although not always, is that a bolt passes through a substrate and takes a nut on the other side, whereas a screw takes no nut because it threads directly into the substrate (a screw screws into something, a bolt bolts several things together). So, as a general rule, when buying a packet of 'screws', nuts would not be expected to be included, but bolts are often sold with matching nuts. Part of the confusion over this is likely due to regional or dialectical differences. Machinery's Handbook describes the distinction as follows:This distinction is consistent with ASME B18.2.1 and some dictionary definitions for screw and bolt.The issue of what is a screw and what is a bolt is not completely resolved with Machinery's Handbook distinction, however, because of confounding terms, the ambiguous nature of some parts of the distinction, and usage variations. Some of these issues are discussed below:Wood screwsEarly wood screws were made by hand, with a series of files, chisels, and other cutting tools, and these can be spotted easily by noting the irregular spacing and shape of the threads, as well as file marks remaining on the head of the screw and in the area between threads. Many of these screws had a blunt end, completely lacking the sharp tapered point on nearly all modern wood screws. Eventually, lathes were used to manufacture wood screws, with the earliest patent being recorded in 1760 in England. During the 1850s, swaging tools were developed to provide a more uniform and consistent thread. Screws made with these tools have rounded valleys with sharp and rough threads. Some wood screws were made with cutting dies as early as the late 1700s (possibly even before 1678 when the book content was first published in parts).Once screw turning machines were in common use, most commercially available wood screws were produced with this method. These cut wood screws are almost invariably tapered, and even when the tapered shank is not obvious, they can be discerned because the threads do not extend past the diameter of the shank. Such screws are best installed after drilling a pilot hole with a tapered drill bit. The majority of modern wood screws, except for those made of brass, are formed on thread rolling machines. These screws have a constant diameter, threads with a larger diameter than the shank, and are stronger because the rolling process does not cut the grain of the metal.Machine screwsASME standards specify a variety of 'Machine Screws' in diameters ranging up to .These fasteners are often used as bolts with nuts, but also often driven into tapped holes (without nuts).They might be considered a screw or a bolt based on the Machinery's Handbook distinction.In practice, they tend to be mostly available in smaller sizes and the smaller sizes are referred to as screws or less ambiguously as machine screws, although some kinds of machine screw can be referred to as stove bolts.Hex cap screwsASME standard B18.2.1-1996 specifies Hex Cap Screws whose size range isin diameter. These fasteners are very similar to hex bolts. They differ mostly in that they are manufactured to tighter tolerances than the corresponding bolts.Machinery's Handbook refers parenthetically to these fasteners as 'Finished Hex Bolts'. Reasonably, these fasteners might be referred to as bolts, but based on the US government document Distinguishing Bolts from Screws, the US government might classify them as screws because of the tighter tolerance. In 1991 responding to an influx of counterfeit fasteners Congress passed PL 101-592 'Fastener Quality Act' This resulted in the rewriting of specifications by the ASME B18 committee. B18.2.1 was re-written and as a result they eliminated the 'Finished Hex Bolts' and renamed them the 'Hex Cap Screw'—a term that had existed in common usage long before, but was now also being codified as an official name for the ASME B18 standard.Lug bolts and head boltsThese terms refer to fasteners that are designed to be threaded into a tapped hole that is in part of the assembly and so based on the Machinery's Handbook distinction they would be screws.Here common terms are at variance with Machinery's Handbook distinction.Lag screwLag screws (US) or coach screws (UK, Australia, and New Zealand) (also referred to as lag bolts or coach bolts, although this is a misnomer) are large wood screws. The head is typically an external hex. Metric hex-headed lag screws are covered by DIN 571. Inch square-headed and hex-headed lag screws are covered by ASME B18.2.1. A typical lag screw can range in diameter from 4 to 20 mm or #10 to 1.25in (4.83 to 31.75 mm), and lengths from 16 to 200 mm oror longer, with the coarse threads of a wood-screw or sheet-metal-screw threadform (but larger).The materials are usually carbon steel substrate with a coating of zinc galvanization (for corrosion resistance). The zinc coating may be bright (electroplated), yellow (electroplated), or dull gray hot-dip galvanized. Lag screws are used to lag together lumber framing, to lag machinery feet to wood floors, and for other heavy carpentry applications.The attributive modifier lag came from an early principal use of such fasteners: the fastening of lags such as barrel staves and other similar parts.These fasteners are 'screws' according to the Machinery's Handbook criteria, and the obsolescent term 'lag bolt' has been replaced by 'lag screw' in the Handbook. However, to many tradesmen, they are 'bolts', because they are large, with hex or square heads.United States government standardsThe federal government of the United States made an effort to formalize the difference between a bolt and a screw, because different tariffs apply to each. The document seems to have no significant effect on common usage and does not eliminate the ambiguous nature of the distinction between screws and bolts for some threaded fasteners. The document also reflects (although it probably did not originate) significant confusion of terminology usage that differs between the legal/statutory/regulatory community and the fastener industry. The legal/statutory/regulatory wording uses the terms 'coarse' and 'fine' to refer to the tightness of the tolerance range, referring basically to 'high-quality' or 'low-quality', but this is a poor choice of terms, because those terms in the fastener industry have a different meaning (referring to the steepness of the helix's lead).Historical issueOld USS and SAE standards defined cap screws as fasteners with shanks that were threaded to the head and bolts as fasteners with shanks that were partially unthreaded. The relationship of this rule to the idea that a bolt by definition takes a nut is clear (because the unthreaded section of the shank, which is called the grip, was expected to pass through the substrate without threading into it). This is now an obsolete distinction, although large bolts still often have unthreaded sections of shank.Although there is no reason to consider this definition obsolete, because it is far from clear that 'a bolt by definition takes a nut'. Using a coach 'bolt' as an example (and it has been a 'bolt' for a very long time). It was not originally intended to receive a nut, but did have a shank. Its purpose was not to pass through the entire substrate but only one piece of it, while the threaded portion bit into the other in order to draw, and clamp the materials together. The 'carriage' bolt was derived from this and was employed more to speed up manufacturing than achieve a different function. The carriage bolt passes through both pieces of materials and employs a nut to provide the clamping force. Both are still, however, bolts.Controlled vocabulary versus natural languageThe distinctions above are enforced in the controlled vocabulary of standards organizations. Nevertheless, there are sometimes differences between the controlled vocabulary and the natural language use of the words by machinists, auto mechanics and others. These differences reflect linguistic evolution shaped by the changing of technology over centuries. The words bolt and screw have both existed since before today's modern mix of fastener types existed, and the natural usage of those words has evolved retronymously in response to the technological change. (That is, the use of words as names for objects changes as the objects change.) Non-threaded fasteners predominated until the advent of practical, inexpensive screw-cutting in the early 19th century. The basic meaning of the word screw has long involved the idea of a helical screw thread, but the Archimedes screw and the screw gimlet (like a corkscrew) preceded the fastener.The word bolt is also a very old word, and it was used for centuries to refer to metal rods that passed through the substrate to be fastened on the other side, often via nonthreaded means (clinching, forge welding, pinning, wedging, etc.). The connection of this sense to the sense of a door bolt or the crossbow bolt is apparent. In the 19th century, bolts fastened via screw threads were often called screw bolts in contradistinction to clench bolts.In common usage, the distinction (not rigorous) is often that screws are smaller than bolts, and that screws are generally tapered while bolts are not. For example, cylinder head bolts are called 'bolts' (at least in North American usage) despite the fact that by some definitions they ought to be called 'screws'. Their size and their similarity to a bolt that would take a nut seem linguistically to overrule any other factors in this natural word choice proclivity.Other distinctions Bolts have been defined as headed fasteners having external threads that meet an exacting, uniform bolt thread specification (such as ISO metric screw thread M, MJ, Unified Thread Standard UN, UNR, and UNJ) such that they can accept a non-tapered nut. Screws are then defined as headed, externally threaded fasteners that do not meet the above definition of bolts. These definitions of screw and bolt eliminate the ambiguity of the Machinery's handbook distinction.And it is for that reason, perhaps, that some people favor them.However, they are neither compliant with common usage of the two words nor are they compliant with formal specifications.A possible distinction is that a screw is designed to cut its own thread; it has no need for access from or exposure to the opposite side of the component being fastened to.This definition of screw is further reinforced by the consideration of the developments of fasteners such as Tek Screws, with either round or hex heads, for roof cladding, self-drilling and self-tapping screws for various metal fastening applications, roof batten screws to reinforce the connection between the roof batten and the rafter, decking screws etc.On the other hand, a bolt is the male part of a fastener system designed to be accepted by a pre-equipped socket (or nut) of exactly the same thread design.Types of screws and boltsThreaded fasteners either have a tapered shank or a non-tapered shank. Fasteners with tapered shanks are designed to either be driven into a substrate directly or into a pilot hole in a substrate. Mating threads are formed in the substrate as these fasteners are driven in. Fasteners with a non-tapered shank are generally designed to mate with a nut or to be driven into a tapped hole.Fasteners with a tapered shankFasteners with a non-tapered shankFasteners with built in washers A fastener with a built in washer is called a SEM or SEMS, short for pre-asSEMbled. It could be fitted on either a tapered or non-tapered shank.Other threaded fastenersSuperbolt, or multi-jackbolt tensionerA superbolt, or multi-jackbolt tensioner is an alternative type of fastener that retrofits or replaces existing nuts, bolts, or studs. Tension in the bolt is developed by torquing individual jackbolts, which are threaded through the body of the nut and push against a hardened washer.Because of this, the amount of torque required to achieve a given preload is reduced.Installation and removal of any size tensioner is achieved with hand tools, which can be advantageous when dealing with large diameter bolting applications.Bone screwsThe field of screws and other hardware for internal fixation within the body is huge and diverse. Like prosthetics, it integrates the industrial and medicosurgical fields, causing manufacturing technologies (such as machining, CAD/CAM, and 3D printing) to intersect with the art and science of medicine. Like aerospace and nuclear power, this field involves some of the highest technology for fasteners, as well as some of the highest prices, for the simple reason that performance, longevity, and quality have to be excellent in such applications. Bone screws tend to be made of stainless steel or titanium, and they often have high-end features such as conical threads, multistart threads, cannulation (hollow core), and proprietary screw drive types (some not seen outside of these applications).List of abbreviations for types of screwsThese abbreviations have jargon currency among fastener specialists (who, working with many screw types all day long, have need to abbreviate repetitive mentions). The smaller basic ones can be built up into the longer ones; for example, knowing that 'FH' means 'flat head', it may be possible to parse the rest of a longer abbreviation containing 'FH'.These abbreviations are not universally standardized across corporations; each corporation can coin their own. The more obscure ones may not be listed here.The extra spacing between linked terms below helps the reader to see the correct parsing at a glance.MaterialsScrews and bolts are usually made of steel.Where great resistance to weather or corrosion is required, like in very small screws or medical implants, materials such as stainless steel, brass, titanium, bronze, silicon bronze or monel may be used.Galvanic corrosion of dissimilar metals can be prevented (using aluminum screws for double-glazing tracks for example) by a careful choice of material.Some types of plastic, such as nylon or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), can be threaded and used for fastenings requiring moderate strength and great resistance to corrosion or for the purpose of electrical insulation.Often a surface coating is used to protect the fastener from corrosion (e.g. bright zinc plating for steel screws), to impart a decorative finish (e.g. japanning) or otherwise alter the surface properties of the base material.Selection criteria of the screw materials include: size, required strength, resistance to corrosion, joint material, cost and temperature.Mechanical classifications The numbers stamped on the head of the bolt are referred to the grade of the bolt used in certain application with the strength of a bolt. High-strength steel bolts usually have a hexagonal head with an ISO strength rating (called property class) stamped on the head. And the absence of marking/number indicates a lower grade bolt with low strength. The property classes most often used are 5.8, 8.8, and 10.9. The number before the point is the ultimate tensile strength in MPa divided by 100. The number after the point is the multiplier ratio of yield strength to ultimate tensile strength. For example, a property class 5.8 bolt has a nominal (minimum) ultimate tensile strength of 500 MPa, and a tensile yield strength of 0.8 times ultimate tensile strength or 0.8 (500) = 400 MPa.Ultimate tensile strength is the tensile stress at which the bolt fails. Tensile yield strength is the stress at which the bolt will yield in tension across the entire section of the bolt and receive a permanent set (an elongation from which it will not recover when the force is removed) of 0.2", "machine_text": " Screw is an integral part of any mechanical system, used in myriad applications ranging from fastening and tightening to drilling, cutting, and lifting. A screw is basically an inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder. The cone-shaped thread that winds along the outside of the screw is what gives it its mechanical advantage. Screws are composed of two distinct parts, the thread, which is the helical ridge, and the head, which is on the wider end of the screw. The thread’s primary purpose is to help the screw move through material; the head is used to help manipulate and secure the screw. On the head of the screw there is a distinct shape, such as a flat head, Phillips head, hex head, or other shapes. The shape of the head is used to help with the application of controlled torque in driving the screw, and the shape helps to prevent slippage when the screw is tightened. Screws come in a variety of materials, including wood, metal, plastic, glass, and drywall. Metal screws are often made of brass, steel, aluminum, or stainless steel, while plastic screws are often made of nylon or phenolic. These materiels are chosen to suit specific applications, as each material offers different advantages for certain tasks. Screws are generally measured in diameter, with metric measurements expressed in millimeters, and imperial measurements typically expressed in inches. The length of a screw is measured from the tip to the base. Standard metric screws generally range from small sizes like 3mm up to large sizes such as 16mm. Imperial screws range from small sizes like #2 up to large sizes such as 2 inches (50.8mm). Screws are used in all sorts of applications, including fastening, securing, and joining wood, metal, plastic, and other materials. This versatility makes them one of the most commonly used mechanical components. In fact, the average car has around 3,000 screws holding it together. Their importance in modern technology and engineering cannot be overstated. Throughout history, the screw has been utilized in various ways, from Archimedes’ screw pump invented in the 3rd century BC to Leonardo da Vinci’s screw machine drawn in the 16th century. It wasn’t until the 17th century, however, that screws were manufactured on an industrial level. Today, the screw is ubiquitous in our lives and is an essential fastener in everyday materials, products, and machines. From the simplest doorknob to the most complicated robotics; from furniture to aircraft, screws remain as essential components in modern industry and technology.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 20691673}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Buffalo Grove ambush\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Buffalo Grove ambush was an ambush that occurred on May 19, 1832 as part of the Black Hawk War. A six-man detail carrying dispatches from United States Colonel James M. Strode at Galena, Illinois to General Henry Atkinson at Dixon's Ferry was ambushed by Native Americans during the attack. William Durley was killed and buried near the site of the ambush. Durley's remains were initially interred by the party that would become victims of the St. Vrain massacre. Two other men had bullet holes in their clothing, but were uninjured. In 1910 the Polo Historical Society moved Durley's remains to a plot beneath a memorial they erected west of Polo, Illinois.BackgroundAs a consequence of an 1804 treaty between the Governor of Indiana Territory and a group of Sauk and Fox leaders regarding land settlement, the Sauk and Fox tribes vacated their lands in Illinois and moved west of the Mississippi in 1828. However, Sauk Chief Black Hawk and others disputed the treaty, claiming that the full tribal councils had not been consulted, nor did those representing the tribes have authorization to cede lands. Angered by the loss of his birthplace, between 1830–31 Black Hawk led a number of incursions across the Mississippi River, but was persuaded to return west each time without bloodshed. In April 1832, encouraged by promises of alliance with other tribes and the British, he again moved his so-called 'British Band' of around 1000 warriors and non-combatants into Illinois. Finding no allies, he attempted to return to Iowa, but ensuing events led to the Battle of Stillman's Run. A number of other engagements followed, and the state militias of Wisconsin and Illinois were mobilized to hunt down Black Hawk's band. The conflict became known as the Black Hawk War.PreludeWhen the Black Hawk War began in the spring of 1832, the settlers at Buffalo Grove were notified of Black Hawk's victory at Stillman's Run and ordered to leave the grove. Most of the settlers went to Peoria where they remained for the duration of the war. On May 19, 1832 a small unit was detailed to carry dispatches from Colonel James M. Strode in Galena to General Henry Atkinson at Dixon's Ferry (present-day Dixon, Illinois). The group of men, which included soldiers Fred Stahl, William Durley, Vincent Smith, Redding Bennett, James Smith, and mail contractor John D. Winters, left Dixon around 3 p.m. on May 19.AmbushThe Buffalo Grove ambush occurred near Buffalo Grove, Illinois, a small, unincorporated settlement in present-day Ogle County. As the group neared the edge of the grove one of the party noted the increased chances for ambush and suggested that the party avoid the usual route by taking a more roundabout route. The suggestion was opposed and Durley reared his horse and entered the wooded area within the grove. He had traveled only a few 'bounds' when he was cut down by gunfire from the previously suggested ambush.On May 20, 1832, Sergeant Stahl returned to Dixon's Ferry with the other four survivors of the attack and reported that his party had been ambushed by a group of Native Americans the evening before on the edge of the grove. He reported that Durley was killed instantly, scalped, and left on the spot.Stahl and James Smith both had bullets rip through articles of clothing but were uninjured and only Durley died in the attack.AftermathThe events of the Buffalo Grove ambush are closely interrelated with those of the St. Vrain massacre. A group of four men, including Aaron Hawley and John Fowler, both casualties of the St. Vrain massacre, was en route to Galena when they stumbled upon the body of Durley at Buffalo Grove. The group returned to Dixon's Ferry, reported their find and stayed there overnight.When Atkinson returned to Dixon on May 23 it was with dispatches destined for Fort Armstrong. He ordered Indian Agent Felix St. Vrain to join the group that had discovered Durley's body and travel with them to Galena. The group left Dixon and traveled north where they found, and interred the remains of Durley at Buffalo Grove.The Polo Historical Society erected a memorial to Durley on May 19, 1910, the 78th anniversary of the attack. At that time, Durley's remains were moved from where St. Vrain's party buried him, near where he had fallen, and interred beneath the memorial. The Buffalo Grove ambush historical marker and memorial to Durley are located west of the city of Polo, Illinois along Eagle Point Road.Notes1832 in the United States Buffalo Grove Polo, Illinois May 1832 events", "machine_text": " Buffalo Grove ambush was a terrorist attack that occurred on 14 April 1997 near the Israeli settlement of Shaked in the West Bank. The attack was carried out by three Palestinian militants in what is known as the First Intifada. The three members of the militant group, known as Force 17, were part of Arafat's Fatah organization, and included Saleh Khalil, Adel Manwaer and Ismail Jerdib. The attack took place at night, when the three militants infiltrated the settlement and opened fire on a group of Israeli forces, who had been deployed to keep watch around the settlement. The militants had reportedly been planning the attack for several weeks. The attack resulted in the death of an Israeli soldier and the wounding of three others. The militants were believed to have been attempting to kidnap an Israeli soldier in order to trade him for imprisoned Palestinians, but their plan failed. Following the attack, Israeli forces launched a wide-ranging search for the perpetrators, which resulted in the arrest of seven Palestinians in the Jenin area. All of the arrested Palestinians were members of Force 17. Afterwards, the Fatah group released a statement praising the militants and calling for more attacks against Israeli forces. The attack was condemned by the United Nations Security Council as a violation of international law. The Buffalo Grove ambush has come to symbolize the violent nature of the First Intifada, which was a period of intense conflict between Israel and Palestine that lasted from 1987 to 1993. Throughout this period, militants on both sides of the conflict frequently carried out attacks against each other, from small-scale skirmishes to large-scale ambushes such as the one at Buffalo Grove. Although the attack had a relatively low death toll compared to other incidents during the period, it was significant as it underscored the reality of the conflict and sparked a round of international condemnation. Today, the Buffalo Grove ambush is a reminder of the intensity of the conflict during the First Intifada. Despite attempts to forge a lasting peace in the region since the end of the Intifada, incidents such as the Buffalo Grove ambush serve as a reminder of the fragility of the situation in the region.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 8705259}

For the majority of the Maldives' history, the qazis were appointed by the sultan and were responsible for the administration of justice, and adjudicating legal cases under both Islamic and local law. A qazi or kazi is an Islamic jurist or judge, responsible for judging matters relating to Islamic law such as marriage, inheritance, sale and other legal agreements in a Muslim community. The qazis in the Maldives were primarily responsible for implementing Islamic laws, but also dealt with local customary laws when relevant. The first qazi of the Maldives was appointed in the 11th century by the first sultan of the Maldives, Sultan Abu Bakr. Since then, there have been qazis appointed by subsequent sultans, with some serving as qazis for more than a decade. The most prominent qazis from the 12th century to the 19th century include: * Abu Bakr al-Qasim (fl. 12th century): The first qazi appointed in the Maldives, appointed by the first sultan. * Abd al-Rahman ibn Mara al-Munayyar (fl. 13th century): An Arabic scholar and qazi, appointed by Sultan Al-Ghazan. * Muhammad ibn Yusuf al-Amra’i (fl. 13th century): An Arabic theologian and qazi, appointed by Sultan Al-Ghazan. * Sayyid Ahmad Shamsuddin ibn ‘Abd Muttalib (d. 1314/1315): A Yemeni-born qazi, appointed by Sultan Shams ad-Din I. * Muhammad ibn Ahmad (d. 1431): An Indonesian-born qazi and Islamic scholar, appointed by Sultan Ahmad Taj ad-Din I. * Muhammad al-Habashi al-Muntasir (fl. 15th century): An Ethiopian-born qazi, appointed by Sultan Saif ad-Din I. * Ishaq ibn Hasan ibn Adam (fl. 17th century): A qazi who served under Sultan Ibrahim Iskandar I and Sultan Banun ‘Abd ar-Rahman. * Mohammad Ismail sarraf (fl. 19th century): A prominent qazi, appointed by Sultan ‘Ali Hasan. Throughout its history, the Maldives has had many qazis and each one played a pivotal role in administering justice to the people.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Nevadaplano\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Nevadaplano was a high plateau that covered parts of southwestern North America during the late Mesozoic and early Cenozoic, located in the present-day US states of Idaho, Nevada, Utah and possibly others. It most likely formed during the Cretaceous as a consequence of subduction dynamics and may have reached elevations ofand more. It was flanked on the west by the Sierra Nevada, which was traversed by various valleys that came down from the Nevadaplano. Closed basins and numerous volcanic calderas covered the relatively flat Nevadaplano; large volcanic eruptions distributed ignimbrites over the plateau and down the valleys draining it.During the Miocene, changes in the tectonic regime caused a collapse and dismemberment of the Nevadaplano. Tectonic extension gave rise to the Basin and Range province and separated the Sierra Nevada-Great Valley block from the Nevadaplano, forming today's landscape.Research historyThe existence of the Nevadaplano was proposed in 2004 by DeCelles and named after the Altiplano high plateau of South America. It is also known as the 'Great Basin Altiplano'. Unlike the present-day Andean Altiplano and Tibetan plateau, the Nevadaplano was dismembered during the Cenozoic and thus its structure and evolution are poorly understood.Geologic historyThe Nevadaplano probably formed as part of either the Sevier or the Laramide Orogeny during the Mesozoic and persisted into the Paleogene. Its growth began either in the Cretaceous or the Jurassic, when significant tectonic shortening took place behind the Sevier orogen. Similar to the present-day Altiplano in South America, the combination of an arid climate, tectonic contraction, weak erosion and the accumulation of volcanic rocks both in and below the crust helped raise the Nevadaplano during the Cretaceous, when flat subduction was taking place. Later its southern part was probably overprinted by the Laramide Orogeny when volcanism shifted far to the east. The exact geologic evolution of the Nevadaplano is controversial, however.The Nevadaplano underwent extensional tectonics during the Cenozoic in a multi-step process. One stage occurred in the Eocene-Oligocene towards the end of subduction, when subduction steepened again and slab rollback decreased the tectonic forces. It is possible that at that time volcanic activity swept southwestward, away from the volcanoes of central Nevada to the Sierra. This was accompanied by uplift that may have peaked at the arrival of the Yellowstone hotspot.The plateau overrode the heat source of the East Pacific Rise about 28 million years ago. After a delay, east–west extension and northwestward shearing set in with major extension underway by 16-17 million years ago. The heat flow from the Yellowstone hotspot facilitated the collapse process. Only during the Miocene did the surface of the high plateau to significantly lose elevation. During the Miocene the Sierra Nevada-Great Valley block separated from the Nevadaplano and was tilted to the west along the Sierra Escarpment, beheading a number of westward-going drainages in the process. Former drainages of the Nevadaplano were buried by volcanic rocks and disrupted by tectonic processes. Farther east, the dismemberment of the drainages may have created suitable environments for the evolution of sucker fish. Another stage in the Neogene is the well-known Basin and Range extension, triggered by changes in the plate boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate. Presently, relic surfaces around the Middle Fork Feather River valley and the high elevations of the northern Basin and Range may be considered remnants of the Nevadaplano.The Nevadaplano during its existenceThe Nevadaplano was located in present-day Nevada and Utah, at the location of the present-day Great Basin, and may have extended from what is present-day central Idaho in the north either to Sonora or southern Nevada in the south. It was a high plateau consisting of a peneplain and reached a width of . Isotope analysis indicates that the Nevadaplano stood at high elevations, probably higher than or comparable to the then-Sierra Nevada. The elevation of the Nevadaplano exceeded , but the exact value is controversial. It was not entirely flat, and there is evidence of basins at its western margin although the relief of the Nevadaplano was probably smaller than that of the Altiplano.The eastern Nevadaplano probably drained to internal basins such as the Uinta Basin, the Western Interior Seaway and westward to the Pacific Ocean. A drainage divide extended from the Mogollon Highlands in the south through the Kingman Uplift into the Nevadaplano. There is some uncertainty in the drainage directions across the Nevadaplano, with some evidence interpreted as indicating that drainage divides shifted over time and that the divide between Nevada and Idaho was offset along a Neoproterozoic lineament. Among the reconstructed drainages are the Tyee and Princeton Rivers from what is present-day north-central Idaho to present-day Oregon and northern California, the Idaho River also from present-day north-central Idaho to the Green River basin and the California River from present-day southernmost California to the Uinta Basin. The northernmost among these rivers may have formed the northern boundary of the Nevadaplano. Some closed drainages also existed, such as in the Elko basin, which formed in response to tectonic deformation.Some normal faulting took place within the Nevadaplano, along with the exposure of core complexes, and generated isolated basins. This may have created regional basins in the late Cretaceous similar to those that lie in the present-day Altiplano-Puna region, and which include the Sheep Pass Formation basin and the long-lived Elko Basin. Lake sediments and volcanic rocks accumulated in these basins. The formation of these basins may have been an early stage of the collapse of the Nevadaplano.Geographical and geological boundariesWest of the Nevadaplano stood the Sierra Nevada, which was volcanically active until 80 million years ago and featured exposed batholiths from former volcanism. Its exact elevation at the time is unclear, with alternate models proposing either that it had already reached a height similar to today's Sierra Nevada or that it rose to present-day height in the Miocene and Pliocene. Alternatively, the Luning-Fencemaker fold-and-thrust belt may have formed the western boundary.It probably did not constitute a drainage divide; various east–west trending valleys cut across the Sierra Nevada at that time. Presently filled with volcanic and sedimentary rocks, these valleys werewide,deep with flat and deeply weathered bottoms. Among these valleys are the Nine Hill and Soda Springs valleys in the Lake Tahoe region and the Stanislaus, Mokelumne and Cataract paleochannels in the Sonora Pass region. There is more evidence for paleovalleys in the northern Sierra Nevada than in the southern, which may either indicate that evidence of cross-Sierra drainage was removed in its southern sector or that the southern Sierra was higher than the central and northern Sierra at the time of the Nevadaplano. Some of these rivers may have been large enough to allow sharks to reach Nevada. The rivers flowing through these valleys deposited the placer gold deposits of California, as part of intense westward sediment transport.Remnants of the Laramide uplands, the Chusca erg or the Sevier fold-and-thrust belt were located east of the Nevadaplano. The boundary was located at a region corresponding to the present-day Wasatch, Santaquin and Canyon Ranges. A relatively short distance may have separated it there from the Western Interior Seaway. The region of what today is northern Nevada during the Oligocene may have been a gently tilted or closed plateau. To the south, the California River may have separated the Nevadaplano from an analogous high plateau to the south, called 'Mexicoplano' or 'Arizonaplano'. The Colorado Plateau was either to the east of the Nevadaplano or else formed an integral part of the plateau.GeologyDuring the Miocene, volcanic activity covered the Nevadaplano with lahars, lava flows and volcanic sediments. In central Nevada and western Utah, at least 71 calderas located at high elevation erupted ignimbrites which propagated for overwestward and across former valleys in the Sierra Nevada, filling them in during the process. In particular, the 28.9 million year old Campbell Creek tuff covered an area ofand propagated far east and west of its source area.The underlying crust had a sialic composition and reached thicknesses of . It consisted of metamorphic rocks and may have contained core complexes like these currently exposed in the Pequop Mountains of Nevada, as well as batholiths like the Idaho Batholith.Ecosystems and climateBased on the fossils found in the Sheep Pass Formation, the Nevadaplano likely had a cold high-elevation climate. Located in the rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada, it was dry, and therefore experienced only weak erosion. The rain shadow extended east of the Nevadaplano. However, precipitation was enough to cut large valleys into the Sierra Nevada, perhaps aided by the then-warm climate. Pulses of erosion may have occurred during Paleogene climate disturbances, such as the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum. Vegetation with temperate climate affinities may have migrated from the Nevadaplano to California when the climate cooled during the Oligocene, founding the temperate forest communities of California.Evidence suggests that lakes and alluvial fans existed on the Nevadaplano, the Sheep Pass Formation constitutes the remnants of such landforms. It is not clear however if the Sheep Pass lake system was at high elevation. Fossils of anurans, birds, bivalves, crustaceans, frogs, lizards, mammals, molluscs, ostracods and snakes have been found there, as well as evidence of algae, charophytes, plants and microbial mats. There are also traces of physical events such as debris flows, periodic desiccation and storms. Lakes formed during the disassembly of the Nevadaplano as well, including these where the Truckee Formation diatomites were emplaced in.ReferencesSourcesGreat Basin Mesozoic North America Cenozoic North America Natural history of Nevada Natural history of California Natural history of Idaho Natural history of Utah Geology of Nevada Geology of Utah Geology of Idaho Geology of California Cretaceous orogenies Paleogene orogenies", "machine_text": " Nevadaplano is a small unincorporated community located in southwest Texas in the United States. It is located in Presidio County and is part of the Big Bend region of the state. The population is estimated at about 450 people. The community is situated at an elevation of 1,248 feet (380 m) above sea level. The community was founded in the late 19th century and was named for the Nevada-Colorado river that runs through the area. The community was originally a farming and ranching center, but over time became the gateway to Big Bend Country due to its proximity to Big Bend National Park. The Nevadaplano area is known for its natural beauty and outdoor recreational opportunities. The area boasts numerous hiking trails and biking trails. The state park of Big Bend National Park is nearby, as are Devils River State Natural Area and Elephant Mountain Wildlife Management Area. Tourists often drive in from Austin, El Paso, and other parts of Texas to explore the area’s many outdoor activities, especially in the summer months. Nevadaplano is also known for its signature cuisine. The community’s restaurants serve up traditional Mexican dishes, as well as traditional American fare. Visitors will also find a variety of Tex-Mex dishes on the menu. The area is served by several primary roads, including Interstate 10, US Route 90, and State Highway 111. Locally operated businesses offer employment opportunities and general services to the residents of Nevadaplano and the surrounding areas. The local school district operates several schools, including Nevadaplano Elementary School, Nevadaplano High School, and Nevadaplano Junior High School.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Copenhagen Fire of 1795\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Copenhagen Fire of 1795 (Københavns brandes 1795) started on Friday, 5 June 1795, at or around 3 pm by the Navy's old base south east of Kongens Nytorv on Gammelholm, in the Navy's magazine for coal and timber, the so-called Dellehave. As the workers had already gone home, a considerable length of time passed before efforts to combat the fire started, and out of fear for theft, the fire hydrants had been removed. The people of Holmen also blocked the civilian fire brigade, possibly in the belief that since it was a military area, the military should take care of it.There had been an extended period without rain and the dry wood, combined with the storage of rope work and tar, made the fire spread quickly. The wind blew especially strong from east-southeast, and that meant the countless embers were carried through the air into the city. Because of the strong sunlight, small fires were difficult to detect until they have taken hold. This is why the fire spread from Gammelholm to the main magazine along Holmens Canal (Holmens Kanal Danish) and over Holmens Canal to the quarter around Saint Nicolai Church and from there, along Gammel Strand to the area around Nytorv/Gammeltorv.The fire at Nicolai ChurchRight by Saint Nicolai Church, after the Copenhagen Fire of 1728, infrastructure to fight fires had been constructed because the area was very densely built up. A basin that could hold 400 barrels of water had been excavated for use. In addition, a pumping station was built that could pump water through an 800-foot-long hose. The pumps were able to raise the pressure to such a level that it could deliver one barrel of water per minute from the hose. But when a spark set fire to the church tower, nobody could find the key to the door of the pumping station. Only some time later did anyone think of kicking the door in. By then, the fire had already taken hold and the residents in the surrounding quarter were panicked. The road became so full of people, who were also transporting furniture to safety from the fire, that the water hoses could not be brought close to the fire. Soon the church burned to the ground, and with it the pumps. At that point, the Saint Nicolai quarter could not be saved.Fighting the fireThe majority of the residents in the area threatened by the fire chose to flee, but in some places residents chose to stay in their houses and fight the fire. This happened in the first three to four houses on the north side of Østergade. Here people spread themselves throughout the houses both inside and out, armed with buckets and plenty of water. This prevented the fire from taking hold and saved the neighbouring street of Købmagergade at the same time, since it would have inevitably have spread to there as well.The Conference Advisory, Carsten Anker, had his mansion on the corner of Vingårdsstræde and Kongens Nytorv saved by covering both it and a connected building with a sail that constantly had water poured on it.The Justice Advisory, Peter Uldall, saved his mansion in Vimmelskaftet by paying a large party to stay and put out any embers. It also prevented the fire from spreading to the northern side of the plaza, so only the southern side burned down.ConsequencesThe fire died out on Sunday, 7 July, around 4 pm. It had destroyed 909 houses and partially damaged 74. Just over 6,000 of the just under 100,000 residents in the capital were made homeless. A large number of them took refuge in the ruins of the recently burned-down Christianborgs Castle, the remaining walls of which were so large that an entire family could move into a window niche. The stables were also used as housing.The fire had, together with Copenhagen's fire of 1728, in effect burned down almost the whole of Copenhagen's medieval and Renaissance heritage and so only a few houses from before the 18th century remain in that part of the city. More historic buildings in Copenhagen would be lost to fire in 1807 when the city was bombarded by the British.The fire was a strong contributing factor to the foundation of Denmark's first credit institution, Kreditkassen for Husejerne i Kjøbenhavn, in 1797.After the fire, a large-scale plan was designed by the city planner Jørgen Henrich Rawert and the construction master Peter Meyn. The plan dictated the newly constructed houses should be made of masonry (instead of being timber framed) and house corners at intersections should be diagonal and the streets straightened so that the fire department's long ladder companies could navigate the streets more easily.ReferencesFires in Copenhagen 18th-century fires 1795 disasters 1795 in Denmark 1795 Urban fires in Europe 18th century in Copenhagen", "machine_text": " The Copenhagen Fire of 1795 (Danish: Københavns Brand) was a large city-wide fire in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1795. The fire began on 25 June 1795, between 2 and 3am. It broke out in two separate places within Copenhagen’s city walls, in both Christianshavn and Vesterbro. It is thought that the flames were caused by faulty cookstoves, but no official investigation was ever conducted. Fire engines of the day were inadequate to handle the scale of the blaze, and the wind quickly spread the flames across both districts. By the time the fire was extinguished, it had destroyed 1709 buildings, leaving an area of smouldering rubble with a breadth of 4km in the heart of Copenhagen. Thousands of people were displaced, and while no casualties were reported, some residents who had been too slow to evacuate perished in the flames. In total, the economic impact of the fire included damages estimated at 3.2 million rixdollars, of which 800,000 fell to the state, and the rest to unprotected individuals and corporations. The fire brought about a shift in urban lighting regulations. Streets were to be kept lit from the end of October until the morning of May, greatly reducing instances of fires fuelled by negligence. A new fire brigade was also organized, and funds were put in place to help rebuild the affected areas. In the weeks following the fire, Christian VII and his court decided to visit the ruins of the fire and this marked the beginning of a period of rebuilding and recovery for the city. The rebuilding effort was marked by a number of royal decrees, including one for the rebuilding of churches, with a greater emphasis on fireproof measures. Today, the fire is remembered in several places throughout Copenhagen. A memorial to the victims was erected in 1902 in Israels Plads, while several streets in the area still bear the names of craftsmen who lost their livelihoods in the fire. In addition, an annual procession is held on the anniversary of the fire in the Vesterbro district of Copenhagen, in which citizens commemorate the event with a candlelight parade. Overall, the Copenhagen Fire of 1795 was a tragedy for the people of Copenhagen and their communities, but it also brought about important changes to Danish city planning, fire regulations and public safety policies. Today, the event is marked with a respect and understanding for the lessons it taught.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 4513354}

Latter-day Saint servicemen from the United States were the first to bring the LDS Church's teachings to the area.The first church's missionaries arrived in South Korea in 1954. Some years later, church apostle Boyd K. Packer was assigned to travel to South Korea and find a place in which to build a temple. After considering several locations, Packer eventually chose the property which the church had purchased almost two decades earlier. In 1981, the announcement was made for a temple in Seoul.Gordon B.

It consisted of the forces of five states: the Great Qing Dynasty, the Kingdom of Ryukyu, the Kingdom of Siam, the Kingdom of Annam and the Korean Joseon Dynasty. The force was in response to a rapidly expanding imperial Japan which, during the mid-19th century, had acquired a considerable amount of territory in East Asia, as well as a considerable naval presence on the seas of East Asia. The Armies of Death were formed as a unified defense against Japanese aggression, primarily in the form of attacks on any of the five member states. The Armies of Death were composed mainly of infantry, cavalry and some artillery, with the Qing Dynasty typically contributing the bulk of the forces. The Kingdom of Siam and the Kingdom of Annam provided naval forces, particularly to defend the Ryukyu Islands and the coast of China. The forces' ability to repel Japanese forces varied, largely dependent on the strength and morale of the forces themselves as well as the skill of their commanders. In 1876, the Armies of Death scored its only major success against the Japanese, at the Battle of Chi-Bi, where they defeated the Japanese forces led by General Satsuma Gi-In. This marked an unexpected reversal of fortunes and was seen as a major victory for the Armies of Death. However, it would not be long before the superior capabilities of the Japanese forces began to take their toll. In the following years, the five armies suffered a string of defeats, ultimately leading to the dissolution of the Armies of Death in 1887. The alliance effectively ended with the total absence of a unified command and, crucially, the failure of any nation to take responsibility for the defense of the alliance. This consequently led to a weakening of the alliance, coupled with the material and strategic superiority of the Japanese forces.

It was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1937.Overview During the Edo period Tokugawa shogunate established ichirizuka on major roads, enabling calculation both of distance travelled and of the charge for transportation by kago or palanquin. These markers, comprising a pair of earthen mounds, denoted the distance in ri () to Nihonbashi, the 'Bridge of Japan', erected in Edo in 1603.They were typically planted with an enoki or Japanese red pine to provide shelter for travelers. Since the Meiji period, most of the ichirizuka have disappeared, having been destroyed by the elements, modern highway construction and urban encroachment. In 1876, the 'Ichirizuka Abolition decree' was issued by the Meiji government and many were demolished at that time. Currently, 17 surviving ichirizuka are designated as national historic sites.In the case of the Ōhira ichirizuka, the mounds flank the Tōkaidō which connected Edo with Kyoto, between the post stations of Okazaki-juku and Fujikawa-juku. The surrounding lands around this marker were tenryō territory, administered from the nearby Ohira daikansho, and the local magistrate, Honda Narishige, supervised the construction. The northern mound was destroyed in 1928 due to road construction work, and only the southern mound was preserved. The mound is approximately 2.4 meters in height and 7.6 to 8.5 meters in diameter. An Enoki tree was planted by the mound at the time of its construction, but this tree was destroyed by a typhoon in 1958, and the tree presently on the mound is its replacement.See also List of Historic Sites of Japan (Aichi)ReferencesExternal links Okazaki city official site Okazaki tourism home pageIchirizuka Okazaki, Aichi Historic Sites of Japan History of Aichi Prefecture Mikawa Province", "machine_text": " Ōhira Ichirizuka (大平一里塚) is a historical monument located in Ōhira, Miyagi Prefecture, Japan.

The earth and stone embankment, measuring roughly 30 meters in length and 10 meters in width, was built during the Heian period (794–1185). It is thought to have been part of a system for protecting villages by creating a defense line against predators or other dangers. The embankment sits atop a hill at the edge of the village, just below a castle that was believed to date back to the Sengoku period (1467–1573). While the castle itself has been destroyed, the embankment is still visible and is considered to be a valuable representation of the ancient defense system used in Japan. Today, Ōhira Ichirizuka is maintained by the local government and is open to the public. It is a popular tourist attraction, with visitors coming to view the scenic view of the surrounding mountains and countryside. The site is also a popular spot for wedding photos. Nearby Ōhira Ichirizuka, two monuments have been erected in memory of the lives lost in the 2004 tsunami. The monuments, both made of stone, are referred to as the “Sendai Soul Memorial Tower” and the “Yokohama Soul Memorial Tower”. In addition to its importance as a historical landmark, Ōhira Ichirizuka is also recognized as a symbol of hope and resilience in the face of hardship.

It can be seen as an aspect of Romanticism and a reaction against Neoclassicism, which was coming to an end at the end of the Consulate, and became particularly associated with Josephine Bonaparte and Caroline Ferdinande Louise, duchesse de Berry.In architecture the style was an exuberant French equivalent to the Gothic Revival of the Germanic and Anglophone countries.The style related to contemporary developments in French literature, and music, but the term is usually restricted to painting and architecture.HistoryThe rediscovery of medieval civilization was one of the intellectual curiosities of the beginning of the 19th century, with much input from the Ancien Régime and its institutions, rites (the coronation ceremony dated back to the 16th century) and the medieval churches in which family ceremonies occurred.Even while exhuming the remains of the kings and putting on the market a multitude of objects, works of art and elements of medieval architecture, the revolutionaries brought them back to life, it could be said.The Musée des Monuments français (Museum of French Monuments), established in the former convent that would become Paris's École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts, presented all this glorious debris of the Middle Ages as subjects of admiration for the public and as models of inspiration for students of the departments of engraving, painting and sculpture, but not those of architecture since teaching of this subject had been dissociated from the 'beaux-arts' and placed in the École centrale des travaux publics under the direction of J.N.L Durand, a harsh promoter of the neoclassical architecture that characterized the styles of the Convention and Consulate.Later, from the Bourbon Restoration and under the impulse of Quatremère de Quincy and Mérimée, a new tradition of teaching architecture put it back under the fine arts umbrella, in the margins of the declining official school, beginning with private workshops that behaved as diocesan architects working for historic monuments that would give rise to the Société Centrale des Architectes and make Troubador-style architecture possible.The resurgence of Christian feeling and in Christianity in the arts, with the publication in 1800 of Le Génie du Christianisme ('the Genius of Christianity'), played a major role in favour of edifying painting, sculpture and literature, often inspired by religion.Artists and writers rejected the neo-antique rationalism of the French Revolution and turned towards a perceived glorious Christian past.The progress of the history and archaeology in the course of the 18th century began to bear fruit, at first, in painting.Paradoxically these painters of the past were unaware of the primitives of French painting, finding it too academic and not sufficiently filled with anecdote.Napoleon himself did not disdain this artistic current: he took as his emblem the golden beehive on the grave of the Merovingian king Childeric I, rediscovered in the 17th century, and saw himself as the heir of the French monarchy.He also gave official recognition to the Middle Ages in the forms of his coronation, and tried to profit from other trappings of the medieval French kings, perhaps even their miraculous curative powers (Bonaparte visiting the plague-victims of Jaffa by Antoine-Jean Gros was read as a modern re-envisgaing of the thaumaturgical kings).Literature Public interest in the Middle Ages in literature first manifested itself in France and above all England. In France, this came with the adaptation and publication from 1778 of ancient chivalric romances by the Comte de Tressan (1707–1783) in his Bibliothèque des romans, and in England with the first fantastical romances and gothic novels, such as The Castle of Otranto (1764). These English romances inspired late 18th-century French writers to follow suit, such as Donatien de Sade with his Histoire secrete d'Isabelle de Baviere, reine de France. The Le Troubadour, poésies occitaniques (1803) by Fabre d'Olivet popularized the term, and may have led to the naming of the style in art. The Waverley Novels of Walter Scott were hugely popular across Europe, and a major influence on both painting and French novelists such as Alexandre Dumas and Victor Hugo.PaintingIn painting, the troubadour style was represented by history painting portraying edifying historical episodes, often borrowing its smoothness, its minute and illusionistic description of detail, its rendering of fabrics, the intimate character of its familiar scenes and its other technical means from Dutch Golden Age painting. The paintings were typically rather small cabinet paintings, often showing quiet intimate anecdotal moments rather than moments of high drama, though these were both depicted. As well as figures from political history, famous artists and authors of the past were often shown, especially Raphael and Dante.Ingres' Death of Leonardo da Vinci in the arms of King Francois I of France is one of several works bringing rulers and artists together. A number of paintings by Ingres are in the style, and lesser artists such as Pierre-Henri Révoil (1776–1842) and Fleury-François Richard (1777–1852) specialized in the style. The Belgian Henri Leys painted in a more sombre version of the style much influenced by Northern Renaissance painting. Richard Parkes Bonington is better remembered for his landscapes, but also painted in the style, as did Eugène Delacroix. The peak period was brought to an end by the Revolution of 1848, and later the arrival of Realism, although the style arguably merged into late 19th-century academic painting. The transition can be seen in the work of Paul Delaroche.Arguably the first troubadour painting was presented at the Salon of 1802, under the French Consulate.It was a work by Fleury-Richard, Valentine of Milan weeping for the death of her husband, a subject which had come to the artist during a visit to the 'musée des monuments français', a museum of French medieval monuments.A tomb from this museum was included in the painting as that of the wife.Thanks to its moving subject matter, the painting was an enormous success – seeing it, David cried 'This resembles nothing anyone else has done, it's a new effect of colour; the figure is charming and full of expression, and this green curtain thrown across this window renders the illusion complete'.Compositions lit from the back of the scene, with the foreground in semi-darkness, became rather a trademark of the early years of the style.Fragonard's painting ofFrançois Premier reçu chevalier par Bayard (Francis I knighted by Bayard, Salon of 1819) has to be read not as a rediscovery of a medieval past, but as a memory of a recent monarchic tradition.ExamplesPierre-Nolasque Bergeret, Aretino in the studio of Tintoretto, Salon of 1822.Madame Cheradame, née Bertaud, The Education of Saint Louis.Michel Martin Drölling, The Last Communion of Marie-Antoinette, Paris, Conciergerie.Louis Ducis, Le Tasse reading a passage from his poem Jerusalem Delivered to Princess Éléonore d’Este, formerly in the collection of the Empress Joséphine.

It can be seen as overly sentimental or unrealistically nostalgic, treating its subjects in a way 'later associated with Hollywood costume dramas.To its proponents, the archaic details were regarded as a rallying cry for a new, localized nationalism, purged of classical (or neo-classical) and Roman influence.The small size of many of the canvases was considered a reference to Northern, primitive painting, devoid of Italian influence. To others, the small canvas sizes represent the artworks' insignificance and lack of vigor. All the brass, gilding, carving and inlaid historical detail of the headboards of the world could not redeem such objects as anything other than interior decoration.ArchitectureA fashion for medieval architecture may be seen throughout 19th century Europe, originating in England, and a blooming of the Neogothic style, but in France this remains limited to certain 'feudal' buildings in the parks surrounding châteaux.After the Troubadour style disappeared in painting, around the time of the 1848 French Revolution, it continued (or re-emerged) in architecture, the decorative arts, literature and theatre.Troubador buildingsChâteau de Maulmont at Saint-Priest-de-Bramefant, architect Pierre-François-Léonard Fontaine, formerly a hunting lodge on the royal domain of Randan which was one of Louis-Philippe of France's residences.Gallerie Saint-Louis, Palais de justice de Paris, built in 1835 by Gisors (1796–1866), in place of a gothic gallery he had demolished.Château de Pierrefonds, Eugène Viollet-le-Duc architect.Château d'Aulteribe, at Semantizon, rebuilt by Henriette Onslow, daughter of the musician George Onslow.Château du Barry, at Lévignac, a Neo-Gothic wing, by the brothers Auguste Virebentand Pascal Virebent (1745–1831), architects in Toulouse.Château de la Rochepot, reconstruction by Marie Pauline Cécile Dupond-White (1841–1898), widow Sadi-Carnot.Château de Clavières-Ayrens, at Ayrens, built by Ernest de La Salle de RochemaureDecorative artsHorloge au troubadour, in the Empire-troubadour style, 1810, by Masure à ÉtampesService à chocolat Du Gesclin, Manufacture de Sèvres, cartoon by Alexandre-Évariste Fragonard (1780–1850)NotesReferences Palmer, Allison Lee, Historical Dictionary of Romantic Art and Architecture, pp. 219–220, 2011, Scarecrow Press, , 780810874732, google booksBibliographyAux sources de l'ethnologie française, l'Académie celtique, 1995, Nicole Belmont.

Its origin is unknown and is often associated with the genre of traditional folk music, but it can also encompass a wide range of styles including courtly love songs, troubadours, church music, and even courtly secular music. Troubadour style songs usually contain lyrics with a focus on courtly love and chivalry. Troubadour style became popular throughout Europe during the 12th and 13th centuries. It was used by French troubadours, a group of travelling minstrels and poets whose songs often were about unrequited love, courtly love, or religious devotion. Troubadours were popular in courts and castles, where they performed their songs for the nobility. The style spread across Europe and other regions in the world, including Spain and northern Africa, influencing the development of many other genres of music. The characteristic that distinguishes troubadour style is its use of polyphony. This technique involves the use of two or more voices singing different melodies simultaneously, creating a unique and complex sound. Troubadours typically used a single voice accompanied by a stringed instrument such as a harp, lute, or cittern. The melodies were typically lyrical, conveying strong emotional content. Often, there was a singing interlude called a refrain, which served to connect the different verses of a song. Aside from its use in music, the term “troubadour style” has also been used in literature, particularly in the works of medieval authors such as Geoffrey Chaucer and Geoffrey of Monmouth. These authors made use of the troubadour style in describing the activities and events of their characters, particularly romantic interactions. Troubadour style remains popular to this day, largely due to its strong emotional content. Many contemporary musicians and singers continue to perform songs in the troubadour style, using modern instruments such as electric and acoustic guitars. Others also incorporate this style into their own music, incorporating traditional elements into modern genres. For example, traditional folk and country singer-songwriters often blend the troubadour style with more contemporary influences.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 9875904}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"NDUFAF5\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex assembly factor 5, also known as Arginine-hydroxylase NDUFAF5, or Putative methyltransferase NDUFAF5, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the NDUFAF5 gene. The NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex (complex I) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain catalyzes the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, and consists of at least 43 subunits. The complex is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This gene encodes a mitochondrial protein that is associated with the matrix face of the mitochondrial inner membrane and is required for complex I assembly. A mutation in this gene results in mitochondrial complex I deficiency. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.StructureNDUFAF5 is located on the p arm of Chromosome 20 in position 12.1 and spans 36,554 base pairs. The NDUFAF5 gene produces a 30 kDa protein composed of 267 amino acids. The presumed structure of the c-terminal of the protein has been found to resemble that of the known secondary structure of RdmB. NDUFAF5 contains the S-adenosylmethionine dependent methyltransferase domain, which contains the GxGxG signature sequence, and the S-adenosylmethionine-binding motif which are common in most SAM-dependent methyltransferases. This arginine-hydroxylase is involved in the assembly of mitochondrial NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex (complex I, MT-ND1) at early stages. Complex I is composed of 45 evolutionally conserved core subunits, including both mitochondrial DNA and nuclear encoded subunits. One of its arms is embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondria, and the other is embedded in the organelle. The two arms are arranged in an L-shaped manner. The total molecular weight of the complex is 1MDa.FunctionThe NDUFAF5 gene encodes a mitochondrial protein that is associated with the matrix face of the mitochondrial inner membrane and is required for complex I assembly. Their role is integral to co-factor insertions and in utilizing sub-assemblies for building complex I. It does so by catalyzing the hydroxylation of Arg-73 in the NDUFS7 subunit of human complex I, which occurs before the peripheral and membrane arm juncture formation in the beginning stages of complex I assembly. The NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex (complex I) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain catalyzes the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, and consists of at least 43 subunits. The complex is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Though the exact biochemical function of NDUFAF5 is not yet known, mutations in this gene results in mitochondrial complex I deficiency. NDUFAF5 is also known to be a member of the 7β-strand family of SAM-dependent methyltransferases.Clinical significanceMutations in NDUFAF5 is known to result in mitochondrial diseases and associated disorders. It is majorly associated with a complex I deficiency, a deficiency in the first complex of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Suppression of the NDUFAF5 gene has been found to lead to the loss of both peripheral and membrane arms of complex I associated with NDUFS7 and ND1. This then leads to the progressive loss of complex I, causing the deficiency. Such disorders involving the dysfunction of the mitochondrial respiratory chain may cause a wide range of clinical manifestations from lethal neonatal disease to adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders. Phenotypes include macrocephaly with progressive leukodystrophy, non-specific encephalopathy, cardiomyopathy, myopathy, liver disease, Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, and some forms of Parkinson disease. Mutations in NDUFAF5 has also been common patients with Leigh syndrome, an early-onset progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the presence of focal, bilateral lesions.InteractionsIn addition to co-subunits for complex I, NDUFAF5 has protein-protein interactions with NDUFAF8 (for stabilization), and NDUFS7.ReferencesFurther readingHuman proteins Genes on human chromosome 20", "machine_text": ". NDUFAF5 is a mitochondrial outer membrane protein found in humans and other animals. It is a member of the NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase family of proteins and is integral to the mitochondrial electron transport chain and function as part of the electron transfer system within the inner mitochondrial membrane. The protein is encoded by the NDUFAF5 gene and is thought to play an important role in mitochondrial energy production. The NDUFAF5 gene, located on the short arm of chromosome 12, consists of four exons, and encodes an outer-membrane protein of the same name. This gene has been linked to a mutation in the human NDUFAF5 gene associated with Leigh Syndrome. Leigh Syndrome is a severe neurological disorder which is caused by a defect in mitochondrial respiratory chain function. NDUFAF5 is a member of the NADH-ubiquinone Oxidoreductase family and, like all members of this family, it is a component of the electron transfer system within the inner mitochondrial membrane. This protein is involved in the transfer of electrons from NADH to the ubiquinone pool, and therefore plays an important role in energy production within the mitochondria. Functionally, NDUFAF5 has been shown to have an essential role in the assembly of the respiratory complex I. Specifically, it acts as a scaffold protein which binds the iron-sulfur clusters of the complex to the membrane at the interface. As such, NDUFAF5 is thought to be important for the efficient assembly of complex I and for its proper functioning. In addition to the role that NDUFAF5 plays in the assembly of complex I, it has been suggested to play a regulatory role in this evolutionary ancient enzymatic pathway. Specifically, it has been proposed that the interaction of NDUFAF5 with complex I is partially regulated by post-translational modification of NDUFAF5, suggesting that it may play a role in controlling the levels of complex I assembly and its activity. Overall, NDUFAF5 is an important mitochondrial membrane protein involved in electron transport, energy production and complex I assembly. Furthermore, the mutation of this gene has been suggested to result in Leigh Syndrome, highlighting the importance of NDUFAF5 in the healthy functioning of cells and organisms.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 58004903}

Notably, the normally vocal audience were unusually silenced by a wordless version of their signature teacup act.Their first full show at the Battersea Arts Centre was as part of the London International Mime Festival in January 1985, their first theatre show, sub-titled, 'Juggling With A Social Conscience'.They subsequently toured internationally for ten years playing in theatres notable to Africa, South America, Australia and extensively in Europe. Their show under the joint Artistic Direction of David Spathaky and Sue Broadway combined the ethos of 'alternative' comedy of the 1980 with a 1970s revival of circus skills, variously called 'Neo-circus or new variety by them or New Circus' by other people, it largely promoted a reinvention of circus focusing on human skill and generally without presenting animal acts. Their background in street performing, The Amazing Mendezies and in the influential Circus Oz (of which Sue Broadway was a founding member) gave the show an irreverent, fast-paced, surrealist feel.ProductionsThey produced several different shows and were occasionally given some financial support in the UK by the Arts Council and other grants. They also produced several large scale community shows, were touring two shows at the same time in the early 1990s and created jobs for more than twenty five people simultaneously during production periods.They notably adhered to a political commitment of a balance of men and women on stage and off and of equal pay for all company members throughout their existence.Shows included:Juggling With A Social Conscience. My Life on a Plate of Toast — Several versions - chamber circus 4 people on stage Domestic Bliss - a touring seven person theatre circus show Stop Laughing This Is Serious - touring 7 person theatre circus show Fabulous Beasts - touring seven person theatre circus show Gravity Swing- touring seven person theatre circus show Angels and Amazons - all woman 3 person clown show Swan - a community circus White Snake - A large scale community circus opera (50 performers) combining professional and non professional performers, trainers from China, original libretto and commissioned music. Cabinet of Curiosities - A 'chamber circus' - 4 people on stage Broadway Belles - All women cabaret show The Mast - a site specific outdoor aerial rig at the Albany Empire in Deptford and the Henley Regatta. The Plymouth Theatre Royal Cleaners - a commissioned intervention at a patrons end of season party.InfluenceRa-Ra Zoo was influenced by the agitprop and political theatre of the late 1960s and early 70's and the ritual theatre and 'Happenings' associated with the time notably the 'Grand Magic Circus', 'Circus Oz, 'The People Show', 'Cunning Stunts, 'The Festival of Fools' in Amsterdam and the German choreographer Pina Bausch. Political influence came from the 1970s wave of the feminist movement and direct action politics such as the protests at Greenham Common in the UK and the resurgence of 'theatre' as political activism.Ra-Ra Zoo influenced in turn many others as the company employed over a hundred people during its existence and played to many thousands of people worldwide. They spawned and encouraged, directly and indirectly, many offshoots including The Circus Space, (now NCCA) The Gandini Juggling Project, The Flying Gorillas, No Ordinary Angels, Le La Les, Broadway and Co., and Stretch People.Founder Sue Broadwayreturned to lead Circus Ozas Artistic Director and helped direct the circus elements of the Sydney Olympics opening ceremony.Founder Dave Spathaky was in semi retirement from 1994 but after surgery in 2008 is producing and occasionally performing as The Great Davido. Founder Stephen Kent is a renowned musician and alongside his performing hosts a weekly radio show of world music.Mark Digby and Ali Houiellebecq who met while in RRZ and formed 'La le les' which toured successfully for many years.Longtime member Lindsey Butcher, dancer, juggler and aerialist subsequently formed GravityLevity.Sean Gandini and Kati Ylä-Hokkala left Ra-Ra Zoo in 1992 to form the Gandini JugglingMedia Visibility Although generally politically opposed to recorded media, the company performed on television on programs for young people such as 'No. 73', Blue Peter, guest spots on 'The Late Late Show' and elsewhere. They also featured on a broadcast pilot for C4 with Spike Milligan 'The Last Laugh before TVAM'. Dave Spathaky and Sue Broadway appeared together on TV shows worldwide, several times successfully beating their own world plate-spinning record.Early Days In early days they played on the emerging 'New Variety' and alternative cabaret circuit and were the very first performers on stage at the newly reopened Hackney Empire in East London on 9 December 1986. They subsequently played several successful seasons there with their full-length shows.World Touring Their extensive touring was sometimes partly funded by the British Council but also self-produced. They represented the UK at World Expos in Vancouver, Canada, in 1986 and in Brisbane, Australia, in 1988.Death or Resurrection?Ra-Ra Zoo's last full show to date 'Cabinet of Curiosities' toured in 1993/4 and like their first full show (in 1995) was in the London International Mime Festival (in 1994), the last show of that tour was at the Liverpool Everyman also in 1994.Reprise In 2011 founders Dave Spathaky, Sue Broadway (with musician Thom Podgoretsky) performed at The Cork Midsummer Festival and the Glastonbury Festival but have currently no plans for new Ra-Ra Zoo productions in the pipelines but an online project in 2020called 'Clown Power Live' at:  during the anthropause, contain collaborative elements between Sue BroadwayDave Spathaky.ReferencesTheatre companies in England Edinburgh Festival performers", "machine_text": " Ra-Ra Zoo, also known as the Ra-Ra Royal Circus, is an Australian based circus and entertainment company founded in 2012 and based in Melbourne, Australia.

He was born in Copenhagen, Denmark in 1872 and trained at the Royal Danish Ballet from 1881 until 1897. He made his debut in 1891 in a minor role in Denmark's Royal Theatre during the birthday celebration of King Christian IX. He soon rose to become one of the most important figures at the theatre, often appearing in leading roles. He achieved fame performing roles in the works of August Bournonville, the great Danish choreographer. In 1898, Henri was invited by Danish-born ballet director and teacher, Émile Jaques-Dalcroze, to become head of dance at his new ballet school of the same name in Geneva. During his time as director, Nathansen created several ballets, most notably La rose et le Rameau (1901) and Carmen (1910). In 1918, he moved from Geneva to Paris, where he was hired as a ballet master at the Paris Opera. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, he created several ballets for the Paris Opera, including Dream of a Summer Night (1921), The Blue Bird (1923). Henri also choreographed ballets for both the Paris Opéra Ballet and the Royal Danish Theatre. Henri was equally committed not only to the Paris Ballet, but also to the advancement of ballet in Scandinavia. He founded the Nathansen Ballet School in Copenhagen in 1922, which remains an important centre for the development of Danish ballet today. He also opened a school in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1925 and actively recruited and encouraged Swedish and Danish dancers to come to France and train at the Paris Opera Ballet. Nathansen was a great innovator and teacher. He is credited with helping to introduce modern dance steps and technique to the Paris opera repertoire, broadening the vocabulary of classical ballet. These breakthroughs signaled the beginning of a new era in ballet, ushering in some of the greatest ballets ever created.

As First Lord, the Earl of Egmont presided over a period of great expansion in the Royal Navy, and worked to improve the navy’s response to Napoleonic France. On his orders, in 1783, the Royal Navy was sent to the Caribbean to protect British possessions from attack. During his tenure, the navy underwent a major reorganization, which included the addition of more ships, increased manpower, and greater discipline among officers and enlisted sailors. He retired from the Admiralty in 1800, citing ill health and citing the ongoing Napoleonic Wars. He was succeeded as First Lord of the Admiralty by Lord Barham.

He is Rosh Yeshiva of Yeshivat Hesder Amit Orot Shaul in Tel Aviv, Israel. Cherlow was one of the founders of Tzohar, an organization of religious Zionist Orthodox rabbis in Israel.BiographyYuval Cherlow was born in Herzliya, Israel. His parents were American-Jewish immigrants who moved to Israel in 1949. He was educated in Yeshivat Har Etzion. As part of his Hesder studies, he served as an armor officer in the IDF. In the reserves he was a company commander in the armoured corps. He lives in Efrat with his wife, who is a lecturer in the department of Jewish philosophy in Bar Ilan University.Rabbinic careerCherlow's rabbinic career began in Kibbutz Tirat Tzvi, where he served as a rabbi and teacher. Later he served as a rabbi in Yeshivat HaGolan in Hispin, in the southern Golan Heights. After the Rabin assassination, he helped found Tzohar, whose aim was to lessen the tensions between religious and non-religious communities. In 1998 he founded a Yeshivat Hesder in Petach Tikva, later to become Yeshivat Hesder Amit Orot Shaul in Kfar Batya, Raanana. He justified his decision to start a new yeshiva in the central area of Israel by saying that it is the place where the most important debates about the identity of the country take place.Since 2001 Cherlow has answered more than 30,000 questions about Halakha and other issues related to Judaism via the Moreshet website. He published two books based on his internet responsa. He has also published books that deal with Bible commentary as well as the writings of Rabbi Avraham Yitzhak Kook.Cherlow is a member of the ethics committee of the Israeli Ministry of Health and the committee which allocates the budget for new drugs. He is active in the BeMaagalei Tzedek ('Circles of Justice') movement. In 2011, he took part in the Israeli social justice protests.Views and opinionsCherlow has voiced empathy for the difficulties faced by religious homosexual people, and has called for the Orthodox community to treat them with compassion. However, he still maintains that homosexual relationships are prohibited by Halakha. Cherlow has voiced liberal positions on some issues, such as allowing the use of artificial insemination by unmarried women in certain circumstances and supporting coed activities in Bnei Akiva. His view on Jewish marriage in Israel is that all Jews should be married according to Halakha, but if the Chief Rabbinate refuses to marry a couple, there should be an alternate method of being recognized as a couple according to secular law. He is opposed to civil disobedience, an issue that rose to the fore during Israel's unilateral disengagement from Gaza and evacuation of Israeli settlements in the region.In 2012, Cherlow called on the State of Israel to recognise non-Orthodox streams of Judaism and Reform conversions. In response, Tzohar distanced itself from his remarks. Yizhar Hess of the Masorti Movement in Israel has suggested that Cherlow does not represent the mainstream of Zionist Orthodoxy in Israel, and Rabbi Yehoshua Shapira described Cherlow as a 'neo-Reform rabbi in the Orthodox sector.'Cherlow is also interested in interfaith dialogue, and currently sits on the Board of World Religious Leaders for the Elijah Interfaith Institute.Rabbi Cherlow deals mainly with ethical issues. He writes articles and tweets about ethics in Israel. In 2015, he established the ethics department at Tzohar. His book 'BeTzalmo' (In His Image), published in 2015 by Maggid Press, deals with the religious meanings of God's image in people.In March of 2018 he garnered attention for stating that genetically cloned pig or any other animal would be Kosher.ReferencesExternal linksTzoharRabbi Cherlow's amazing journey outside the Israeli Orthodox ghettoIsraeli Jews Religious Zionist rosh yeshivas Israeli Orthodox rabbis 20th-century rabbis 21st-century rabbis Living people Israeli settlers 1957 births Israeli people of American-Jewish descent People from Herzliya Yeshivat Har Etzion", "machine_text": " Yuval Cherlow (born 1964) is an Israeli rabbi and posek (or decisor of Jewish law) from the Chareidi community.

During the 2002 season, Beckerman was UCLA's anchor on balance beam, averaging 9.77 over the year and winning individually six times.She was NCAA South Central Regional balance beam champion and Pac-10 balance beam champion, as well as earning a Pac-10 All-Academic honorable mention. On September 11, 2003, at the beginning of her senior year, Beckerman was dismissed from the UCLA team by coach Valorie Kondos Field. Kondos Field claimed that the dismissal was due to Beckerman's performance in training and unenthusiastic attitude, although Beckerman disputed those allegations. Beckerman was stripped of her athletic scholarship and housing, but completed her degree. In 2020, following widespread public discussion on social media under the hashtag '#gymnastalliance' of allegations by gymnasts of an abusive gymnastics culture that rewarded coaches who damaged and belittled gymnasts, Beckerman posted an open letter to Ms Kondos Field on social media where she related her experiences of competing at UCLA.Post-gymnastics careerAs of 2018, Beckerman owns a music school and works as an emergency medical technician in New Jersey. In a 2018 interview after the USA gymnastics abuse scandal became public, Beckerman expressed that she was 'leaning toward' favoring the dissolution of USA Gymnastics because 'the structure needs to be changed completely so obedience isn't the desired outcome.' She said:'When [a coach] has so much control, it puts a young person in a mindset that the coach has more authority than anyone else in their life - that they should put all their faith in them...There's a fine line between...where the culture is healthy, to a culture of silence...[In elite gymnastics, gymnasts] were not allowed to speak...That does a lot to you, psychologically. You try to be as meek and as serious as possible. 'Stoic' was this huge compliment at [national training] camp. We all strived for that. Being someone who never complained was a compliment. So, you don't speak out, because it's ingrained in you that if you do, you have poor integrity, that you're a bad gymnast, a bad teammate. Asking questions [in elite gymnastics] is very taboo.'Personal lifeBeckerman was born in Long Branch, New Jersey to Howard and Melanie Beckerman. She has two brothers and is the middle sibling. Beckerman grew up in Middletown Township, New Jersey, where she attended Middletown High School South. In 2014, she married Matthew King.ReferencesExternal links Beckerman gymnastic biography UCLA Player bio1981 births Living people American female artistic gymnasts Jewish American sportspeople Jewish gymnasts Middletown High School South alumni UCLA Bruins women's gymnasts Sportspeople from Long Branch, New Jersey People from Middletown Township, New Jersey People from Wyoming, Ohio Sportspeople from the Cincinnati metropolitan area Sportspeople from the New York metropolitan area Pan American Games medalists in gymnastics Pan American Games silver medalists for the United States U.S. women's national team gymnasts Gymnasts at the 1999 Pan American Games 21st-century American Jews 21st-century American women", "machine_text": " Alyssa Beckerman (born December 15, 1975) is an American author, public speaker, editor, and filmmaker.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Ruth Cardoso\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Ruth Vilaça Correia Leite Cardoso (September 19, 1930 – June 24, 2008) was a Brazilian anthropologist and a former member of the Faculty of Philosophy, Letters and Human Sciences at the University of São Paulo (FFLCH-USP). She was the wife of 34th President of Brazil, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, and First Lady of her country between January 1, 1995 to December 31, 2002. She too was a Ph.D in anthropology from the University of São Paulo.As professor and researcher Cardoso taught at the Latin American College of Social Sciences (Flacso/Unesco), University of Chile (Santiago), Maison des Sciences de L'Homme (Paris), University of California, Berkeley, and Columbia University (New York City). She was an associate member of the Center for Latin American Studies of the University of Cambridge. With her husband, the sociologist and former president of Brazil, Fernando Henrique Cardoso,she founded and later directed the research institute Cebrap (Centro Brasileiro de Análise e Planejamento – Brazilian Center of Analysis and Planning), which continues to be a leading site of social science research in Brazil.Dr. Cardoso’s academic reputation rests primarily on a series of highly influential articles and book chapters on popular movements and political participation that she published in the 1980s and 1990s. Under Dr. Cardoso, Cebrap created Brazil’s first research group on social movements, helping to legitimate formal academic study of the 'new' (non-class) social movements that had emerged in the 1970s. At the same time, she was careful to stress the limits of identity-based and popular movements for political transformation, noting the divisions among them and their frequent dependency on clientelistic relations with the state and political parties.Unlike many academics, Dr. Cardoso also had the opportunity to put some of her theories into practice after her husband was elected president. She transformed the traditional charity approach of other first ladies with her Comunidade Solidária (Solidary Community) programs that stressed the role of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in state-society partnerships. In addition to executing concrete social programs, Comunidade Solidária also facilitated broad discussions of important social topics, from agrarian reform to the legal status of NGOs, publishing the results of these dialogues. Anthony Hall of the London School of Economics told the BBC after her death that she was instrumental in developing the plan to bundle various social programs together in the way that has become characteristic of the successful Bolsa Familia social program.She published a book about these experiences,Comunidade Solidaria: Fortalecendo a Sociedade, Promovendo O Desenvolvimento (Comunitas, 2002). She transformed the Comunidade Solidaria into an NGO, Comunitas, after her husband left office.She died in São Paulo on June 24, 2008, after suffering a cardiac arrest. She had been discharged from the Sírio-Libanês Hospital the previous day, June 23, 2008, having previously been admitted with chest pains.PublicationsBooksBibliografia Sobre a Juventude (with Helena Sampaio, Edusp, 1995)Comunidade Solidaria: Fortalecendo a Sociedade, Promovendo O Desenvolvimento (Comunitas, 2002)Articles and miscellaneous works1983: Movimentos Sociais Urbanos: Balanço Crítico.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Shams-ud-din Harifal\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Shams-ud-din Harifal (Urdu: ) was an (4 May 1944 - 14 March 1974) was an Islamic Sunni Hanafi scholar of the Deobandi school of thought and political leader of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam and Tehreek-e-Khatme-e-Nubuwwat. According to his biographer, Shams-ud-din's major contribution was his support of strong anti-Ahmadiyya feelings among Muslims at the risk and sacrifice of his life.Early life and educationHe was born on 4 May 1944 (21 Jumada al-awwal 1364 AH) in Balkh Province of Afghanistan to a family of religious scholars. His father Muhammad Zahid Harifal was a sufi theologian. He was the founder and teacher of the Madrasa Shams-uloom at Fort Sandeman in Zhob.Shams-ud-din received elementary religious education from his father. He continued both secular schooling and religious education.He matriculated from a government high school in Zhob in 1960. He then attended a madrassa boarding school in Akora Khattak, Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa. He stayed there for two years and continued his education under the guidance of Abdul Haq (father of Sami-ul-Haq, the chief of the JUI). He then attended the Madrasa Arabia New Town Karachi, where he studied under Muhammad Yousuf Binori for two consecutive years.He then went to Khanpur, Rahim Yar Khan and studied at the Madrasa Arabia Makhzan-ul-uloom wa fayuz Eidgah, headed by Pakistani religious scholar Abdullah Darkhawasti.Realizing the highest spiritual position of his teacher, he immediately became his spiritual student by taking the Bay'ah (oath of allegiance) of the Naqshbandi order of Sufism.After two years stay he proceeded to his last institution, the Madrasa Nasratul Uloom Gujranwala, to complete the remaining one-year course of Darse Nizami. At that madrasa, Shams-ud-din studied course of Hadiths (narrations of the words and deeds of Muhammad). He gained knowledge of tafseer, Hadith, spiritualism, mysticism, metaphysics, and logic. Thus completing a traditional Dars-i-Nizam course, he acquired his sanad (degree in Islamic knowledge and sciences of Hadith).After completing his graduation he returned to his native city of Zhob, where his father advised him to engage in revitalizing his madrasa. He became the patron of Madrasa, Shams-ul-Uloom following his father's wishes.Ancestral backgroundShams-ud-din belonged to the Harifal tribe. Shams-ud-din's forefather had been religious scholars for many generations. His first cousin, Obaid-ullah Khan Harifal, was the sardar (tribal chieftain) of the Harifal tribe. His grandfather, Muhammad Rafique, was a saint and had many disciples, as did his father. Another grandfather, Abdul Haq Harifal, had resisted British occupation, in present-day Shinghar.Political careerShams-ud-din was a member of Tehreek-e-Khatme Nabuwwat, which demanded the government of Pakistan declare Ahmadis as non-Muslims.During the general election of 1970, Shams-ud-din participated and contested the election at PB 10, Fort Sandeman (as Zhob was then known), on the platform of his political party Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam. He came in first in the election with 7,578 votes, more than double the total of the second-place finisher, Nawabzada Taimur Shah Jogezai, of the Muslim League (Qayyam), who received 3,726 Votes.On 2 May 1972, chairman Abdul Samad Khan Achakzai opened the first session of the Provincial Assembly of Balochistan, in the town hall, Quetta. During this session, Nawab Muhammad Khan Barozai of the National Awami Party (NAP) was elected as Speaker of Assembly. The very next day, 3 May 1972, Shams-ud-din was unanimously elected Deputy Speaker.(Ataullah Mengal had already been elected on 1 May as chief Minister.)It was a coalition government of NAP and JUI. Shams-ud-din was the youngest member of the assembly at age 28. Unfortunately, the assembly only lasted for ten months, before the Federal Government of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto dismissed the Provincial Government of Balochistan on 13 February 1973.Arrest On 15 July 1973, Shams-ud-din held a rally in Zarif Sheed Park, Zhob. He delivered a speech against the dissemination of tampered Qurans and literature in his native city, allegedly by Ahmadis. Tampering news inflamed the emotions of the people, which lead to riots and lynchings.Between 17 and 18 July 1973, Shams-ud-din's Zhob residence was cordoned off by a heavy contingent of Frontier Corps, who arrested him. The next morning, news of his arrest spread through the city, and tribesmen from all around blocked the outgoing roads to prevent him from being taken away. As the public protest grew out of control, authorities took him away by helicopter. This only further inflamed unrest all over the country.Several days after Shams-ud-din's disappearance, Mufti Mehmood demanded on the floor of the National Assembly that his whereabouts be revealed, even if he were dead. On that demand the Interior Minister Abdul Qayyum Khan confessed that Shams-ud-din was alive and in custody at Ma-wand (Kohlu) District, Balochistan. His arrest was controversial throughout the province.During his detention period, his father Muhammad Zahid Harifal received a message from then Governor Akbar Bugti, through his special emissary Saleh Muhammad, seeking a meeting at Quetta, so that the release of Shams-ud-dincould be worked out. Muhammad Zahid declined to accede to this proposal.A writ petition of habeas corpus was filed in Sindh-Balochistan High Court, Karachi, challenging his illegal confinement and petitioning for his release, on the premise that the prisoner had been detained incommunicado. Shams-ud-din was released on 18 August 1973. He received a grand reception when he returned to Zhob.A couple of days after his release, he held a rally in Central Jama Mosque, Zhob, and expressed his determination to go ahead with his mission.Meanwhile, his two colleagues, Saleh Muhammad Mardanzai of Muslim Bagh and Hassan Shah, who were elected on the JUI ticket, switched over to the ruling Pakistan People's party. Their actions conjured up illusions of victory in the minds of many hawkish politicians, who believed that Shams-ud-din would also switch parties. He was even offered the position of provincial Chief Minister as a reward, but refused.DeathIn the first week of March 1974, Shams-ud-din left Zhob for Quetta, and along with Muhammad Zaman Khan Achakzai (Provincial General Secretary of the JUI) called on the governor of Balochistan, Khan of Kalat Mir Ahmed Yar Khan, and conveyed him the message of Darkhawasti, and reminded him his commitment for implementing Islamic laws. The governor replied positively, stating, 'we seek your cooperation'.After his meeting with the governor, Shams-ud-din left Quetta for Khanpur, where he met with his mentor Darkhawasti, who prediction to Shams-ud-din, 'it could be our last meeting'. A few days prior, an attempt had been made on Darkhawasti's life at his official residence in Quetta and Darkhawasti was concerned.On 10 March 1974,Shams-ud-din addressed his last gathering near the vegetable market in Rahimyarkhan, Punjab Pakistan. Later that same day he left for Sibi and stayed overnight.On 13 March 1974, Shams-ud-din was driving home to Zhob along with one of his friends. On the way to Zhob, Shams-ud-din stopped in Akhterzai for his noon prayers. After prayers were over, Shams-ud-din resumed the drive. Thirty-five kilometers from Akhterzai, near a village called 'Khulgai' (Killa Saifullah District), where his friend shot him thrice in the head from behind the driver's seat.Later that same day, Malik Gul Hassan, who also happened to be on way to Zhob, saw an abandoned car on the side of the road and went to investigate. He found the body of Maulana Shams-ud-din, and the whole interior of car stained with blood. He turned back to Killa Saifullah and informed police and district authorities. It was learnt later that Shams-ud-din's friend had visited him at Quetta and stayed with him for three days before insisting on accompanying him to Zhob.Aftermath The next day, people took to the streets in Quetta, chanting slogans against his assassination. At Bacha Khan crossroads, police clashed with demonstrators, opening fire on the crowd, killing six and injuring more than one hundred people; however, the unrest didn't subside. His funeral prayer became a massive demonstration of popular acclaim.The next day, 14 March 1974, he was laid to rest at Zhob graveyard. At 29 years old, Shams-ud-din was survived by his widow and a daughter, his parents, and his brothers.Legacy Shams-ud-din's death created such a wave of sympathy that it left political repercussions in the province. North Balochistan is the current political heartland of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam, who controlnot only large numbers of radical Madrassas, but a majority of the legislative seats at both the national and provincial level.A main crossroads in Zhob was renamed 'Maulana Shams-ud-din Shaheed Chowk' in 2012 by the people of Zhob.Numerous legends and popular songs have grown around his personality. People still believe that on his burial there was a shower of petals, and his blood continued to ooze from his body 24 hours after his body, with a fragrant smell.References1944 births 1974 deaths Deobandis Pakistani Sunni Muslim scholars of Islam Pashtun people People from Zhob District", "machine_text": " Shams-ud-din Harifal (c. 954 - 1037) was an eminent Sufi mystic and a figurehead of the Suhrawardiyya Sufi order. He was born in Harifal, a town in the Hindu Kush mountain range in what is now Afghanistan, and is considered by many as the founder of the Suhrawardiyya order. He was embraced by his master, Sufi leader Abu Nasr as-Sarraj, at a young age and quickly gained fame for his deep devotion, relentless pursuit of truth and knowledge and for his spiritual insights and stature. He was a legendary mentor who inspired many disciples during the 11th century, the most renowned being Jami and the Ghazal poet, Sa'di Shirazi. Sufism is often defined as the mysticism of Islam, and Shams-ud-din was one of its central figures. He stressed the importance of understanding the innermost essences of being and sought to perfect the soul and its relationship to the divine. It's said that he practiced a unique form of Islamic mysticism, combining elements of both the orthodox path and the secretive teachings of Tasawwuf with basic Sufi principles. He served as an ambassador between the Ghaznavid rulers and the people of India, and was heavily involved in diplomatic negotiations, travelling widely amongst the courts of northern India and throughout the region. His diplomatic visits ultimately allowed him to pursue his spiritual studies as he not only interacted with rulers but with philosophers, artisans, merchants and many other people. He is most remembered for his teachings on the spiritual path, his monumental works on Islamic thought, spirituality, and Sufism which he wrote over the course of his lifetime, and for the powerful influence he had among many of the great Sufis and religious scholars of the 11th century. Shams-ud-din Harifal's work had a profound impact on Islamic spirituality for many centuries and is still widely respected to this day. He is remembered fondly in the Suhrawardiyya order and remains a source of inspiration for many around the world. He sought to revolutionize the realms of spirituality, morality, and ethics and his legacy lives on in his profound writings and teachings that are often studied as a part of Sufism today.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 35206470}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Old Wave\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Old Wave is the ninth studio album by English rock musician Ringo Starr. It was originally released in June 1983, on the label Bellaphon, and is the two-year follow-up to his 1981 album Stop and Smell the Roses. The title is a play on new wave music.Background and recordingAfter John Lennon's murder in December 1980, Starr returned home to England to live at Tittenhurst Park, which Starr had purchased from Lennon in 1973. In early 1982, Starr was eager to move on to his next solo project. Deciding that he needed more consistency this time around, he would work with only one producer, Joe Walsh, a former member of the recently disbanded Eagles. Walsh and Starr had known each other since the mid-1970s, having met and befriended each other in Los Angeles. Walsh immediately agreed to work with Starr and they met at Tittenhurst in February to begin writing material. Recording began shortly afterwards and instrumental backing tracks for seven songs were recorded at Startling Studios, after Starr had previously converted Lennon's recording studio. Engineering duties were handled by Jim Nipor. These sessions were mainly done with a team consisting of Starr on drums and percussion, Walsh on guitar and backing vocals, Mo Foster on bass and both Gary Brooker and Chris Stainton on keyboards.Sessions came to a halt when Walsh and Nipor went to California on 19 March. Sessions recommenced on 6 April for a few days until 16 April. On 15 April, Rolling Stone broke the news that Starr was 'in London working on a new album with Joe Walsh acting as the producer.' Lead vocals were laid down from 19 to 23 April. Sometime in May, Starr requested permission from the Windsor and Maidenhead District Council to build a new building on his Tittenhurst Park land, which he would use for video and recording purposes. Sessions resumed from 31 May until 10 June; the next day, taking the masters recorded up to that point with him, Starr and his wife Barbara Bach flew from London to Los Angeles, and returned on 14 June. The album was finished with a third batch of sessions from 24 June into early July.'Everybody's in a Hurry But Me' came about from a jam session between the Who bassist John Entwistle, drummer and percussionist Ray Cooper and Eric Clapton. 'As Far as We Can Go' was originally recorded at Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 23 July 1978. From that original rendition, only the vocal was used. Walsh re-recorded an entirely new track utilizing one of the latest technology synthesizers.Release and aftermathThe album was originally titled It Beats Sleep. The portrait on the album cover was shot in a booth in northern England, taken before Starr had joined the Beatles. As Starr's RCA contract had been cancelled, he needed to find a new label for Old Wave. Although it was just over a decade after the Beatles' dissolution, no major UK or US record company was interested in signing him. Starr would not accept that and was determined to have Old Wave released any way he could. The album was due to be released on the Boardwalk label, but never appeared, due to the death of the label's head, Neil Bogart. RCA Canada ended up distributing the album in June 1983 in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, the Netherlands, Mexico, and Brazil; while in Germany, the album and lone single pulled from it, both released on 16 June, appeared on the Bellaphon label. The Canadian release of the album occurred on 24 June. However, Old Wave failed to achieve success in any of these territories, and would be Starr's last studio album until 1992's Time Takes Time. Two singles were pulled from the album: one in Germany, 'In My Car', backed with 'As Far as We Can Go', and the other in Mexico ('I Keep Forgettin'' b/w 'She's About a Mover').Walsh's 1987 album Got Any Gum? included a cover of 'In My Car', which was released as a single and became a moderate hit. Four tracks from the album appeared on Starr's US compilation Starr Struck: Best of Ringo Starr, Vol. 2 in 1989. The album was reissued on CD in the US by The Right Stuff on 22 August 1994, the same day as Stop and Smell the Roses (1981). A further release, on 6 September, as both CD and cassette deluxe editions, included a bonus track, the original 1978 version of 'As Far as We Can Go'. On 1 November 1994, Right Stuff re-released 'In My Car', this time on yellow vinyl, with 'She's About a Mover' as the B-side.

Many up-and-coming acts were attempting to recapture the sound of the old wave in a modern context. It is not to be confused with classic rock, which refers to a particular period in Rock and Roll which started in roughly the mid 60s and ended in roughly the early 80s. The revival of old wave genres started around 2005 when acts such as Steel Panther, Jet, Taking Back Sunday, The Darkness, and Franz Ferdinand began to gain popularity. These acts all had a tendency to take the classic, classic rock sound and lyrics and put them into a modern context by altering their instrumentation and production to fit the times. The new wave brought in a new audience who, after being saturated with processional pop music from the mid 90s onwards, sought to recover the musical 'edge' that rock and metal had once possessed. Old wave has come to encompass a number of genres, including classic rock, hard rock, blues-rock, and metalcore. It can be heard in the sound of greats such as AC/DC or Led Zeppelin, but also in the sound of more modern bands like Halestorm or Disturbed. Generally, it is characterized as having an intense, rock-inspired sound, with particular attention being paid to guitar tones, song structures, and vocal delivery. Old wave has had a resurgence in the last decade, and its influence can be seen in the styles of younger bands such as The Pretty Reckless, Halestorm, and Ghost. Due to its blend of classic rock and metal influences, the genre appealed to a wider audience who were looking for something familiar, yet modern. Additionally, many of the acts that were developing in the scene have since gone on to great success, making old wave a viable style in popular music. Though old wave has made a big comeback in recent years, it is still considered to be on the fringe of mainstream music, and for the most part stays confined to specialty radio programs and independent media outlets. Its deep grooves, its blues-based guitar riffs, and its classic metal sound continue to inspire young bands, and will likely be heard for many years to come.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2540156}

The film explores the history of the income tax in the United States and the causes of its many complexities.Synopsis An Inconvenient Tax examines the Federal Income Tax and how Congress uses the complex tax code to achieve political goals that are unrelated to raising revenue. The result of 95 years of additions, subtractions, deductions, and exclusions, the 62,000 page tax code is so complex that many are voicing their desire to greatly simplify it or to even completely remove it. Currently, tax revenue cannot even pay for government spending. The film follows the progression of taxation through wars, economic booms, and significant presidencies in U.S. history. An Inconvenient Tax includes commentary from some of the nation's best-known economic experts, commentators, and political voices. Noam Chomsky, Ron Paul, Steve Forbes, Joseph Thorndike, Mike Huckabee, Charles Rossotti, David Walker, Neal Boortz, Herman Cain, Michael Graetz, Daniel Shaviro, Leonard Burman, and others discuss perceived problems in the American tax code, and also suggest possible changes. The possible solutions discussed include the FairTax, flat tax, and value added tax (VAT).An Inconvenient Tax was officially released on Tax Day – April 15, 2010.Press On April 11, 2011, Life Is My Movie Entertainment announced that An Inconvenient Tax had been acquired by Gravitas Ventures and would be distributed through cable, satellite, telco, and online Video-on-Demand (VOD) in June of that year.

An Inconvenient Tax is the concept of increasing taxes on people with higher incomes, such as those earning more than 250,000 or500,000 annually. This increase would offset some or all of the cost of providing health insurance and national safety net programs. The idea of An Inconvenient Tax is to create a tax structure better configured to support necessary social and economic policies, including health care, education, and job training. It would also put more of the tax burden on wealthier households, despite their smaller amounts of taxable income, in order to increase revenues and reduce income inequality. Supporters argue that An Inconvenient Tax would be more effective at increasing revenue, reducing inequality, and increasing funding for key social services than traditional tax reform policies. Moreover, they contend that the new tax structure would be more equitable and would help alleviate poverty and its associated problems. Additionally, they suggest the tax structure would make it easier to finance public investment such as infrastructure projects that could potentially boost the economy. Critics worry that implementing the An Inconvenient Tax would cause wealthy households to reduce their spending, resulting in decreased investment and fewer job opportunities. Additionally, it may be difficult to track how much money wealthy households actually owe to the federal government. Despite concerns over implementation and impact, the idea of An Inconvenient Tax continues to gain attention from policy makers and economists. They argue that it could be an effective means of helping fund social services, reducing income inequality, and providing more market assurance to middle and lower income households. The policy though will require careful implementation if it is to be successful.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 21065038}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Arachniotus ruber\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Arachniotus ruber is a species of fungus belonging to the genus Arachniotus in the family Gymnoascaceae. This fungus is a mesophile that reproduces both sexually and asexually. So far, there have been no reports of the fungus being pathogenic.History and taxonomy Arachniotus ruber was first described by Philippe Édouard Léon Van Tieghem in 1877 and it was thought to belong to the genus, Gymnoascus, due to similarities he observed in the gametangial initials. It was not until 1893 that Schroeter transferred the species to his recently established genus, Arachniotus, due to it possessing many of the corresponding traits. At the time, Schroeter did not designate a type species for the genus, which resulted in some debate until a lectotype, A. candidus, was eventually identified by Clements and Shear in 1931. With this change, A. ruber was excluded from the Arachniotus genus because it did not display type characteristics within its ascospores (3). Consequently, Orr, Ghosh, and Roy moved the species to the genus, Pseudoarachniotus, in 1977.Morphology Arachniotus ruber have discrete ascomata present, usually confluent and mostly spherical, measuring 20-200 μm and are red, orange, and brown in colour. Asci of A. ruber are ovoid, hyaline, and measure 10-13 x 7-10 μm. The ascospores of A. ruber are smooth, spherical, and vary in colour between red, orange, and yellow. They have an equatorial groove along the longitudinal axis, giving them a shape similar to that of a pulley wheel, and they measure 2.8-4.4 x 4-6.6 μm. Asexual spore states of A. ruber are represented by hyaline arthroaleuriospores measuring 8-30 x 2.2–3.3 μm.Habitat and ecology Arachniotus ruber has been found in the excrement of various animals, with the majority of samples being obtained in the United Kingdom and Germany. Van Tiegham first observed the species within dog and rat dung in France. Schroeter obtained samples of the species from dog and goat dung in Germany. There is also an occurrence of the species being found in hawk pellets by Dr. Arvids E. Apinis at the University of Nottingham in 1958. Another instance of A. ruber was found in a cave in Spain.Preparation and cultivation In order to sporulate under laboratory conditions, Arachniotus ruber is most commonly grown on freezing agar, which is a medium prepared using potatoes, agar, glucose, yeast extract, and activated carbon. As A. ruber grows on this medium, it will initially form white hyphae that will turn orange red and the colonies are pasty with occasional concentric rings of mycelium. The species has been observed to grow at 30 °C and show no further signs of growth at 37 °C.Usage and applications There have been very few studies that delve into the potential applications of Arachniotus ruber. One study done in 2016 displayed the potential of A. ruber being used to increase the nutritional value of wheat straw. Another, more recent study from 2019 investigated the species’ usefulness in combatting malnutrition in developing countries. The study goes into detail about how malnutrition stems from protein deficiency, and performed an experiment using A. ruber. The experiment used dry banana peels as a basis for the substrate and prepared A. ruber in media, autoclaving the two together under various conditions. After some processing, the resulting feed was consumed by broiler chicks. The results of a proximate analysis showed that A. ruber was able to increase the nutritional value of the resulting biomass protein, showing potential in this area of research.ReferencesOnygenales", "machine_text": " Arachniotus ruber is a species of predatory mygalomorph spiders in the family Theraphosidae. It is found in Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Ecuador and Galapagos Islands in western South America. The species was first described by M.E. Gertsch and A.M. Chu in 1993. Arachniotus ruber has a black to reddish-brown carapace and a yellow or orange abdomen with black markings. The body length of the adult spiders is about 5.4-7.4mm, and the leg span (distance between the tip of the longest leg pair and the tip of the shortest leg pair) is about 3.1-3.7cm. Females are usually larger than males. The spider inhabits rainforest environments, often on vegetation from the undergrowth. The species is known to build burrows near trees and shrubs and prefers to live in a dry and cool environment. The burrowing behavior is often linked to the mating behavior, as males have been observed entering the burrow of a female. Arachniotus ruber is carnivorous and feeds on insects, small vertebrates, and other spiders. It immobilizes its prey by spinning silk around them, and uses its fangs to inject venom. This spider species is believed to be a recluse, as it has been rarely observed, though they are not considered dangerous to humans. The species has been used in scientific studies in the field of phylogenetics, as the extensively studied genome of Arachiotus ruber has provided important insights into the classification of other spiders. Additionally, researchers have studies the venom of Arachniotus ruber in an effort to learn more about its biology and behavior in relation to its environment. References: Gertsch, M.E., Chu, A.M.

The ASAAC provides guidelines and standards for the avionics industry, but does not act as a regulatory body. However, ASAAC does have a system of self-governance that all members of the organization are expected to follow, including adherence to ethical and professional conduct guidelines. However, each member company is ultimately responsible for ensuring that products and services that adhere to ASAAC standards meet applicable regulatory requirements. ASAAC’s membership is made up of over 100 companies from the aerospace, aviation, and defence communities. These members include major aircraft producers such as Boeing, Airbus, and Gulfstream. In addition, various suppliers such as Rockwell Collins, Thales and Garmin, as well as universities and research institutions, are also represent. Several standards and best practices documents developed by ASAAC are available to the public at large. Each year, ASAAC holds a World Standards-Making Forum in various locations around the world. The purpose of the forum is to provide industry members with the opportunity to share their knowledge, network with suppliers and customers, and stay updated on the latest standards and requirements in the aviation industry. ASAAC plays a significant role in the continuing efforts to maintain a safe and efficient global aviation system. By setting standards for avionics architectures, ASAAC not only ensures safety and reliability, but also helps to promote cost savings and improved efficiency across the entire aviation industry.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 18594127}

Growing up, Mina was surrounded by strong Inuit women in her family, who shared stories and taught her traditional art styles. This greatly impacted her drive to create art that spoke to her identity as an Inuk. Mina attended the Concordia Inuit Curatorial Program, which allowed her to create artwork that was informed by her personal experiences of colonialism and intersects with Inuit identity. Mina's artwork often examines both global and localized stories of identity, colonialism, and healing. Her media of choice are sculpting, drawing, and sewing. She has used these techniques to create artworks such as Atlas, a life-sized sculpture of a person strapped with maps, which tackles the colonial experience of being dispossessed of one’s land. Another artwork, My Silhouette, features a series of self-portraits that combine traditional Inuit images with Western portraits, highlighting Inuk women’s experiences of self-sovereignty.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"SIG P210\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The SIG P210 (Swiss Army designation Pistole 49, the civilian model was known as SP47/8 prior to 1957) is a locked breech self loading, semi-automatic pistol designed and manufactured in Neuhausen am Rheinfall (Canton of Schaffhausen, Switzerland) by SIG from 1948 to 2006.It is of all-steel construction chambered in 9×19mm Parabellum and 7.65×21mm Parabellum. It was used from 1949 to 1975 by the Swiss Army and police units. It was also adopted and is still in service with the Military of Denmark (as M/49 Neuhausen or simply Neuhausen), in 1951 by the German Bundespolizei and in shooting sports.The pistols were decommissioned by the Swiss Army and replaced by the SIG Sauer P220 (Swiss Army designation Pistole 75) developed in 1975. Swiss production of the P210 continued until 2006. A new model, the P210 Legend, was introduced by SIG Sauer GMBH of Germany in 2010, and another, the P210A, was introduced by SIG Sauer Inc. of New Hampshire in the United States in 2017.History The design was derived from Charles Petter's Modèle 1935A pistol. In 1937, Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft (SIG) acquired a license for the Petter-Browning system from SACM in order to develop a replacement for the Luger Parabellum 06/29, which had been in service since 1900. Apparently not satisfied with the Petter Browning design or the changes they had made to it, SIG evaluated no fewer than 11 prototypes from 1942 through 1944. Selbstladepistole Neuhausen model 44/16 pistol production began in 1944. Some of the original Petter Browning features had been retained, specifically the self-contained firing and recoil systems.The Neuhausen 44/16 had a magazine capacity of 16 rounds.Development was slowed by the Second World War. After testing various experimental models (such as the aforementioned 44/16 with a double-column magazine), the 47/8 model was adopted in Oct 1948 as the Pistole Modell 1949 (P49), and SP47/8 for civilian market. Some previous series were tested by Swedish sport shooters and by the Danish army (Danish Defence designation Pistol M/1949).The 47/8 model supported the easy change of the barrels between 7.65 and 9mm Parabellum and a kit to convert to .22 caliber (see table below).SIG M/1949 is the 47/8 model purchased for the Danish military and issued version for officers, military police, and special forces, chambered in 9mm Luger.Usually called only Neuhausen in Denmark, this model is stamped 'P m/49', and also known as 'P210-DK'. First issued beginning in 1950 to the Danish Army Technical Corps (stamped 'HTK'), this remained the standard sidearm in the Danish military throughout 60 years of continuous use, since the 2010s being replaced with the SIG Sauer P320 X-5 Carry.In 1957, the civil designation (SP47/8) was definitively changed to P210 according to the company nomenclature policy. Model P210-1 in retrospect covers all models produced until 1965, the designation P210-2 refers to the standard model as produced from 1966 (beginning with serial nr. P 59071).P210-3 was a police version produced from 1951 to 1964 (serial nrs. P 6791 to P 6840 and P 8001 to P 8893), produced in limited numbers for the cantonal police forces of Basel, Lausanne, and Glarus, with a handful sold on the private market. P210-4 was the model made for the German border guard (serial nrs. D 1 to D 6500). P210-5 and P210-6 were civilian target shooting models made in the 1980s and 1990s. P210-7 was a rarely produced .22lr rimfire model, made in the 1950s and 1960s.SIG was renamed to SIG Sauer upon acquisition by SauerSohn in the 1970s, and to Swiss Arms in 2000.Swiss Arms continued production of the P210 for private customers until 2006.From 2010, a new model, dubbed P210 Legend was made by SIG Sauer, GMBH of Eckernförde, Germany. This model was exported to the USA until 2017, whenSIG Sauer Inc. of New Hampshirebegan production of its own model, dubbed P210A, made in Exeter, N.H., offered in two versions, Standard (210A-9-B) and Target (210A-9-TGT).Serial numbers Serial numbers startingA are the Swiss army ordnance models.Army models run from serial number A 100001 to A 213110. Those that have a P added to the rear of a serial number that starts with an A have been sold by the Swiss army to civilians.A stamped 'P' (='privat') on the front of the trigger guard shows that a weapon was left as a gift to the owner upon leaving the Armed Services.Serial numbers 6001 to 6028 are prototypes made during 1938–1947. 6033 to 6406 are early model SP47/8 made in 1947.Serial numbers with a P were made for police and for private use, running fromP 8001 to P 8250 (1951) andP 50004 (1949) to P 79150 (1975).Serial numbers from P 79600 to P 97950are private models made by SIG Sauer, Switzerland, during 1976–1984, and P 300001 to P 331536 were made by Sig Sauer (Swiss Arms) during 1983–2006; the jump to the 300000s range marks the transition from traditional forged frames to CNC production.During 1966–1969, SIG produced a small number of special heavy frame P210-5 models for the National Match team. These are extremely rare, with a total of 46 pieces known in literature. In the 1970s, these heavy frame models were commercialized and offered on the market, with100 pieces of P210-6 heavy frame pistols (P 76521 to P76620) made in 1979,and 50 pieces ofP210-6 heavy frame pistols, made for HofmannReinhart of Zürich (P 79101 to 79150). These pistols represent the pinnacle of SIG pistol manufacture and are extremely sought after by collectors, and consequently almost never offered on the open market.Another special edition is numbered JP 1 to JP 500 (1978, '125 Years of SIG' anniversary edition). P 555001 to P 555555 are special collectors' edition of 555 sets of five chromed pistols with gilded controls, P210, P220, P225, P226 and P230, made for Vonbank AG in 1987 to 1990), at the time sold for CHF 12,950. In 1991, another special edition numbered № 0001 to № 1991 was made to commemorate '700 Years of Swiss Confederation' (700 Jahre Eidgenossenschaft), at the time sold for CHF 4,100 per piece.Serial numbers starting with a D belong to the Bundesgrenzschutz issues(D 1 to D 6500). The Danish m/49 pistols have their own serial numbers, without a leading letter, engraved on the right side of the slide, running from 7695 (1951) to 35383 (1962).

The SIG P210 was first developed during the late 1940s and was initially issued to the military, police, and shooting organizations in Switzerland. It is widely regarded as one of the most precise and reliable handguns ever made. It has gained a reputation for its accuracy, durability, and its tightly fitted parts. The design of the SIG P210 is based on a previous pistol model developed in 1929 by an Austrian firearms designer named Charles Petter. This earlier handgun design was used in several successful European competitions of the time and would eventually serve as the basis for the SIG P210. The P210 was manufactured in Switzerland by SIG from 1949 until 2003. The SIG P210 is a single-action, double-action, semi-automatic pistol. It is chambered for the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge and is fed from an 8-round single stack magazine. It is generally considered a target pistol and is capable of firing in either single- or double-action. A manual safety is located on the left side of the pistol, above the grip. The pistol also features a loaded chamber indicator on the right side of the slide. The SIG P210 is constructed out of high-quality steel and features a solid, machined frame as well as a hammer-forged barrel. The pistol features an external slide stop and a magazine release, located near the trigger guard, which allows for fast and easy reloads. The overall design, construction, and features of the SIG P210 make it a highly accurate and reliable handgun. The SIG P210 was one of the first handguns approved for use by the Swiss military and police, and is still popular with competitive pistol shooters, both in Europe and in the United States. The reputation of the SIG P210 is such that it has been called “the Rolls Royce of handguns”. It is highly sought after as a collectible, and prices for vintage models have been known to exceed 1,000. The SIG P210 is a classic handgun design that is still highly respected and appreciated today. Its combination of quality construction, superior accuracy and reliability, and classic styling make it a highly desirable pistol for shooters and collectors alike. It is a timeless design that will continue to be appreciated for many years to come.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 499258}

It was named for Michael Snyder, its first postmaster, who also operated a store at the corner of Harlem Road, which is also known as New York State Route 240, and Main Street, which is also known as New York State Route 5. The hamlet blossomed due to retail activity demand created along the Main Street transportation route between Buffalo and points to the east in the 19th and early 20th century.As of 2009, the hamlet had several commercial districts, including a modest business district along Main Street that includes the original town focal point at Main Street and Harlem Road, and several educational institutions.The educational institutions are both public and private and range from kindergarten through college.The Snyder community has above-average affluence and education compared to the Buffalo region.The hamlet also hosts two structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places that serve as architectural artifacts of the early residential developments in the hamlet.The traditional definition of the hamlet is the 'Snyder' postal service area, now merged into the 14226 zip code.However, using United States Census Bureau-based data, which does not necessarily align exactly with the old postal boundaries, the modern definition includes parts of the neighboring Eggertsville hamlet.HistoryIn 1804, Timothy Hopkins was the first settler in the area that would later become Snydervilleand subsequently Snyder.Hopkins married Nancy Kerr in Williamsville in the first marriage on record in Erie County.As newlyweds, they moved to a log cabin on a farm on the 4301 Main Street location of Amherst Central High School.The Schenck family moved to Amherst at the corner of Main Street and Harlem Road in 1821. Abraham Snyder arrived from Pennsylvania in 1823 and moved to a spacious frame house in the late 1830s. His son Michael rose to prominence. John Schenck, Michael Snyder's cousin, built the hamlet's first house and later built the first store in 1837, which was the year the hamlet was first established.In 1830, a stagecoach was established. It was the first regularly scheduled public means of transportation between Buffalo and Batavia, and sometimes Albany, and operated along Buffalo Road, which was later renamed Main Street. By the 1850s, the Amherst economy thrived on agriculture. Snyder also had a pottery and brick factory. Throughout the 19th Century Snyder evolved as a small scale business community catering to surrounding farmers and the stagecoach line along Main Street.In 1879, the hamlets of Amherst began receiving newspaper service from the Amherst Bee, which continues to exist as of the beginning of the 21st century as a weekly newspaper. L. F. Crout opened a hotel in 1883.In 1892, an electric trolley, which ran from Main Street and Bailey Avenue, also known as U.S. Route 62, into Williamsville, connected Amherst with the city of Buffalo's streetcar system.This made Amherst's various hamlets more accessible and desirable to the wealthier city residents who were interested in expanding their estates into the 'country'.This caused growth and development of the Main and Harlem area which served as the center of town for the new suburbs. In 1905, the Snyderville Fire burned 12 buildings in the Main Street/Harlem Road area, including blacksmith shops, barns, and other businesses critical to the Snyder economy as well as livestock and stores of grain. In the 1920s, the town of Amherst began to develop by converting farmland into subdivisions. Snyder residents began to live closer to each other in new subdivisions.GeographySnyder is located in the southern part of Amherst, which is located in Erie County.As a hamlet it has no formal boundaries, but was originally defined by the area served by its post office.The traditional boundaries of the hamlet are Getzville and Brantwood Road on the west, Sheridan Drive, also known as New York State Route 324, on the north, I-290, known as the Youngmann Expressway/I-90, known as New York State Thruway on the east, and the Cheektowaga town line along Wehrle Drive east of Harlem Road and then Winspear Avenue on the south.When defining the Snyder community market area using census data, the western boundary extends a little further to include parts of the hamlet of Eggertsville, which was built around the Main Street and Eggert Road intersection, with a western boundary from north to south of Millersport Highway, also known as New York State Route 263, Longmeadow Road, Westfield Road, Main Street, LeBrun Road, and Eggert Road.When defined this way, Snyder includes (using a Main Street and Harlem Road origin, starting with the northwest quadrant, and moving clockwise) census block groups 1–3 from census tract 94.01; census block groups 34 from census tract 94.02; census block groups 3–5 from census tract 95.02; and census block groups 1, 3–5 from census tract 95.01.The center of town at Main Street and Harlem is at an elevation of .The business district is located between Burroughs Drive to the east and Campus Drive to the west on Main Street.In this region, the Snyder Fire Department, the Eggertsville-Snyder Branch of the BuffaloErie County Public Library (4622 Main Street), the Amherst YMCA (4433 Main Street), and the Main Harlem Plaza as well as the former location of the United States Postal Service office for the 14226 zip code that includes Snyder and the neighboring hamlet of Eggertsville are located.The post office for the zip code was formerly located at Main Street and Chateau Terrace with a 25 Chateau Terrace address until May 1, 1990.Harlem road crosses through the business district and connects three of the hamlet's four commercial districts.Sheridan Harlem Plaza and adjacent commercial property are located at the north end of Harlem. Both Kensington Avenue and Wehrle Drive intersect the southern part of the Snyder portion of Harlem in a commercial region that extends into Cheektowaga.The Harlem–Kensington commercial district is historic.The fourth commercial district is located in the eastern edge of the hamlet at the intersection of Main Street and Kensington Avenue near the entrance to the Youngmann Expressway. The extended Snyder community has additional commercial areas along the highly commercial Sheridan Drive and on Millersport Highway.Transportation Snyder is bounded by I-290, and has two interchanges on the eastern edge of the hamlet with this interstate highway that are both less than afrom the Main and Harlem center of town.This provides direct access to the I-90 (The New York State Thruway) and continuing south on Harlem to the New York State Route 33 a little more than a mile from Snyder through Cheektowaga also provides access to the I-90.The community is also serviced by the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority (NFTA), which provides three different bus routes (30, 48, and 49) connecting directly to the light rail Buffalo Metro Rail along Main Street to the west.All three of these routes connect to various parts of Williamsville to the east and provide connections to Erie Community College (north campus), the Buffalo Niagara International Airport and Transit Road (New York State Route 78).The hamlet is also serviced by NFTA route 65 from downtown Buffalo along Kensington Avenue to Main Street and the service continues to northeast Erie County destinations.Historically, transportation through town has been active on Main Street.In 1836, the street became a Macadam toll road.OnApril 5, 1893, the trolley line opened for business between Main Street and Bailey Avenue and the east end of Williamsvilleto the east.It was later extended another 3 miles to Transit road.LandmarksThe hamlet has two National Register of Historic Places listings: Entranceways at Main Street at Lamarck Drive and Smallwood Drive and Entranceway at Main Street at Roycroft Boulevard.The former were built in 1926 and the latter in 1918.Both were added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 7, 2005.These stone wall entrances to residential developments are common throughout Eggertsville and Snyder along Main Street and serve to give residential developments the appearance of having entrances similar to the former grand estates that were previously common along Main Street in the area.Willard Genrich built the Lord Amherst Motor Hotel on Main Street near the I-290 interchange on Main Street to harmonize with the colonial architectural motif used by the local Main Street businesses.EconomySnyder is an affluent and well-educated community in Metropolitan Buffalo.The residential population consists mostly of large single family homes on individual lots.The 2000 United States Census average household income of 87,700 ( today) far exceeds the Buffalo regional average of 57,400 ().The Snyder population declined from 14,294 to 13,875 while the number of households increased from 5,469 to 5,574 between the 1990 United States Census and the 2000 United States Census.During the decade the number of children age 5–17 and adults age 35–54 grew significantly while the young adults age 18–34 and adults over the age of 55 declined sharply.The number of housing units grew from 5,662 to 5,739. 1990 housing was 82.5", "machine_text": " Snyder, New York is a hamlet located in the town of Cheektowaga, in Erie County, New York. The hamlet is on the eastern side of the town and is bordered by the towns of West Seneca and Lancaster. The hamlet was named after early settler James Snyder, who was a prominent figure in the early development of the town. He bought a large parcel of land and began to develop it into farmland. He later sold the land to local farmers who began to build homes, stores, schools, and also established a post office in the early 1900s. The hamlet has several small businesses, including restaurants and auto repair shops, as well as a small post office. The area is also home to a number of churches, including the Our Lady of Czestochowa and St. Andrew Lutheran churches. Snyder is located just a few minutes away from Buffalo Municipal Airport, making it easily accessible to travelers. It is also close to the village of Williamsville and the cities of Amherst and Tonawanda. Besides the businesses and churches, Snyder also has recreational opportunities. The nearby Ellicott Creek is a popular spot for fishing and canoeing in the summer months while Ellicott Creek Park offers swimming, basketball, and tennis courts. The area also has a number of golf courses and numerous hiking and biking trails. Snyder is home to a number of historical sites, including the Snyder-Trenchard House, a Victorian-style home built in the late 19th century. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972 and is now open to the public for tours. Snyder is a peaceful, small hamlet, offering its residents and visitors a beautiful landscape, plenty of recreational activities, and a unique historical setting. Its convenient location and peaceful atmosphere make it a great place to call home.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 5879036}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"100 Greatest Britons\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "100 Greatest Britons is a television series that was broadcast by the BBC in 2002. It was based on a television poll conducted to determine who the British people at that time considered the greatest Britons in history. The series included individual programmes featuring the top ten, with viewers having further opportunity to vote after each programme. It concluded with a debate and final determination of the ranking of the top ten. Although many living people were included among the top 100, all of the top ten were deceased.Poll The poll resulted in nominees including Guy Fawkes, who was executed because of his role in the plot to blow up the Parliament of England; Oliver Cromwell, who created a republican British state (the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland); Richard III, suspected of murdering his nephews; James Connolly, an Irish nationalist and socialist who was executed by the Crown due to his part in the 1916 Easter Rising; Thomas Paine, who wrote against the British crown before and during the American Revolution; and a surprisingly high ranking of 17th for actor and singer Michael Crawford (the second-highest-ranked entertainer, after John Lennon). Diana, Princess of Wales, was judged to be a greater historical figure than Isaac Newton, William Shakespeare, and Charles Darwin by BBC respondents to the survey.One of the more controversial figures to be included on the list was the occultist Aleister Crowley. His works had a direct influence on the rise in popular occultism and some forms of Neopaganism in the 20th century. In addition to the Britons, some notable non-British entrants were listed, including two Irish nationals, the philanthropic musicians Bono and Bob Geldof. The top 19 entries were people of English origin (though Sir Ernest Shackleton and Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, were both born into Anglo-Irish families in what is now the Republic of Ireland when all of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom). The highest-placed Scottish entry was Alexander Fleming in 20th place, and the highest Welsh entry was Owain Glyndŵr in 23rd place. Sixty had lived in the 20th century. The highest-ranked living person was Margaret Thatcher, placed 16th. Ringo Starr was the only member of the Beatles not on the list. Isambard Kingdom Brunel occupied the top spot in the polls for some time thanks largely to 'students from Brunel University who have been campaigning vigorously for the engineer for weeks.' However, a late surge in the final week of voting put Churchill into first place. Of the top 100, only 13 were women, and only one entry, was from the BAME community (Freddie Mercury.)Reaction of black BritonsThere were no black Britons voted on the list, prompting consternation from members of the black British community that their contribution and history in the United Kingdom were not being sufficiently recognised. A separate three-month survey was conducted among the public, resulting in the publication of 100 Great Black Britons, a list of the 100 greatest black Britons as judged by the British public. In 2004, two years after the 100 Greatest Britons list was voted on, social campaigner Patrick Vernon created a similar poll exclusively voted upon by members of the black British community, with Mary Seacole being named the greatest black Briton for her actions during the Crimean War with Russia.2012 Summer OlympicsThe opening and closing ceremonies of the 2012 Summer Olympics featured the two greatest Britons, Isambard Kingdom Brunel and Winston Churchill as main characters, played by Kenneth Branagh and Timothy Spall, each of them reading a monologue from William Shakespeare's The Tempest.

The list was compiled in 2002 by a panel of judges in conjunction with the BBC and chosen through a public vote. The results were broadcast on the BBC programme The 100 Greatest Britons. The list features a range of prominent figures from their fields of politics, science, literature, music and arts. People such as David Beckham, the Queen and Winston Churchill are listed among some of Britain's most significant figures throughout its history. In terms of numbers, the list was dominated by historical figures, with more than half of the entrants being from the 18th century and earlier. Of the modern-era figures, the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was the only female to appear in the top 10. She was placed number two on the list, just behind Winston Churchill. Charles Darwin appeared at number three, Queen Elizabeth II at number four and William Shakespeare placed fifth. George Orwell, Isaac Newton, William Wilberforce, Ernest Rutherford, and Oliver Cromwell rounded out the top ten. Other notable figures included Nelson Mandela (ranked 13th); Diana, Princess of Wales (20th); and J. K. Rowling (36th). The 100 Greatest Britons also included pioneers such as Elizabeth Fry, Christopher Wren and Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The list was inspired by the American TV series of the same name that had ran since 1999. It is considered to be an open-ended project, which means it can be added to and amended over time. Indeed, the BBC has regularly updated the list in order to add new entrants and reflect changing opinions. The 100 Greatest Britons list has been celebrated both as a celebration of historical and modern figures who have defined British identity but also as a reflection of the country’s diversity and accomplishments. As the BBC stated in 2002, 'The list of one hundred people chosen represents not only a significant achievement but also a celebration of humanity's capacity for greatness'.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 200958}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Proto-Afroasiatic language\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Proto–Afroasiatic, sometimes referred to as Proto-Afrasian, is the reconstructed proto-language from which all modern Afroasiatic languages are descended. Though estimations vary widely, it is believed by scholars to have been spoken as a single language around 12,000 to 18,000 years ago (12 to 18 kya), that is, between 16,000 and 10,000 BC. The reconstruction of Proto-Afroasiatic is problematic and remains largely lacking. Moreover, no consensus exists as to the location of the Afroasiatic Urheimat, the putative homeland of Proto-Afroasiatic speakers.UrheimatA commonly proposed homeland is northeast Africa, particularly in or near Ethiopia, in part due to the presence of many branches of the family in and near that region (and in Africa). According to others, words for fauna and flora and evidence of linguistic contact with language families known to have been spoken in Eurasia suggest that its home was in the Middle East, probably the Levant. Some geneticists and archaeologists have argued for a back migration of proto-Afroasiatic speakers from Western Asia to Africa as early as the 10th millennium BC. It has been suggested that the Natufian culture might have spoken a proto-Afroasian language just prior to its disintegration into sub-languages. The hypothesis is supported by the Afroasiatic terms for early livestock and crops in Anatolia and Iran, but would then imply that branches other than Semitic developed outside of the proposed homeland. According to linguist Václav Blažek, the possibility a language similar to Cushitic being formerly spoken originally in the south of Arabia also speaks for a Middle Eastern origin. But some other proposals posit Northern Africa or the Horn of Africa as possible places of origin.Consonant correspondences The following table shows consonant correspondences in Afroasiatic languages, as given in Dolgopolsky (1999), along with some reconstructed consonants for Proto-Afroasiatic.under special conditionsNOTE:=Symbols with dots underneath are emphatic consonants (variously glottalized, ejective or pharyngealized). Transcription of Ancient Egyptian follows Allen (2000); see Transliteration of Ancient Egyptian.The following are possible values for the non-IPA symbols used for Ancient Egyptian:= ;= ;= , or ejective .Pronounsreconstructs the following pronouns, most of which are supported by at least five of the six branches:Numeralsreconstructs the following cardinal numbers (Ehret does not include Berber in his reconstruction):The first root for 'two' has been compared to Berber (Tamazight) . There are other proposed cognate sets:'six': Egyptian , Proto-Semitic , Berber (Tamazight) . 'seven': Egyptian , Proto-Semitic , Berber (Tamazight) .Grammar It has been proposed that Proto-Afroasiatic had marked nominative case marking, where the subject was overtly marked for nominative case, while the object appeared in unmarked default case. Marked nominative case marking is still found in languages of the Cushitic, Omotic and Berber branches. Its syntax possibly featured an exclusively default, strict word ordering of VSO. Although some Afroasiatic languages have developed free word order, it is generally surmised that PAA was originally a VO language.See alsoAfroasiatic phonetic notation Nostratic languages Proto-Afroasiatic reconstructions (Wiktionary)ReferencesBibliographyAfro-Asiatic Afroasiatic languages", "machine_text": " Proto-Afroasiatic (also known as Proto-Afro-Asiatic, Proto-Afrasian, Proto-Afrasiac or Proto-Afroasiatic-Afrasian) is the reconstructed proto-language that is ancestral to the various Afroasiatic language groups. It is believed to have been spoken in northern Africa, the Horn of Africa, the Sahara, and across the Levant, with the possible addition of areas in Sudan and Sahel later. The proto-language is generally believed to have been spoken between the 6th and 4th millennia BCE with a long and complex period of divergence beginning in the 5th millennium BCE, but it is also possible that it could have been spoken earlier than this. The proto-language has been reconstructed using the method of internal reconstruction, which involves comparing historical languages to each other and drawing tentative conclusions about the way they are related. There is still much debate concerning the exact nature of the proto-language and which languages are descended from it. There is general agreement that the language family comprises a number of languages and language branches including Berber, Chadic, Cushitic, Amharic, and Osmanic, among others. It is thought that these languages share some common ancestor language, which had a distinct syntax, morphology, and phoneme inventory. In addition to being the source for today's Afroasiatic languages, Proto-Afroasiatic is also considered to be the ancestral language of many modern African languages, such as Yoruba and Somali. Even with the interaction between many cultures over the centuries, the language was still able to remain relatively unchanged from its initial development. The reconstructed phoneme inventory of Proto-Afroasiatic includes a small set of consonants, about twenty consonants including ejectives, implosives, and fricatives, as well as a simple vowel system. This inventory is comparable to the features found in the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European but has a distinctively Afrasian character. The small number of Proto-Afroasiatic words that have been reconstructed suggest an extremely simple grammar that was especially unburdened by noun-case inflections. The language also lacked the use of adjectives or adverbs, and pronouns were limited to the demonstrative and relative. These suggestive pieces of evidence could indicate that the language was a relatively simple one that didn't require complicated grammatical rules for its use. The lack of data and the complexity of the reconstructing process make it difficult to ascertain many of the features of Proto-Afroasiatic but it is still possible to make educated guesses based on the available evidence. Although much has yet to be determined, it is clear that Proto-Afroasiatic is an important language family that formed a substantial foundation for many of today’s African languages.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 3415272}

Lamar in August 1838 from George Wheelwright urged reconsideration of Fisher for Secretary for the good of the navy and defense of the Republic and Houston suspended Fisher from office in October 1837, to secure 'harmony and efficiency'.Many in the senate opposed the move and the Senate ordered Fisher's reinstatement on October 18, 1837. This event was a major incident in the early days of the Republic of Texas and added to the severe split between the various factions in the government.Sam Houston Dixon in 'The Men Who Made Texas Free' wrote that 'when Mr. Fisher died, Richard Ellis, who was president of the convention which declared Texas independent of Mexico, said from the floor of the Senate:'In the death of Rhodes Fisher the Republic has lost one of its wisest defenders. He was a man of poise even midst times of stress and excitement. Well do some of us remember his cool and deliberate consideration of our acts at Old Washington, March, 1836; how his voice of caution rang out as men of zeal vied with one another in their precipitous rush to complete their labors of establishing a government and returning to their homes. So earnestly did he plead and so logical was his appeal that we were persuaded to follow his advice........There was nothing of the braggadocio about him and he did not lack courage to express his opinions.''Fisher died on March 14, 1839, and was buried at Matagorda.

It contains a single species, T. peyeri. T. peyeri specimens are most common in the Besano Formation (or Grenzbitumenzone) of Monte San Giorgio in Ticino. Other coelacanths from Monte San Giorgio include a larger species (tentatively referred to Holophagus picenus) from the Besano Formation, and a species of Heptanema from the Meride Limestone. Larger Ticinepomis specimens have been found in the Prosanto Formation of Graubünden.Ticinepomis was originally described as being a member of the family Coelacanthidae, being similar to Coelacanthus, Holophagus and Undina. Later, T. peyeri was placed in Latimeriidae. The bizarre Prosanto Formation latimeriid Foreyia is thought to be T. peyeris closest relative, as they share many features despite their drastically contrasting appearances.ReferencesLatimeriidae Prehistoric lobe-finned fish genera Triassic bony fish Triassic fish of Europe Fossil taxa described in 1980", "machine_text": " Ticinepomis is an extinct genus of trilobites that lived during the Ordovician period, from 470 to 460 million years ago. It is a member of the family Odontopleuridae. The genus’ fossilized remains have been found in North America. Ticinepomis is characterized by its slender and elongated body. It has a subquadrate glabella, eight axial rings, and three free cheeks separated by a notch. Its cephalic region is short, making the pygidium wider in comparison, and the latter has a broad and rounded margin. Its tail spine is long and slender, ending in a curved or upturned tip. Only two species are known to belong to the genus. Those are Ticinepomis platycephalus and Ticinepomis allisoni. T. platycephalus had a larger size than T. allisoni and is characterized by its broader glabellae and short free cheeks. T. allisoni had a more slender shape and more asymmetrical glabellae. The diet of Ticinepomis is believed to have included small invertebrates. Although small, these trilobites had an armor-like shell that protected them from predators, since large predators of the time did not have the capacity to pierce through it. The overall distribution of Ticinepomis is still unknown, as fossils have only been found in North America, specifically in Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, and Oklahoma. However, since other species of the same family have been found in Europe, it is likely that Ticinepomis may have been able to colonize other areas in the past.

It is a tributary of the Vienne River, which it joins at Saint-Junien. The Ventadour River originates in the foothills of the Massif Central, near Pierre-Buffière and Saint-Yrieix. It runs for a length of approximately 34 km (21 miles). The Ventadour River tends to keep a steady flow and is not very wide, with a mean width of 1,5 to 2 meters (5 to 6.5 ft.). The main tributary of the Ventadour River is the Claise River. It is joined at Pierrefitte-Nestalot by the Creuse River, a smaller tributary. The area around the Ventadour River is mostly agricultural land, with small villages dotting the landscape. The river's course is subject to occasional flooding. This can be particularly evident near the lower reaches of the Ventadour, where it meets the Vienne River. The river is home to a variety of fish, including pike and European perch, making it a popular spot for anglers and recreational fishing. The banks of the Ventadour are also prime locations for bird-watchers, with wild geese, ducks, and other waterfowl often seen in and around the river. The Ventadour and its banks have been used for centuries as a means of transport and communication, first by navigable vessels and later through roadways. It is now an important economic resource, providing a number of jobs in countless industries, including fishing, logging, and tourism. The environment of the Ventadour River is protected by several laws and regulations enacted by the French government. The river is considered to be an important part of France's natural heritage and is safe from pollution and development. In recent years, the Ventadour River has become a popular tourist destination, with visitors drawn to its riverside communities, as well as its abundant flora and fauna. Along its course, the Ventadour passes through several picturesque towns and regions, making it a popular venue for boating and other outdoor activities.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Nel Erasmus\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Nel Erasmus (born 1928 in Bethal, Transvaal Province, South Africa) is a South African artist.Erasmus once stated, “I am happiest when heart and head seem to walk a tightrope on the canvas – where feeling and thought seem to be in tension. For me these two sometimes manage to contain me and my shadow, my heart and my head…”.Erasmus studied at the Académie Ranson, Ecole des Beaux Arts and the Sorbonne in Paris in 1953 and exhibited her works for the first time in Paris in 1955. Her first solo exhibition was in South Africa in 1957 and she is one of the earliest abstract artists of South Africa. Erasmus has produced thirty solo exhibitions, taken part in more than seventy group exhibitions and her writing has been widely published. Although Erasmus was never a ‘popular’ painter, her work received much critical acclaim and she was the only South African artist to be included in Michel Seuphor’s 1964 survey of abstraction, Abstract Painting: 50 Years of Accomplishment.Three other South Africans who spent time with Erasmus in Paris in the early 1950s and who appeared to have been inspired by the intuitive processes of post-war abstract painting in Paris were Christo Coetzee, Paul du Toit, and Eric Loubser.Abstract Art in AfricaNel Erasmus was an early proponent of Abstract Art in South Africa – both as a practice and a principle. Erasmus also influenced the South African art scene as director of the Johannesburg Art Gallery (JAG) (1966–1977).The New Church Museum curator Marilyn Martin, who curated the Museum's Thinking, Feeling, Head, Heart exhibition, describes Erasmus' abstract content through two of her works, Space Dance II and Whirlwind, which are both characterised by brightly coloured forms in flux.Martin says, “The time bound object dissolves and reshapes itself into symbols, images and signs, which it actually and secretly contains within itself. These signs can point more directly towards the essence of a thing, its energy; its relatedness to things other than itself.'Education and influencers1950 University of the Witwatersrand, BA Fine Arts (under Joyce Leonard and Heather Martienssen, with Christo Coetzee, Gordon Vorster, Cecil Skotnes, and Larry Scully)1952 National Arts Teacher’s Certificate, Wits Technikon1952 Private study under Gina BerndtsonHenry Focillon’s La vie des Formes - Nel Erasmus calls this book the “bible” for her work.Anton Hendriks, Director of the Johannesburg Art Gallery when Erasmus started working there, gave her an appreciation of museum discipline and intellectual honesty through his historical and philosophical interests.1953–1955 Sorbonne, Ecole des Beaux Arts and Académie Ranson, Paris (under Gustave Singier, Selim Turan, and Marcel Fiorini)Career junctionsPainting periods1960s – formalist/post-cubist abstract periodEarly 1970s – emotionally-revealing and expressiveLate 1970s – quiet colour fields fleeting energies give way to slow pushes and pulls1980s – calligraphy and objects in flux1990s – body as vessel, seed and germination2000s – portraiture, polarity of heart and mind2010s – flightCurrently – patterns of soundDirector of the Johannesburg Art Gallery (JAG) 1966–1977Nel Erasmus worked at the Johannesburg Art Gallery (JAG) from 1957 as Professional Officer until her retirement as Director in 1977. She has contributed to the acquisition of artworks to public and corporate (especially Sanlam and Sasol) collections in South Africa, in particular the international modern and contemporary collection at the Johannesburg Art Gallery (JAG).Erasmus’ notorious acquisition in 1973, the year Picasso died, of Pablo Picasso’s Tête d’Arlequin (1971) was made possible by funding from The Friends of the Museum organization. The acquisition of this painting of a clown met with resistance from conservative, censored, isolated, apartheid South Africa, “No normal person would like this painting”, and provoked Erasmus to write a paper about why the acquisition was made.Nel Erasmus writes in response to visitors to Picasso’s Tête d’Arlequin, that art is not there to please or depict, it is there to reveal. Erasmus says that because Picasso had such an impact on art in our times, museums should have an example of his work in their permanent collections. With this acquisition JAG now had an example of Picasso’s mature post-cubist work. Erasmus asks the public not to refer to the painting as that of a clown, but as a harlequin and so give him the respect he is due.Erasmus explained that it was policy of other art museums in South Africa to make collections of South African art and JAG did have a policy to focus on international art. During her tenure she also grew the South African collection extensively. By 1975 an exhibition of 40 artists was held of JAG's holdings.Current workNel Erasmus is in her 80s and still paints daily. The most recent exhibitions she has participated in were solo exhibitions in 2009 in the Dawid Ras Art Gallery (Johannesburg) and in 2015 in the Dawid Ras Gallery (Cape Town), and since then various group exhibitions.Awards and honors1991 Helgaard Steyn Award for Best South African Painting for Jazz Baby/Spent Autumn (1991)Selected exhibitions1955 Galerie Bogroff, Paris1955 10th Salon des Réalités Nouvelles in the Musée d'Art Modern, Paris1957 Henri Lidchi Art Gallery, Johannesburg (first solo exhibition)1957 Galerie Creuze and Musée d'Art Modern, Paris1965 Second Biennale de Paris, Paris and year appointed at Johannesburg Art Gallery as Professional Officer)1965 São Paulo Biennale, São Paulo1982–1991 Cassirer Fine Art Gallery, JohannesburgSelected collections and worksAnglo-AmericanIziko South African National Gallery, Cape Town – Sketch for the Great Cellist (1963), The Great Celllist (1963)Johannesburg Art Gallery, Johannesburg – Whirlpool in a Human Matrix (1974)Oliewenhuis Art Museum, Bloemfontein - Jazz Baby/Spent Autumn (1991)Pretoria Art Museum, Pretoria – Space Dance No. 5 (1984); Bold Swimmer (1986)Rand Merchant BankRembrandt Art Foundation – Lamps (1964)Sasol CollectionSanlam Art Collection – 6th Day of Creation (1995)TelkomUniversity of Stellenbosch, Stellenbosch – Hands Off (1989)University of the Witwatersrand Art Museum, JohannesburgFurther readingAbstract Painting: 50 Years of Accomplishment, from Kandinsky to the Present by Michel Seuphor.

The two ships in the class may be described as a hybrid between a frigate and military transport ship with multiple role capabilities, with the capacity to be transformed from a combat ship with the firepower of a traditional frigate to a hospital ship within a day.Design The class is based on a frigate-like design, but built with an internal multipurpose deck (flex deck) and a stern vehicle ramp. The ships can serve as command platforms for a staff of 75 persons (naval or joint staff) with a containerized command and control centre, transport and base of operations for a company-sized landing force of some 200 soldiers with vehicles. Alternatively, the flex deck can be used for mine-laying operations with a capacity of some 300 mines, or be fitted out for mine-clearing operations and launch and recover mine detecting and clearing equipment via a retractable gantry crane, adjacent to the stern vehicle ramp, which also is used for launching and recovering the fast landing craft. Furthermore, the flex deck can support a containerized hospital or simply transport a number of ISO standard containers or some 55 vehicles, including up to seven MBTs. The ships can carry two landing craft, personnel (LCPs) (Storebro SB90E), two rigid hull inflatable boats and two EH101 helicopters.The ships have been designed by a joint team from The Royal Danish Navy (RDN), the Danish Defence Acquisition and Logistics Organization (DALO) and a group of contractors, primarily Odense Maritime Technology (OMT) to the Royal Danish Navy's requirements for a multi-mission frigate-like ship with an emphasis on flexibility.The ships are built to the naval standards of Det Norske Veritas (DNV GL), an international certification body and classification society, heavily utilizing STANAG.The design is built with the aim of a large margin for growth over life-cycle, to a relatively low cost of ownership, with open architecture for ease of upgrades, with a high degree of automation allowing smaller crews, and utilizing StanFlex modules that can be shared across several ship classes in service with the Royal Danish Navy.The hulls were built in highly competitive commercial shipyards using the latest development in the industries shipbuilding technology and cost-effective production procedures and processes. The outfitting and integration of sensor, communication and weapons systems was primarily carried out 'in-house' by the RDN and DALO.The standard weapons of the Absalon class can be supplemented through the use of StanFlex mission modules. A special weapons deck (nicknamed the 'Bathtub') is designed with five StanFlex module slots. Because of the Bathtub's position, only missile-firing weapons modules can be installed.History The ships were named after two brothers, Esbern Snare and archbishop Absalon, who led the naval campaigns in the 12th century against the Wends, a group of pagan Slavs in northern Germany.Production started at Odense Steel Shipyard on 30 April 2003, with the lead ship Absalon laid down on 28 November of that year. Esbern Snare followed on 24 March 2004; they were both launched later that year. They were delivered on 19 October 2004 and 17 April 2005 respectively, and commissioned on 10 January 2005 and 17 June 2005. At this point they had the StanFlex modules installed, but would have to wait until 2007 for full operational capability, with the installation of the 35mm CIWS, Mk32 torpedo launchers and Seagnat/SRBOC decoy systems.Among other upgrades the two ships of the Absalon class were fitted with the newer Terma Scanter 6002 to replace the Scanter 2001 in 2020.For political reasons, the ships were originally launched as 'Flexible support ships' to avoid antagonising Russia after the end of the cold war. On the 16th of October 2020, both ships were reclassed as ASW-frigates. Both ships will be upgraded with towed array sonars in addition to the existing, hull-mounted sonar and the Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk helicopters will be equipped with dipping sonars, sonobuoys and torpedoes.

Mendenhall in 1971.DescriptionThe ostracon displays a series of incisions in the pottery that have been suggested to be an early type of Bronze Age writing. The text has been compared to Byblian pseudo-hieroglyphic, but also Minoan Linear A and Linear B, Anatolian, Canaanite and various other old languages. It is regarded as a rare trace of early written communication and important for further academic investigation. The pottery sherd shows a badly defined row of symbols in what some consider to be an abstract linear rather than pictographic form of character. It has not been reliably dated however suggestions have been made ofor earlier. It has a double rope moulding that is similar to other Middle Bronze Age pottery from the Euphrates valley area of Syria. Dr. Cherie J. Lenzen has also suggested similar features were noted on pottery found at Tell Irbid in northern Jordan. Despite calls for dismissal or denial of the sherd as a 'by-form' of the alphabet by Frank M. Cross, Mendenhall has said that the sherd 'clearly exhibits both the dâl and the thâ of later Eastern alphabets'. He states 'the sherd is perhaps older than any other alphabetic inscription so far discovered'.ReferencesArchaeological artifacts Inscriptions in undeciphered writing systems Ancient pottery Individual pieces of pottery", "machine_text": " McClelland sherd is a type of prehistoric Native American pottery dating from between 2200 BC and 1700 BC. It is most closely associated with cultures in the Eastern United States, particularly the areas around Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. Named after its discoverer, late 19th-century American archaeologist Warren K. Moorehead, the McClelland sherd is the earliest known pottery made by people indigenous to North America. The McClelland sherd, often referred to as the ‘McKinney Sherd’, was first discovered in a shallow archaeological excavation near the Big Miami River, east of Troy, Ohio in 1889. The sherd has an outer surface made of plain, tan-colored clay. It is a flat, round object 5 3/4 inches in diameter and 1/8 of an inch thick. There are several shallow paste decorations of vaguely geometric shapes that resemble a ‘rainbow pattern’ around the outer perimeter of the sherd. It is believed that McClelland sherds represent the earliest native peoples to inhabit the Great Lakes region during the Archaic period of American prehistory, prior to the development of agricultural societies. The shallow decoration on the sherd suggests that it was used for some decorative purpose, and its presence on the surface of the earth for thousands of years hints at the sophistication of these early hunters and gatherers in their development of pottery technology. The significance of the McClelland sherd cannot be overstated. It serves as scientific evidence of the presence of these early inhabitants of North America, and is a legitimate reminder of the incredible impact that the earliest inhabitants of North America had on the material culture of the Great Lakes region over seven thousand years ago. The McClelland sherd continues to be studied by archaeologists from around the world, and its importance to the archaeological record remains undeniable. In addition to its scientific value, it serves as a testament to the continuity of indigenous cultures in the Eastern United States and the New World. It is a valuable reminder of the inventions and craftsmanship of the indigenous North American peoples and of the deep roots of their culture.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 31347126}

He was born in Claines, near Worcester, the son of James Dyson Perrins, the owner of the LeaPerrins Worcestershire sauce factory and the grandson of William Perrins, co-originator of the LeaPerrins secret recipe.Biography He was educated at Charterhouse School and The Queen's College, Oxford, and then served in the Highland Light Infantry. After the death of his father, he took over management of LeaPerrins. His father had also been a director of Royal Worcester Porcelain Factory, and Charles followed him, becoming a director in 1891. He became chairman in 1901, and supported the factory financially. He bought the company outright in 1934 and ensured its continuity from his own fortune, until it could be taken public in 1954.In 1927, he purchased the Royal Worcester Porcelain Factory's historic ceramics collection for a price above market value, to assist the firm's cashflow. In 1946, he established the Perrins Trust to unite the factory museum collection and his own private holdings of Royal Worcester and ensure their survival. After his death, his widow established the 'Dyson Perrins Museum' at the factory site to house the collection. It is now called 'The Museum of Royal Worcester' (previously 'Worcester Porcelain Museum').Perrins lived in Malvern for most of his life and amongst his many charitable deeds in Worcestershire was the endowment of Dyson Perrins Church of England Academy in Malvern. He served as Mayor of Worcester for 1897–98 and as High Sheriff of Worcestershire for 1899–1900.He was a major benefactor of the Royal Grammar School, Worcester, and endowed new buildings including Perrins Hall (1914) named after his father, an old boy. The school organ is in this building and is played regularly at assemblies. He became a Six Master and chairman of the governors of that school until the 1950s. His portrait by A. Hacker c. 1907 hangs in the hall.In Oxford, he funded the building of the Dyson Perrins Laboratory, which was the main centre for research into organic chemistry at Oxford University from its foundation in 1916 until its retirement as a laboratory in 2003. He received an honorary DCL from Oxford University.During Perrins's life he amassed one of the most important book collections in the world, particularly strong in medieval illuminated manuscripts and printed ballads. To help finance and re-establish the Royal Worcester factory after World War II, he decided to sell his important collection of early printed books, and they were mostly dispersed in a series of sales at Sotheby's in London in 1946 and 1947. His illuminated manuscripts and other remaining printed books were sold after his death in three major auction sales in 1958 to 1960. A record total for a single collection of £1,100,000 was raised by these sales. Items once owned by C. W. Dyson Perrins now form the basis of many other prominent collections, such as the Lessing J. Rosenwald Collection now in the Library of Congress.Many other items from his collection were given or bequeathed by him to public institutions such as the Victoria and Albert Museum, the National Gallery, the Ashmolean Museum, Winchester Cathedral library, and the British Museum.

He also brought about a successful marketing campaign which saw the brand become incredibly popular. He remained chairman of the business until his death in 1958. As well as his business successes, Dyson was highly regarded for his charitable works. Most notably, in 1927 he gifted 50 acres of land to Worcester city and, with the help of the city, turned it into the stunning Perrins Park. This park was, and still is, a valuable oasis in a city centre with a large amount of commercial property. Throughout his life, Dyson Perrins donated generously to Worcester city and its institutions. He provided equipment and support to many hospitals and medical research institutions (including Saint Giles Hospital), as well as supporting local charities and voluntary organisations. His greatest legacy to the city of Worcester was the PerrinsPark. In November 2014, the Trustees of Dyson Perrins Benevolent Fund donated £150,000 to the park for its redevelopment.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Frank Staff\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Frank Staff (15 June 1918 – 10 May 1971) was a South African ballet dancer, choreographer, producer, and company director. He was a major figure in the history of European theatrical dance in South Africa.Early life Frank Cedric Staff was born to an Irish mother and an English father in the diamond mining town of Kimberley, in what is now the Northern Cape Province of South Africa. As a teenager, he moved to Cape Town, where he attended Diocesan College and received his early dance training from Helen Webb and Maude Lloyd, who had studied with Marie Rambert in London. After Lloyd returned to England in 1933, she encouraged her young pupil to join her. At age fifteen, Staff moved to London to continue his training at Rambert's school in Bedford Gardens.Career Staff was soon invited to join Rambert's Ballet Club, as her performing group was then called. For the next twelve years, from 1933 to 1945, he worked with the Rambert company as both a dancer and choreographer. Except for two seasons with the Vic-Wells Ballet, 1934/35 and 1938/39, and a brief stint with Walter Gore's London Ballet in 1940, he was a featured performer and choreographer with Ballet Rambert.Dancer Staff inherited many of Hugh Laing's roles in the Rambert repertory, including The Lover in Jardin aux Lilas and Mercury in The Planets, both works by Antony Tudor. He also danced in several ballets by Frederick Ashton, among them Recamier, Façade, and Mephisto Valse. For the Vic-Wells company, he appeared as Horn Blower in The Rake's Progress by Ninette de Valois and created the role of Cupid in Ashton's Cupid and Psyche (1939). For the London Ballet, he created the role of The Boy, Julien, in La Fête Ėtrange (1940), set to music of Gabriel Fauré by Andrée Howard. Other roles in his varied repertory included The Poet in Les Sylphides, the Spectre in Le Spectre de la Rose, and Harlequin in Le Carnaval, all choreographed by Michel Fokine. He also danced such different roles as Bluebird in The Sleeping Beauty, by Petipa; the Faun in Afternoon of a Faun, by Nijinsky; and Death in Death and the Maiden, by Howard.Choreographer Staff's first choreographic work, The Tartans, was a new version of Ashton's ballet of the same name. A pas de trois for himself, his wife Elisabeth Schooling, and Walter Gore, set to music by William Boyce, it was made for Ballet Rambert in 1938. Over the next two years, he contributed three of his best works to the company's repertory: Czernyana (1939), to the piano exercises of Carl Czerny; Enigma Variations (1939), to the score by Edward Elgar; and Peter and the Wolf (1940), to the music and text of Sergei Prokofiev. All these works displayed his facility for witty invention that would characterize many of his later ballets. He also created Czerny 2 (1941), a second version of his popular hit, a series of dances caricaturing different kinds of ballet. Combined with its predecessor under the title Czernyana, it remained in the Rambert repertory for many years. During the war years in England—September 1939 to May 1945—Staff served as a captain in the Argyle and Sutherland Highlanders but was released temporarily to choreograph Peter and the Wolf and Czerny 2.Upon completion of his military service, Staff returned to his homeland in 1946 and joined the South African National Ballet in Cape Town. There he danced in his own ballets and produced works in which he had appeared in England, notably Nijinsky's L'Après-midi d'un Faune and Howard's Death and the Maiden. Returning to Britain in 1947, Staff spent the next few years as an international freelance. He served as resident choreographer of the Metropolitan Ballet (1947–1948), toured Australia with Ballet Rambert (1948), toured the United States and Canada with Sadler's Wells Ballet (1949), and was subsequently appointed ballet master and choreographer at the Empire Theatre (1950) on London's Leicester Square. In 1953, he went back to South Africa and in 1955 founded his own company, the South African Ballet, for which he choreographed or produced more than fifteen works, including Don Juan (1955), with music by Rachmaninoff; Transfigured Night (1957), to music by Schoenberg; and The Swan of Tuonela (1958), to music by Sibelius.In 1963, the South African government established four professional ballet companies, one in each of the four provinces, and Staff would eventually work with them all: the companies of the Cape Performing Arts Board (CAPAB Ballet), the Natal Performing Arts Council (NAPAC Ballet), the Performing Arts Council of the Transvaal (PACT Ballet), and the Performing Arts Council of the Orange Free State (PACOFS Ballet). For CAPAB Ballet, based in Cape Town, he mounted Romeo and Juliet (1964), to the Prokofiev score, and for NAPAC Ballet, in Durban, he set Apollo 65 (1965), to music by Benjamin Britten. Moving on to the Transvaal in 1966, he worked in Johannesburg until 1968 as resident producer and choreographer with PACT Ballet under the direction of Faith de Villiers. These years were especially productive. Beside staging his popular Peter and the Wolf, he created seven new ballets. Among them were Spanish Encounter (1966), set to the classical guitar music of Joaquin Rodrigo; Five Faces of Euridyce (1966), set to music by Stephen O'Reilly and described as a 'good-humoured ballet in five visions'; Czernyana III, the third rescension of his first big hit; and Raka (1967), a three-act ballet set to a score by Graham Newcater and based on an epic poem in Afrikaans by N.P. van Wyk Louw. Raka proved such a success that it was soon made into a film that was distributed worldwide by Twentieth Century Fox.Thereafter, Staff was artistic director of PACOFS Ballet in Bloemfontein from 1969 until his death in 1971. Among the six ballets he created for this company were two notable works made in 1970: Mantis Moon, based on a Bushman legend and set to music by Hans Maske, and Séance, derived from Menotti's opera The Medium but set to music by Britten. Staff's unfinished work, The Rain Queen (1971), set to a commissioned score by Newcater, was planned as the first full-length ballet with an indigenous South African theme. The title character, known as the Rain Queen, was Modjadji, the hereditary queen of the Lobedu people (ba Lobedu) of the Limpopo Province. In homage to Staff, the work was rechoreographed by David Poole and mounted for CAPAB Ballet in cooperation with PACOFS.Personal life Staff married four times. He wed his fellow Ballet Rambert dancer Elisabeth Schooling in 1942, and she danced in many of his early works. He next married English dancer Jaqueline St. Clere, followed by South African musical comedy actress Heather Lloyd-Jones. All three of these marriages ended in divorce. Staff's fourth wife was South African dancer Veronica Paeper, who became a prolific choreographer in her own right as director of CAPAB Ballet, later known as Cape Town City Ballet. Each of Staff's four wives bore him a son.References1918 births 1971 deaths South African choreographers South African male ballet dancers Ballet choreographers Rambert Dance Company dancers", "machine_text": " Frank Staff (born 22 October 1917) is a British sculptor and painter who is one of the most influential and important British sculptors of the 20th century.

In 2000, 2001, and 2005, Markopolos alerted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of his views, supplying supporting documents, but each time the SEC ignored him or gave his evidence only a cursory investigation. Madoff was finally revealed to be a fraud in December 2008, when his sons contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation. After admitting to operating the largest private Ponzi scheme in history, Madoff was sentenced in 2009 to 150 years in prison.In 2010, Markopolos' book on uncovering the Madoff fraud, No One Would Listen: A True Financial Thriller, was published. Markopolos has criticized the SEC for failing to discover the Madoff fraud despite repeated tips, and for failing to investigate properly the larger companies it supervised. Critics of Markopolos have called him obsessive, a self-publicist, and self-righteous, and some questioned whether he was motivated by a financial bounty, which he denied.Education and careerMarkopolos attended Roman Catholic schools, graduating from Cathedral Preparatory School in Erie, Pennsylvania, in 1974. He received an undergraduate degree in Business Administration from Loyola College in Maryland in 1981, and a Master of Science in Finance from Boston College in 1997.

Markopolos tirelessly pursued the case for nine years, against all odds, and eventually brought Madoff to justice. Markopolos was born in Troy, Ohio in 1957. A graduate of Youngstown State University, he began his career as a financial analyst in Boston, Massachusetts. It was in this role that he first became interested in finding out more about Bernie Madoff, a financier in New York. After noticing discrepancies between Madoff's reported returns and market trends, he quickly realized that Madoff was funneling investor's money into his own pockets. Markopolos brought his suspicions to the attention of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2000. However, they did not take his warnings seriously, and it took Markopolos nine years to eventually bring Madoff to justice in 2009. During this time, Markopolos was putting his own safety at risk, as he was threatening the integrity of a powerful financial figure. In 2010, Markopolos released a book on his experience, called ‘No One Would Listen’. Since then, Markopolos' story has often been depicted in popular culture, such as the television series ‘The Good Wife’.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"1634: The Ram Rebellion\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "1634: The Ram Rebellion is the seventh published work in the 1632 alternate history book series, and is the third work to establish what is best considered as a 'main plot line or thread' of historical speculative focus that are loosely organized and classified geographically. The initial main thread is called the 'Western and North-Central Europe thread' (encompassing northern and western Germany, Denmark, England, France, the Low Countries, Sweden and the Baltic); the second plot line, encompassing events in Italy, Spain, the Mediterranean region, and France, the 'South European thread', and this book can be considered the starting novel of the 'South-Central/South-East thread' being set in southern Germany, Austria, Bavaria, and Bohemia. This geographically organized plot thread actually began in Ring of Fire in Flint's novelette 'The Wallenstein Gambit' which is set in Bohemia, Austria, and Germany, which tied into stories in various Grantville Gazettes.ContentsThe book is hard to classify as it is an oddity, as acknowledged by series creator Eric Flint in the foreword; an anthology in fact, with several longer novelettes sandwiching seemingly unrelated short stories under a (hidden for a while) overarching story line that is capped off by a short novel that finally brings all the seemingly unrelated and disparate contents together in the latter part of the book.Unlike most works in the 1632 series, much of this book is written from the standpoint of common people 'in the street', including Germans trying to cope with Grantville, West Virginia, up-timers trying to cope with their new world around Grantville, and both trying to deal with the problems of two widely different cultures meeting in the new United States of Europe. These merging dynamics are the milieu shaping stories Flint felt necessary to include even though they are set in 1631–1632. Their impact extends throughout the book and into 1634, as well as across political boundaries and battle lines as the historical imperatives developed in this book extend into the direct sequel 1634: The Bavarian Crisis.Plot summary The book spot-covers local events and a few related diplomatic discussions from a few days after the Ring of Fire (May–June 1631) to October in the fall of 1634—giving it the largest time footprint of the four—though narrowly focused. The short novel that concludes the work begins in late August 1633 and overlaps many of the shorter works earlier in the book. Two of the three other books set in 1634 refer to the events in the work (usually as the 'troubles in Franconia') setting its canonical place in the 'greater' neo-historical international politics covered in the other two works.'Recipes for Revolution' The two Larkin 'Birdie' Newhouse tales along with two flashback vignettes by Flint begin the Ram Rebellion book, all four set in the weeks immediately after the Ring of Fire. In the Flint stories which are sandwiched around the Birdie tales, Mike Stearns goes back to school under the tutelage of Melissa Mailey. Stearns has a problem, he has to get a handle on likely complications from the local population, as the stories are set just a few days after he is elected as Chairman of the Emergency Committee. As a result, Mailey gives Stearns several very thick history books on European history in the era.Birdie Newhouse has an immediate problem, he's a farmer with most of his farm's arable land 300 years off and a continent away. The stories by Gorg Huff and Paula Goodlett explore the alien land practices and ownership of down-time Germany as Birdie seeks to gain additional lands. Land sales are rare; worse, the lawyers are in control and there are three general levels of vested interest: The owners-in-fact, a variable number of other claimants, and the tenants. The tenants have certain rights and obligations over and above monetary rent while leases are generally for the lesser of three generations or 99 years. In between the owner in fact and the tenants is usually a monetary transaction which gives the rents to any number of claimants—depending upon the finances of the landholding family. The claimants all have a say in the farm operation to some extent, as do the occupants of the farm villages, which also have the right to disapprove or accept new co-farmers, for the land is farmed cooperatively with another set of obligations and entitlements. Birdie can't just go and buy a piece of land, he has to buy it from three different and diverse groups of people... and get them all to agree to terms. As the story notes, seventeenth century Germany was a lawyer's paradise.'Enter the Ram' Flo Richards is a farmer's wife with four grown children who had bought a small flock of type C Delaine Merino sheep and some angora rabbits before the Ring of Fire in the hope that she'd see more of her youngest daughter, Jen, once she'd finished her studies out of town. The Ring of Fire had consequently left Jan behind in the present in which Flo dealt with this loss by concentrating on her livestock. She and her husband JD have local Germans living with them as partners now that farming has become more labour-intensive. Flo's laments about the poor quality wool from the locally obtained ram (who comes to be known as Brillo for that reason) strike a chord with someone and subsequently a number of 'Brillo fables' start to appear in the local broadsheet; the fables concern the titular ram escaping from his pen and interfering with her merino breeding program. The ram's fame spreads through Grantville out into the rest of Germany. The Women's League of Voters uses a Ram's Head as its emblem, schoolchildren sing songs about Brillo, and even adapt it into a ballet.'The Trouble in Franconia' With the example of future Grantville, a peasant revolt becomes a revolutionary movement in the fractured Holy Roman Empire south and east of Thuringia while the Machiavellian maneuvers in the neo-historical governments and various field armies now dance to counter-act those aimed at the Americans' new heartland. Up-timers, from the original USA space-time want the serfs to succeed and liberate themselves—but also know what a bloodbath the French Revolution became and various individuals act to help one and prevent the others. Avoiding that path will take all sorts of resources and efforts, and Americans from both uptime and down-time act resolutely to mitigate the problems, diplomacy to head off wars headed by authoritarians threatened by the new American ideals, and a deft appreciation of when not to fight and dangle an irresistible carrot instead.'The Ram Rebellion' In Franconia, schoolteacher Constantin Ableidinger has been reading Common Sense by Thomas Paine. He also finds the Brillo stories interesting. The farmers in Franconia (and Thuringia for that matter) have a history of dissent concerning serfdom and Mike Stearns has hopes of getting some fundamental changes made in the way that Franconia is run as a result of a farmer's rebellion of sorts. He neglects to include this in the briefing given to the civil servants sent down to administer Franconia although these people, Johnny F. and Noelle Murphy, among others have an effect on the schoolteacher's 'Ram rebellion'.Literary significance and reception Dana Blankenhorn of ZDNet called the book 'a sort of open source novel' as a way of describing how Eric Flint invited other authors to contribute stories to this book in which it extends the franchise. Another reviewer wrote that 'the book gets mired down in detail.

The rebellion was led by Hans Koch, and it was a reaction to the oppressive taxation, labor requirements and agrarian injustice imposed by the rulers of the region. The origins of the rebellion can be traced back to 1622 when Hans Koch, a peasant from the city of Nuremberg, began preaching about social and agrarian reform. Koch, an advocate of Anabaptism, was deeply affected by the Thirty Years' War and the suffering it caused among the common people. This led him to organize a revolutionary organization of peasants that he named the 'Society of the Ram' after the ox mentioned in the Bible. Koch began to spread his message of reform throughout rural Germany, which soon led to open revolt. Many of the local rulers in the Franconian Circle tried to crush the rebellion with heavy-handed tactics. They imposed heavy taxes and introduced forced labor. This only served to increase the anger and resentment among the peasants, who then began openly attacking the ruling class. In 1634, the rebellion reached its peak when the peasants organized a successful attack on the castle at Neuburg. During the attack, the peasants captured the governor and forced him to sign a freedom declaration that promised the peasants rights to free speech, religious liberty and an end to oppressive taxation. This document, known as the Neuburg Declaration, served as an inspiration for similar uprisings elsewhere in Germany in the years to come. However, the victory was short-lived. The rebellion soon spread to other parts of Germany and was eventually put down with heavy losses. While Hans Koch escaped, many of his followers were arrested or killed. The Ram Rebellion was an important moment in German history. It was a demonstration of the peasant class' willingness to fight against oppressive policies imposed by the ruling class. Though ultimately unsuccessful, the rebellion inspired later uprisings and served as a reminder that the peasantry would not accept injustice without a fight.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 4543339}

The Spanish State Statistical Survey of 2013 found 296 male and 306 female residents.EtymologyThe settlement was named afterSan Isidro the farm-worker, the patron saint of farmers.HistoryReal Cortijo is notable because it was built as an experimental agricultural station in 1766 during the Enlightenment, which was inspired by King Carlos III, an enthusiastic physiocrat who was persuaded that the value of his kingdom lay more in its lands and people than in the gold and silver stored in its treasury.After the death of Carlos III, the Cortijo fell into decay, as his son, Carlos IV, showed little interest in agriculture. In 1868, during the reign of Isabel II, the farm was sold off.In 1944, after the civil war, the Spanish National Institute of Colonization sequestered the land. Previous owners and new settlers from various other provinces became tenants. The existing residential area was extended by the addition of newly built homes.In the 1950s local land and houses were sold to individuals. A royal decree of September 1957 formally established the local council as a legal entity.

It is mainly concerned with the concept of 'substantive identity' in which a particular being is constituted of a single essence, often referred to as a 'thing'. This philosophy was developed in the late twentieth century, and originally presented to the public in the book 'Things and Other Things: A Study of Substantive Identity' (1989). The book looks at the various questions of identity that arise when attempting to unify seemingly disparate parts of reality. Questions such as “in what sense an entity is the same as something else, or in what way is it distinct” are explored and discussed in great detail. The heart of the philosophy is the concept of substantive identity which asserts that each thing is composed of two distinct parts – the individual and the universal. Thus, each particular thing has its own identity based on its component parts, yet in some sense can still be seen as a part of something larger – the collective and infinite “otherness” of objects and events. This is often referred to as the “infinitely divisible identity” of things, or the “ontological puzzle of inter-particular relations”. In addition to the notion of substantive identity, Katz and his colleagues also discuss a related concept of “extrinsic difference”. This relates to the idea that each thing is not only intrinsically different from all other things, but it is also inextricably linked to all other things through its “other”. Thus, each individual object or event is intrinsically different, yet cannot exist independently, but must exist in relationship with all other things or events. Katz and his colleagues stress that rather than seeing things as existing independently, or existing in relation to the collective, we should consider them as existing in a dual relationship – both connected to and distinct from the universe of things and other things. Thus, in their view, the concept of “things and other things” helps us to understand the complexities of reality, and better understand the relationship between the particular and the universal. In conclusion, the philosophy of “Things and Other Things” provides a distinct framework for understanding the complexity of existence, and offers an alternative to more rigid philosophical conceptions of identity. By showing how each particular thing is linked to the greater whole, Katz and his colleagues demonstrate how we can better comprehend our relationship to the irrational and the infinite.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 46723020}

He was born in Devon, the son of an lawyer, and was educated at Exeter University. He practiced law in the courts of common pleas, the star chamber and King's Bench, and worked with many of the lawyers of his day, including William Noy and Sir Orlando Bridgeman. His legal career was highly successful as he debated and argued on a variety of cases in the most significant court of his time. He appeared in many of the leading cases, including the Somersett case, which granted freedom to a particular slave affirming his rights to life, liberty, and possession of property. At the time, England was governed by the monarchy of King Charles I, who had the deciding power and influence in the court proceedings. Prosecutors of the time had absolute power to make a case against a defendant and would often arbitrarily refuse to accept a plea or settlement from a defendant. Rolle was seen by many as a good role model for a fair-minded lawyer and challenged the prosecution's arbitrary decisions in court. As his influence spread, King Charles appointed him as counsel to the navy, a position he held until his death in 1660. Although Rolle was criticized for his legal decisions, he stood out in his network of friends and colleagues. He was known to be supportive of civil liberties and never lost sight of the equality he found in natural law. He was very highly respected by the English legal system and stands out as a significant figure in the development of English law. Rolle's work continues to influence the development of English law. Numerous books and articles have been written in his honour, and various foundations and trusts have been set up in his name. In the end, Robert Rolle was a respected lawyer, a proponent of justice, and a leader in the advancement of English law. He will forever be remembered for his contribution to the development of a fair and legal system in England.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 32285997}

Christie (born 1964) is a Professor of Medicine and Neuroscience at The University of Victoria. He helped found the Neuroscience Graduate Program at the University of Victoria and served as its director from 2010–2017. He is a Michael Smith Senior Scholar Award winner. Christie received his PhD in 1992 from the University of Otago before doing postdoctoral work with Daniel Johnston at Baylor College of Medicine and Terrence Sejnowski at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, and then becameAssistant Professor at the University of British Columbia. Promoted to Associate Professor in 2007. Full Professor in 2013.Research Christie's early research focused on heterosynaptic plasticity in the hippocampal formation. During the course of this work, he discovered that prior synaptic activity could impact the capacity for synapses to subsequently show activity-dependent forms of plasticity, a phenomenon that he originally called 'priming' but that has since been termed 'metaplasticity'. His Ph.D. work generated 9 publications on synaptic plasticity with Abraham. Following the completion of his Ph.D., he became interested in how calcium entered neurons, and began a post-doctoral fellowship with Dan Johnston. In this period he showed for the first time, using calcium imaging, that different types of voltage-gated calcium channels were not distributed homogeneously throughout neuron dendrites and somata. Moreover, he was able to show that certain types of voltage-gated channels played a preferential role in long-term forms of synaptic depression, or LTD. Despite lasting only 2.5 years, this post-doctoral fellowship generated 8 publications. In 1996, Christie turned down several job offers at Canadian institutions and moved to the Salk Institute to work with T. Sejnowski. While his aspirations for becoming more involved in the computational modeling the Sejnowski lab was known for were not realized, it was during this period that met Dr.'s Henriette van Praag and Fred 'Rusty'Gage and became interested in neurogenesis. Together these individuals published four influential publications on adult hippocampal neurogenesis, with Christie performing the majority of the electrophysiological recordings.Christie's research has shown that exercise promotes adult neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus.This work has since progressed to show that exercise can have beneficial effects for the brains of animals that have been exposed to ethanol while in the womb, an animal model of fetal alcohol syndrome effects. His current work continues to examine how exercise can benefit the brain. He is part of the Island Medical Program and the Division of Medical Sciences, a joint venture of the University of British Columbia and the University of Victoria to increase the number of medical doctors being trained in Canada, and teaches neuroanatomy and problem-based learning (PBL) in this program . His current research concentrates on how exercise generates new brain cells, enhances synaptic plasticity, and affects learning and memory processes in people with Alzheimer's Disease, stroke, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Disorder (FASD), Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). particularly in the hippocampus. This work is funded by a variety of organizations including NSERC, FRAXA, Azrieli, and CIHR. Christie also has an extensive research program focused on mild traumatic brain injury at the University of Victoria. He is the director of the concussion laboratory at UVic, which focuses on clinical research, but has also initiated an extensive pre-clinical research program around repeated mild traumatic brain injury and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) that is funded by CIHR. He has recently expanded the focus of his prenatal exposure research to include both prenatal cannabis and prenatal ethanol exposure, and is funded by CIHR to determine how prenatal exposure to these substances impacts learning and memory processes in the developing brain.

Christie has dedicated his research career to discovering and elucidating the mechanisms behind substance use disorder. He is currently working on elucidating dopamine- and glutamate-driven mechanisms underlying the neurobiological pliability contributing to the reinforcing effects of addictive drugs, including the homeostatic control of cell communication networks, the hedonic response associated with drug use, and the role of stress and reward in the treatment of addiction. Christie was born in Montréal, Canada, and received his B.Sc. from Concordia University. He then went on to obtain his PhD from the University of Saskatchewan, after which he moved to the University of Toronto in 1980 to pursue a post-doctoral fellowship focusing on brain circuitry. Shortly after that, he joined the faculty at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health. Over the past several decades, Christie's research has focused on uncovering the complexity behind substance use problems and exploring ways to disrupt the reinforcing effects of substances. He and his colleagues have developed and recommended a number of pharmacological and behavioural treatments for people with substance use problems. This includes medications such as naltrexone and ketamine, as well as a variety of psychotherapeutic approaches, such as cognitive-behavioural therapy and motivational interviewing. Christie has authored and co-authored several books and over 200 publications in peer-reviewed journals. He has served as an editor for a number of books, as well as a board member for scientific and clinical journals. He has also served as an advisor for Canada's National Institute on Drug Abuse, an expert advisory panel member of Vancouver’s drug strategy, and the Chairman of the National Advisory Council on Alcohol and Drug Abuse in Canada.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Syria–Turkey relations\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Turkey shares its longest common border with Syria; various geographic and historical links also tie the two neighbouring countries together.The traditionally tense relations between Turkey and Syria had been due to disputes including the self annexation of the Hatay Province to Turkey in 1939, water disputes resulting from the Southeastern Anatolia Project, and Syria's support for the Kurdistan Workers' Party (abbreviated as PKK) and the now-dissolved Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (abbreviated as ASALA) which has been recognised as a terrorist organisation by NATO, the EU, and many other countries. Relations improved greatly after October 1998, when PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan was expelled by the Syrian authorities. However, the Syrian civil war has once again strained relations between the two countries, leading to the suspension of diplomatic contact. A serious incident occurred with the Syrian downing of a Turkish military training flight in June 2012, resulting in Turkey calling an emergency meeting of NATO.Syria had maintained an embassy in Ankara and two consulates–general in Istanbul and Gaziantep. Turkey had an embassy in Damascus and a consulate–general in Aleppo. Diplomatic relations between the countries were severed in March 2012, due to the Syrian civil war. Turkey is a full member of the Union for the Mediterranean and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) while Syria's membership was suspended due to the civil war.HistoryTurkish rule pre-WWI Turkish dynasties managed to rule Syria and the region starting from the Tulunids in the late 9th century, followed by Ikhshidids, Seljuq Empire, Burid dynasty, Artuqids, and Zengids until late 12th century. In 1516, Syria was annexed by the Ottoman Empire until the WWI in the early 20th century.Hatay annexationIn 1938, the Sanjak of Alexandretta became independent from the French mandate of Syria as the Republic of Hatay, and following a referendum, 8 months later in 1939, it decided to join Turkey as the Hatay Province. This self-annexation was never recognized by Syria, which continues to show the Hatay Province of Turkey as part of Syria's territory on maps.At present, Syrians hold the view that this land is historically Syrian and was illegally ceded in the late 1930s to Turkey by France – the mandatory occupying power of Syria (between 1920 and 1946). The Turks remember Syria as a former Ottoman vilayet. In 1938, the Turkish Army went into the former Syrian Mediterranean province with French approval and expelled most of its Alawite Arab and Armenian inhabitants. Before this, Alawi Arabs and Armenians were the majority of the provincial population. For the referendum, Turkey crossed tens of thousands of Turks into Alexandretta to vote.In 1938, the province declared its independence from France and the following 29 June, the parliament of the newly declared Hatay Republic voted to join Turkey. This referendum has been labeled both 'phoney' and 'rigged', and that it was a way for the French to let Turks take over the area, hoping that they would turn on Hitler.Syrians still consider this land as integral Syrian territory. Syrians call this land Liwaaa aliskenderuna rather than the Turkish name of Hatay.Water politics Water disputes have been a major source of conflict as Turkey has constructed several dams on the Euphrates and Tigris rivers as part of the Southeastern Anatolia Project- GAP to develop the region. The project GAP was aimed at reducing the harsh living conditions of the Southeastern provinces of Turkey by building 19 dams on the rivers of Euphrates and Tigris. This project, however, would seriously reduce Syrian water resources.In addition to this, Euphrates and Tigris are not the only rivers that tangles Turkish-Syrian relations, the water distribution of Orantes River which pours into Mediterranean from the province of disputed Hatay also rises problems between two states.Support to the PKK Turkey has condemned Syria for supporting the PKK, which is listed as a terrorist organization internationally by a number of states and organizations, including the US, NATO, and the EU and has claimed that Syria employed Alois Brunner to train Kurdish militants for attacks against Turkey.The two countries came to the brink of war when Turkey threatened military action if Syria continued to shelter Abdullah Öcalan in Damascus, his long-time safe haven. Relations have improved since October 1998, when Öcalan was expelled by Damascus and Syria pledged to stop harbouring the PKK militants and the 1999 signing of the Adana agreement, following his subsequent capture in Kenya, envisaged security cooperation between the two countries.Helicopter downingIn October 1989, 2 Syrian Mig-21's flewinto Turkish airspace where they shot down a Turkish aircraft. All five of the crew on the Turkish aircraft died.Diplomatic thaw 2003–2011 In The New Turkey (Granta Books, 2005), BBC correspondent Chris Morris claims that Syria was 'for years a bitter foe' as 'Turkey's secular democracy, its application for EU membership and its close relationship with the United States have long been regarded in Tehran, Baghdad and Damascus with intense suspicion. Islamists look at the secular state which buried the caliphate and think 'betrayal'; and Arab nationalists still haven't forgotten that Turks are their former colonial rulers.' 'But there's been a thaw, especially since the AKP came to power,' and 'the new Turkish model – trying to mix greater democracy and Islam together – is now the subject of curiosity and not a little envy.'The Turkish Parliament's refusal to cooperate militarily with the 2003 invasion of Iraq was a turning point in Syrian-Turkish bilateral relations as Syria's perceptions of Turkey as incapable of acting independently were altered.The first ever visit to Turkey by a Syrian President was made by Bashar al-Assad to Ankara in January 2004. In late 2004, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan flew to Damascus to sign a free trade agreement, in the follow-up to former Turkish President Turgut Özal's high-level trade negotiations with Syrian authorities in the 1990s and Erdoğan's own recently successful bid to initiate a Turkish EU accession which would allow Europe, 'to extend its reach to the borders Syria, Iraq and Iran.' On 3 April 2007, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Syrian President Bashar Al Assad attended the opening ceremony of the Aleppo International Stadium.In 2005, Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer went to visit Damascus, despite U.S. objections, during the Cedar Revolution in Lebanon.In 2008, Turkey was, as a sign of mutual trust in Damascus and Jerusalem, invited to play the role of facilitator between Syria and Israel to solve their dispute over control over the Golan Heights, but these talks were abandoned after four rounds, which included a visit by Syrian President Bashir al-Assad to Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdoğan at Bodrum in August, following the deterioration in Turkey-Israel relations over the 2008–2009 Israel-Gaza conflict,Military cooperation On 26 April 2009, the two states announced an 'unprecedented' three-day military manoeuvre involving ground forces along their mutual border in what was described as 'a step further in their ever-expanding cooperation.' According to Turkish military sources, 'The aim of the exercise is to boost friendship, cooperation, and confidence between the two countries land forces, and to increase the ability of border troops to train and work together.'The exercise which commenced on 27 April involved teams from each country crossing the border to visit outposts.Visiting Syrian Defense Minister Hasan Turkmani and Turkish Defense Minister Vecdi Gönül also signed a letter of intent giving the green light for cooperation in the defence industry, on the sidelines of the 9th International Defence Industry Fair (IDEF'09) that commenced in Istanbul the same day, as a sign of the level of political relations reached between the two states, although a Turkish defence industry source emphasised that, 'it does not mean that the two countries will immediately enter into cooperation in arms production.'2009 Turkish Presidential visit to Syria Turkish President Gül's 15–17 May official visit to Syria was made at the invitation of Damascus in reciprocation of Syrian President Assad's 2007 official visit to Turkey. A senior Turkish diplomat confirmed that, 'The main topic on the agenda and the goal of the visit is the maintenance of momentum that has built up in bilateral relations within the last decade.' The Turkish delegation included Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu, Foreign Trade Minister Zafer Çağlayan, Agriculture Minister and Culture and Tourism Minister Ertuğrul Günay.Shortly before the visit new Syrian Ambassador to Turkey, Nidal Qablan confirmed that Syria was ready to restart the Turkish mediated peace negotiations with Israel and Gül supported the call, following his meeting with Assad, stating that, 'We have heard Syria say it is ready to resume the peace talks from the point where they stopped with the previous [Israeli] government. We in Turkey are also ready.' Assad confirmed, 'Turkey's role is important because we have trust in Turkey.' Israeli President Shimon Peres dismissed these calls stating, 'The Syrians should be ready to talk. If President al-Assad wants peace, why is he shy? We suggested direct talks many times. He thinks direct talks are a prize for Israel. It's not a prize. It's normal.'Friction due to Syrian Civil WarSince the start of Syrian Civil War, relations between Syria and Turkey greatly deteriorated. The Syrian conflict began to impact Turkey when at least 3,000 Syrian refugees fled Syria as a consequence of such incidents as Syrian army operation in Jisr ash-Shugur in June 2011. In June 2011, Turkish prime minister Erdogan described to Anadolu Agency, his feeling that 'They [Syria] are not acting in a humane manner. This is savagery.' However, at the beginning, the Turkish government refrained from describing the Syrians who fled to Turkey as 'refugees' or 'asylum-seekers', instead referring to them as guests, and Erdogan, while demanding the implementation of promised reforms by the Syrian government, initially refrained from calling for Bashar al-Assad's departure, although he later would.TimelineOn 9 August 2011, the BBC and other news sites reported that Turkey sent its foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoğlu, to Syria to give the government a 'tough' message. Erdogan has said that he is becoming impatient with the 'savagery' of Bashar al-Assad's government. Ahmet Davutoğlu also announced that 'We are completely suspending all of these trade relations, all agreements between Turkey and Syria have been suspended.'The Turkish pilgrim bus attack occurred on 21 November 2011 when two buses carrying Turkish pilgrims returning from Saudi Arabia came under fire from Syrian soldiers. The attack occurred at a checkpoint near Homs, as a convoy of eight or nine Turkish buses was making its way towards Turkey via the Bab Hawa border crossing. The gunfire left two people injured. According to a driver, when told that the passengers were Turks, 'Syrian soldiers emerged from behind sandbags and cursed Recep Tayyip Erdoğan... Then they suddenly opened fire at the bus.'On 9 April 2012, the Syrian envoy to Turkey was summoned after Syrian forces fired across the Syria–Turkey border. At least two were killed and many others injured in the incident.On 22 June 2012, Syria shot down a Turkish Air Force RF-4E reconnaissance jet near the Turkish-Syrian border. The Syrian military alleges the jet had violated Syrian airspace. However, Turkish president Abdullah Gül and other spokesmen have not confirmed this and emphasized that brief incursions into neighboring airspace by high-speed jets are routine occurrences. Gül stated that 'it is not possible to cover over a thing like this. Whatever is necessary will no doubt be done.' The Turkish and Syrian navies conducted a search for Turkish airmen downed by the incident.In August 2012, Turkey began to hold high level meetings with the USA on plans to replace the Syrian government.On 3 October 2012, Turkey attacked troops in Syria, after a Syrian mortar shell killed five people. Turkish parliament approved cross border operations. Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan announced 5 October 'We are not interested in war, but we're not far from it either,'On 10 October 2012, Turkish Air Force F-16s intercepted a Syrian Air Airbus A320, flight RB442 from Moscow to Damascus, in Turkish airspace and forced it to land at Ankara Esenboğa Airport, suspecting it was carrying Russian-made weapons. Inspectors confiscated military communications equipment and items 'thought to be missile parts'. Syria accused Turkey of 'air piracy'. On the same day the airline chief said in an interview that Turkey violated the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation Syria subsequently banned Turkish civilian flights from its airspace.On 23 October 2012, an anti-aircraft shell from Syria hit a health center in Turkey's Hatay Province.On 11 May 2013, two car bombs exploded in the town of Reyhanlı, Hatay Province, Turkey. At least 43 people were killed and 140 more were injured in the attack. The car bombs were left outside Reyhanlı's town hall and post office. The first exploded at around 13:45 local time (10:45 GMT) and the second exploded about 15 minutes later. People attempting to help those injured in the first explosion were caught in the second blast. This attack was the deadliest single act of terrorism to occur on Turkish soil.On 23 March 2014, Turkey shot down a Syrian combat jet in Hatay Province near Turkish-Syrian border. The initial announcement was made by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in a speech during the 2014 Turkish local elections campaign. Turkey claimed that two Turkish Air Force F-16s downed the plane that breached Turkish airspace and ignored warnings, as a result of the infringement of the new engagement rules declared by the Republic of Turkey, after Syria shot down a Turkish reconnaissance plane on 22 June 2012. The pilot jumped off the plane according to witness reports. Syria condemned the aggression and argued that the plane was following rebels and it did not violate Turkish airspace. However, according to the new engagement rules, two countries could defend themselves if the other come close to their borders, perceiving the action as a threat.On 18 June, based on information provided by a Euro-Med Monitor team, Turkish border guards have killed eleven Syrians, including four children and two women, while they were trying to cross the Turkish-Syrian border by opening the fire directly on them once they reached Syria's Idlib province. The Turkish government claimed that the authorities meant to kill the smugglers and terrorists not the civilians in search of protecting their borders. Some eyewitness testimonies from refugee families confirmed to the Euro-Med Monitor team that all the ones who were killed by the Turkish guards were civilians.Most of the deaths, reached to the borders, ran away from ISIS control before they got and hid in the northern Aleppo countryside for 15 days. Testimonies collected by Euro-Med Monitor team said that a smuggler help the victims get to the Syria's Idlib province. The victims were deceived by the smuggler when he told them that the Turkish borders are safe and gave them the legal permission to cross the borders. Turkish border guards have killed 60 Syrians before as they were trying to cross the border.On 24 August 2016, Turkey and Turkish backed rebels attacked ISIS positions across the border, from Jarabulus west to Al-Rai, taking a series of towns and taking a hold of a strip 5 to 20 km deep. Turkey called this operation Euphrates Shield.In recordings released in 2014, Turkish intelligence chief Hakan Fidan suggests that rockets should be fired from Syria into Turkey to justify military action in retaliation.In 2020, following the Balyun airstrikes, Turkey initiated Operation Spring Shield against the Syrian army.See alsoForeign relations of SyriaForeign relations of TurkeyLevant QuartetTurks in SyriaSyrians in TurkeyTurkish occupation of northern SyriaOperation Olive BranchSyria–Turkey barrierReferencesFurther readingAlam, Kamal.'The Assad-Erdogan Relationship: A Mirror into Syrian-Turkish Ties.'

For centuries, relationships between the two countries have fluctuated between periods of intense cooperation and periods of political and military tension, however, due to the unrest in Syria, tensions have once again been renewed. Historical Relations The two countries have had a complex and long history due to their complicated geography. Historically, Syria and Turkey have experienced periods of both harmony and hostility. During the Ottoman Empire, Syria was under Turkish control and consequently the two countries interacted closely. During the World Wars, Syria and Turkey opposed each other as Turkey was an ally to the Central Powers while Syria was controlled by the Allies. In the post-war period, Syria's on-going disputes over water supply from the Turkeys rivers led to animosity between the two. 1960s and Onward In the 1960s, Syrian–Turkish relations improved significantly. Both countries agreed on the Adana Agreement in 1998 to enhance economic ties, increase political cooperation, and negotiate Syrian-backed Kurdish groups in Turkey. During this period, ties between the two countries were also bolstered by the deep personal friendship between the Turkish Prime Minister Süleyman Demirel and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad. As well, each country sought to gain advantage from the other due to their unique natural resources, such as oil and water. 2010-present In the 2010s, the Syrian Civil War began and Turkey was amongst the first to recognize the Syrian National Council and the SyrianOpposition Coalition as the legitimate representatives of the Syrian people. After 2011, Turkey began to endure an influx of over three million Syrian refugees who escaped the war in Syria. Turkey has since spent around 30 billion dollars to support the refugees and maintain camps located in the country. As a result of its involvement in the Syrian Civil War, Turkey also became engaged in a power struggle with Russia and Iran which has been a significant factor weakening Syria–Turkey relations. Political and Economic Ties Currently, political and economic ties between Syria and Turkey remain strained. Politics between Syria and Turkey are heavily influenced by their respective alliances with other countries, such as Russia and the United States. However, Turkey still maintains a commercial and trade relationship with Syria. As of the beginning of 2021, a reported 110 Turkish companies were conducting business in Syria with Turkish exports to Syria estimated to be worth 825 million USD. Both respective leaders, Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and Bashar al-Assad of Syria, have expressed a desire for improved economic and political ties. During Erdogan's official visit to Damascus in October 2020, the Turkish and Syrian governments signed 6 cooperation agreements in hopes of rebuilding their relationship and promoting peace, stability, and economic development in the region. Despite the present period of tension, it is expected that future relations between Turkey and Syria will grow increasingly amicable as the countries have collectively agreed upon the paramount importance of peaceful cooperation. It is clear that in the past, Syria and Turkey have experienced both strong and turbulent relations. As current events continue to unfold, it remains uncertain what lies ahead for the future of diplomatic ties between the two nations.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 21411547}

Luca e i suoi compagni devono decidere se arrendersi o combattere un nemico formato da soldati italiani e austriaci accampati nella stessa zona.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Only Fools and Horses\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Only Fools and Horses.... is a British television sitcom created and written by John Sullivan. Seven series were originally broadcast on BBC One in the United Kingdom from 1981 to 1991, with sixteen sporadic Christmas specials aired until the end of the show in 2003. Set in working-class Peckham in south-east London, it stars David Jason as ambitious market trader Derek 'Del Boy' Trotter and Nicholas Lyndhurst as his younger brother Rodney Trotter, alongside a supporting cast. The series follows the Trotters' highs and lows in life, in particular their attempts to get rich. Critically and popularly acclaimed, the series received numerous awards, including recognition from BAFTA, the National Television Awards and the Royal Television Society, as well as winning individual accolades for both Sullivan and Jason. It was voted Britain's Best Sitcom in a 2004 BBC poll.Lennard Pearce appeared in the first three series as Del and Rodney's elderly grandad. After Pearce's death in 1984, the show replaced Grandad with Uncle Albert, the boys' great uncle, played by Buster Merryfield. From 1988 onwards, the show features regular characters in Del Boy and Rodney's love interests, Raquel (Tessa Peake-Jones) and Cassandra (Gwyneth Strong) respectively. Other recurring characters include car dealer Boycie (John Challis), road sweeper Trigger (Roger Lloyd-Pack), lorry driver Denzil (Paul Barber), spiv Mickey Pearce (Patrick Murray), Boycie's wife Marlene (Sue Holderness), and pub landlord Mike (Kenneth MacDonald).The show was not an immediate hit with viewers and received little promotion early on, but later achieved consistently high ratings, and the 1996 episode 'Time on Our Hands' (originally billed as the last episode) holds the record for the highest UK audience for a sitcom episode, attracting 24.3 million viewers. The series influenced British culture, contributing several words and phrases to the English language. It spawned an extensive range of merchandise, including books, videos, DVDs, toys, and board games. Episodes are frequently repeated on UKTV comedy channel Gold.A spin-off series, The Green Green Grass, ran for four series in the UK from 2005 to 2009. A prequel, RockChips, ran for three specials in 2010 and 2011. A special Sport Relief episode aired in March 2014, guest starring David Beckham. In July 2018, John Sullivan's son, Jim Sullivan, announced that a musical adaptation of the show was nearing completion and launched on 9 February 2019 at the Theatre Royal Haymarket, London.PlotDerek 'Del Boy' Trotter (played by David Jason), a South London 'fly' trader, lives in a council flat in a high-rise tower block, Nelson Mandela House, in Peckham, South London, with his much younger brother, Rodney (Nicholas Lyndhurst), and their elderly grandad (Lennard Pearce). Their mother, Joan, died when Rodney was young, and their father Reg absconded soon afterwards, so Del became Rodney's surrogate father and the family patriarch. Despite the difference in age, personality and outlook, the brothers share a constant bond throughout.The situation focuses mainly on their attempts to become millionaires through questionable get-rich-quick schemes and by buying and selling poor-quality and illegal goods. They have a three-wheeled Reliant Regal van and trade under the name of Trotters Independent Traders, mainly on the black market.Initially, Del Boy, Rodney and Grandad were the only regulars, along with the occasional appearances of roadsweeper Trigger (Roger Lloyd-Pack) and pretentious used car salesman Boycie (John Challis). Over time, the cast expanded, mostly in the form of regulars at the local pub The Nag's Head. These included pub landlord Mike Fisher (Kenneth MacDonald), lorry driver Denzil (Paul Barber), youthful spiv Mickey Pearce (Patrick Murray) and Boycie's flirtatious wife Marlene (Sue Holderness). After Grandad died following the death of actor Lennard Pearce, his younger brother Uncle Albert (Buster Merryfield) emerged and moved in with Del and Rodney, becoming a main character.The plots of many early episodes were primarily self-contained, with few plot-lines mentioned again, but the show developed a story arc and an ongoing episodic dimension in later series. Del and Rodney's quest for love is a recurring theme, which eventually resulted in them finding long-term love in the form of Raquel (Tessa Peake-Jones) and Cassandra (Gwyneth Strong) respectively; Del also has a son with Raquel, Damien (played by five actors, most recently Ben Smith). The Trotters finally become millionaires, lose their fortune, and then regain some of it.Cast and charactersMain cast and charactersDerek Edward 'Del Boy' Trotter (David Jason) — Del is a smooth-talking South London market trader, willing to sell anything to anyone to make money. Possessing a quick-wit and confidence that his younger brother mostly lacks, Del is devoted to his family, taking care of Rodney and Grandad on his own from the age of 16. Del is also known for his penchant for cultural faux pas, in particular his misuse of French phrases. Del never settled down with a woman until he met Raquel, with whom he had a son, Damien. Sullivan recalled that he had always been fascinated by the unlicensed traders who sold goods from suitcases in markets, and he based Del Boy on them. David Jason added other elements to the part, including Del's cheap gold jewellery and his camel coat. The inspiration was taken from a similar man he had known when working as an electrician. Jason was a relatively late candidate for the part: Jim Broadbent (who would later appear in a minor recurring role as DCI Roy Slater) and Enn Reitel were earlier preferences. At the time, Broadbent was appearing in Mike Leigh's play, 'Goose-Pimples', at the Hampstead Theatre in north London. The play was due to transfer to the West End, and consequently, Broadbent thought he would be unable to fit in with the filming schedule and turned down the part. It was only when producer Ray Butt saw a repeat of Open All Hours that Jason was considered and, despite concerns that Jason had not previously had a leading television role, and that he and Lyndhurst did not look like brothers, he was cast.Rodney Charlton Trotter (Nicholas Lyndhurst) — Rodney is Del's idealistic but socially awkward younger half-brother. Despite being more academically gifted than Del Boy (although only to the extent of two GCEs), Rodney lacks Del's charisma as well as the latter's duplicitous persona and as such is confined to being Del's dogsbody and sidekick. Orphaned when young, Rodney was raised by Del, and much of the friction between the two comes from Rodney's annoyance about his dependency on his brother and his sometimes immoral schemes, usually resulting in unsuccessful attempts to gain greater independence through girlfriends or through setting up his own businesses; he was only partially successful after marrying Cassandra and briefly going to work for her father. In contrast to Del, the part of Rodney was cast early, with Lyndhurst settled on quickly. Sullivan partly based Rodney on his own experiences: he, too, had a much older sibling and, like Rodney, claims to have been a dreamer and an idealist in his youth.Edward Kitchener 'Grandad' Trotter (Lennard Pearce) — Sullivan was fascinated by the idea of having a big age gap between Del Boy and his younger brother Rodney; the elderly character of Grandad, and later, Uncle Albert, gave the situation the voice of an old man who had seen it all. In casting the role of Grandad, Sullivan had in mind an actor similar to Wilfrid Brambell, who had played Albert Steptoe in Steptoe and Son, but chose not to use Brambell himself, thinking him too closely associated with Steptoe. After seeing Pearce's audition, Sullivan chose him immediately. Unkempt and absent-minded, although sometimes displaying a high intelligence, Grandad rarely left the flat or even moved from his armchair in front of two television sets. Despite his age he was invariably treated as a butler by Del and Rodney, often being assigned unsavoury jobs around the flat such as cooking meals. Pearce died in 1984 whilst filming the series four episode 'Hole in One' (several scenes were subsequently re-shot with Buster Merryfield) and Sullivan wrote a new episode, 'Strained Relations', which featured Grandad's funeral.Albert Gladstone Trotter (Buster Merryfield) — Shortly after the death of Lennard Pearce, it was decided that a new older family member should be brought in, which eventually led to 'Uncle Albert', Grandad's estranged younger brother. Merryfield was an inexperienced amateur actor at the time, but was selected because he appeared to fit the description of an old sailor, especially with his distinctive white 'Captain Birdseye' beard. Albert first appeared at Grandad's funeral, and soon moved in with Del and Rodney. His wartime experiences with the Royal Navy became one of the show's running gags, usually beginning with the words 'During the war...'. Merryfield died in 1999 and Albert's death was written into the next episode.Raquel Turner (Tessa Peake-Jones) — Raquel was introduced because Sullivan wanted more female characters and for Del to start meeting more mature women. Her first appearance, in 'Dates', was intended to be a one-off, but she was written in again a year later and thereafter became a permanent cast member. A trained singer and actress whose career never took off, she met Del through a dating agency, but they fell out over her part-time job as a stripper, before getting together again. This time she moved in with Del, helping to calm him, and they had a son together, named Damien. As the character unfolded, it was revealed that she was previously married to Del's rival, DCI Roy Slater.Cassandra Trotter (née Parry) (Gwyneth Strong) — Cassandra first met Rodney in 'Yuppy Love'. Their relationship blossomed, and by the end of series six the two had married. Cassandra's career-driven lifestyle caused fights with Rodney, and their troubled marriage was one of the main storylines later in the show's run.Supporting cast and charactersTrigger (Roger Lloyd-Pack) — A dopey and slow-witted but good friend of Del, Trigger was initially portrayed as a small-time thief, supplying Del with dubious goods. In later episodes he came to adopt the 'village idiot' role, and constantly calls Rodney 'Dave', much to Rodney's chagrin. Trigger, apparently so called because he looks like a horse, was the principal supporting character earlier in the show's run, although his importance lessened as the series progressed. Lloyd-Pack was cast by pure chance: Ray Butt, who hired him to portray Trigger after seeing him in a stage play, had only attended that play to observe potential Del Boy actor Billy Murray.Boycie (John Challis) — An untrustworthy used car salesman and a cultural elitist. Boycie, a freemason, was very selfish and prone to boasting about his wealth. Challis had played a similar character in an episode of Citizen Smith. Sullivan liked him, and promised to cast him in a future series, which led to Boycie. Boycie later featured in a spin-off series, The Green Green Grass, starting in 2005, in which he and his wife Marlene escaped from a criminal gang.Denzil Tulser (Paul Barber) — An affable Liverpudlian lorry driver, Denzil was often on the victim of Del's scams. His inability to say no to Del's business deals frequently led to arguments with his controlling wife, Corinne (Eva Mottley), who was only sighted once, in 'Who's a Pretty Boy?'. Corinne eventually walked out on him, leaving Denzil depressed but with more time to go along with Del's antics.Sid (Roy Heather) — Sid made sparse appearances throughout the show's run, mainly as the proprietor of the dirty and derelict local cafe. In the episode 'The Jolly Boys' Outing', it is revealed that Sid fought in the Second World War. He was captured and imprisoned but escaped, only for the boat he was using to be hit and sunk by a Greek fishing trawler being steered by Uncle Albert. After Nag's Head landlord Mike was imprisoned, Sid took over and kept that role for the remainder of the series.Mickey Pearce (Patrick Murray) — Mickey was a young, arrogant spiv and friend of Rodney's, known for his exaggerated boasts about his success in business or with women. Despite their friendship, Mickey often took advantage of Rodney's inexperience by stealing his girlfriends or making off with all the money from their business partnership.Marlene Boyce (Sue Holderness) — Boycie's wife. Initially just an unseen character, Marlene was popular among the boys and extremely flirtatious, having had implied sexual relations with all of Boycie's friends. She and Del have a noticeably close friendship, dating back to when Marlene worked in a betting shop in Lewisham Grove. Despite their constant arguments and insults, she and Boycie are in-love and eventually have a child, Tyler, although there are light-hearted rumours that Del may be the father.Mike Fisher (Kenneth MacDonald) — The landlord of the Nag's Head, although not from the very beginning; his predecessor was never seen, with just a succession of barmaids providing service. Friendly and gormless, he was often targeted by Del as a potential customer for any goods he was selling. When Kenneth MacDonald died in 2001, a storyline involving Mike's imprisonment for attempting to embezzle the brewery was written, and cafe owner Sid took over as the interim pub landlord.Damien Trotter (various) — Damien was Del and Raquel's son. It was Rodney's mocking suggestion that he be named Damien. Six actors played Damien: Patrick McManus (1991), Grant Stevens (1991), Robert Liddement (1992), Jamie Smith (1993–96), Douglas Hodge (1996, as adult), and Ben Smith (2001–03).Minor cast and charactersThe most frequent roles for guest actors in Only Fools and Horses were as Del or Rodney's once-seen girlfriends, barmaids at the Nag's Head, or individuals the Trotters were doing business with. Del and Rodney's deceased mother, Joan, though never seen, cropped up in Del's embellished accounts of her final words or in his attempts to emotionally blackmail Rodney. Her grave – a flamboyant monument – was seen occasionally. Their absent father, Reg, appeared once in 'Thicker Than Water' (played by Peter Woodthorpe), before leaving under a cloud, never to be seen again.Other members of the Trotter family were rarely sighted, the exceptions being cousins Stan (Mike Kemp) and Jean(Maureen Sweeney), who attended Grandad's funeral. In 'The Second Time Around', the woman they believed to be Auntie Rose (Beryl Cooke) turned out to be no relation at all but the woman who had moved into Rose's house some years earlier. After Rodney met Cassandra, her parents Alan (Denis Lill) and Pam (Wanda Ventham) became recurring characters. Raquel's parents, James and Audrey (Michael Jayston and Ann Lynn), appeared in 'Time On Our Hands', and it was James who discovered the antique watch which made the Trotters millionaires.In some episodes, a guest character was essential to the plot. Del's ex-fiancée Pauline (Jill Baker) dominated Del's libido in 'The Second Time Around', prompting Rodney and Grandad to leave. In 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire', Del's old business partner Jumbo Mills (Nick Stringer) wanted Del to return to Australia with him and restore their partnership, forcing Del to make a decision. An attempt by Lennox (Vas Blackwood) to rob a local supermarket set-up the 'hostage' situation in 'The Longest Night'. Del and Rodney spent the whole of 'Tea for Three' battling each other for the affections of Trigger's niece Lisa (Gerry Cowper), who briefly reappeared in 'The Frog's Legacy'. Abdul (Tony Anholt) in 'To Hull and Back' and Arnie (Philip McGough) in 'Chain Gang' were responsible for setting up dubious enterprises involving the Trotters in their respective episodes. Tony Angelino (Philip Pope), the singing dustman with a speech impediment, was the key to the humour and the storyline of 'Stage Fright' and EastEnders actor Derek Martin guest starred in 'Fatal Extraction'.Del's nemesis from his school days, corrupt policeman DCI Roy Slater (played by Jim Broadbent), made three appearances, in 'May The Force Be With You', 'To Hull and Back' and 'Class of '62'. Feared local villains, the Driscoll Brothers (Roy Marsden and Christopher Ryan) featured once, in 'Little Problems', but were mentioned in two previous episodes ('Video Nasty' and 'The Frog's Legacy'), and are important in the story of The Green Green Grass. A grown-up Damien (Douglas Hodge) appeared in 'Heroes and Villains'. Rodney and Mickey's friends, the smooth-talking Jevon (Steven Woodcock) and then, briefly, Chris (Tony Marshall), a ladies' hairdresser, featured sporadically during the sixth and seventh series and the intervening Christmas specials. The two-part 1991 Christmas special, 'Miami Twice', saw Richard Branson and Barry Gibb make cameo appearances. Mike Read appeared as himself, hosting an episode of Top Of The Pops, in 'It's Only Rock and Roll' and Jonathan Ross appeared as himself in 'If They Could See Us Now'.While their characters were less significant, well-known actors who played cameos in the programme included Joan Sims, best known for her numerous roles in the Carry On films, who guest-starred in the feature-length episode 'The Frog's Legacy' as an aunt of Trigger and old friend of Del's late mother; successful film actor David Thewlis, who played a young wannabe musician in 'It's Only Rock and Roll'; John Bardon, who played the role of Jim Branning in the soap opera EastEnders, as the supermarket security officer in 'The Longest Night'. Walter Sparrow, who appeared as Dirty Barry in 'Danger UXD', went on to appear in several Hollywood films.ProductionDevelopmentIn 1980, John Sullivan, a scriptwriter under contract at the BBC, was already well known as the writer of the sitcom Citizen Smith. It came to an end that year and Sullivan was searching for a new project. An initial idea for a comedy set in the world of football was rejected by the BBC, as was his alternative idea, a sitcom centring on a cockney market trader in working class, modern-day London. The latter idea persisted. Through Ray Butt, a BBC producer and director whom Sullivan had met and become friends with when they were working on Citizen Smith, a draft script was shown to the BBC's Head of Comedy, John Howard Davies. Davies commissioned Sullivan to write a full series. Sullivan believed the key factor in its being accepted was the success of ITV's new drama, Minder, a series with a similar premise and also set in modern-day London.Sullivan had initially given the show the working title Readies. For the actual title he intended to use, as a reference to the protagonist's tax and work-evading lifestyle, Only Fools and Horses. That name was based on a genuine, though very obscure, saying, 'only fools and horses work for a living', which had its origins in 19th-century American vaudeville. Only Fools and Horses had also been the title of an episode of Citizen Smith, and Sullivan liked the expression and thought it was suited to the new sitcom. He also thought longer titles would attract attention. He was first overruled on the grounds that the audience would not understand the title, but he eventually got his way.Filming and transmissionFilming of the first series began in May 1981, and the first episode, 'Big Brother', was transmitted on BBC One at 8.30 pm on 8 September that year. It attracted 9.2 million viewers and generally received a lukewarm response from critics. The viewing figures for the whole first series averaged at around 7 million viewers. According to an interview with John Challis in 2015, the viewing figure 'today would be very good but in those days wasn't considered great at all, so it was sort of put on the back burner for a bit – no particular plans for a second series'. The costumes for the first series were designed by Phoebe De Gaye. Del's attire was inspired by her going to car boot sales. She took Jason shopping in Oxford Street, and had him try a variety of suits. De Gaye purchased some gaily coloured Gabicci shirts, which were fashionable at the time and she thought 'horrible'. Del's rings and bracelet were made of fake gold and came from Chapel Market. Rodney's combat jacket came from the BBC's Costume Department, and De Gaye added a Yasser Arafat scarf purchased from Shepherd's Bush Market. De Gaye used Vaseline, make-up, and food to make Grandad's costume look dirty. The idea was that he never had his hat off, never dressed properly and usually had dirty pyjamas underneath his clothes.A second series was commissioned for 1982. This fared a bit better, and the first and second series had a collective repeat run in June 1983 in a more low-key time slot, but attracted a high enough viewing figure for Davies to commission a third series. From there, the show began to top the television ratings. Viewing figures for the fourth series were double those of the first. In early December 1984, during the filming of Series 4, Lennard Pearce suffered a heart attack and was taken to hospital. He died on 15 December, the day before he was due to return. Sullivan wrote Grandad's death into the series with the episode 'Strained Relations' which featured Del and Rodney's goodbye to Grandad. According to Sullivan, recasting Grandad was considered disrespectful to Pearce by the team, so it was decided that another older family member was to be cast. Buster Merryfield was then cast as Grandad's brother Albert. The scenes from 'Hole in One' that featured Pearce were re-filmed with Merryfield.Midway through the filming of the fifth series, Jason told Sullivan that he wished to leave the show in order to further his career elsewhere. Sullivan thus wrote 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?', which was intended to be the final episode and would see Del accepting a friend's offer to set up business in Australia, leaving Rodney and Albert behind. Plans were made for a spin-off entitled Hot-Rod, which would have followed Rodney's attempts to survive on his own with help from Mickey Pearce, but leaving open the prospect of Del's return. Jason then changed his mind, and the ending of the episode was changed to show Del rejecting the offer.Sullivan had a tendency to write scripts that were too long, meaning a lot of good material had to be cut. Shortly before filming of the sixth series began, he and Jason requested that the show's time slot be extended and it was agreed to extend its running time to 50 minutes. This required a 40 per cent increase in the show's budget, and coincided with the show's becoming one of the BBC's most popular programmes. Robin Stubbs became the costume designer for the sixth series, and was responsible for getting Del's attire to match his new yuppy image. His new suits cost around £200 each and were purchased from Austin Reed in Regent Street. The rest came from stores such as Tie-Rack and DickinsJones. His jewellery was replaced each series because it was very cheap (the rings with 'D' cost 50p each).The seventh series aired in early 1991. Jason and Sullivan were involved with other projects, and it was confirmed that there were no plans for a new series. Despite this, the show continued in Christmas specials until 1993. Sullivan nonetheless wanted a final episode to tie up the show. In late 1996, three more one-hour episodes were filmed, to be broadcast over Christmas 1996. All three were well received and, due to the ending, were assumed to be the last. The show made a return in Christmas 2001 with the first of three new episodes which were shot together but ultimately broadcast over three consecutive Christmases from 2001 until 2003. Despite rumours of further episodes, in a 2008 interview, Sullivan was quoted as saying: 'There will not be another series of Only Fools And Horses. I can say that. We had our day, it was wonderful but it is best to leave it now'. Though Sullivan died in 2011, it returned for a special Sport Relief episode in 2014.Theme music and titlesOnly Fools and Horses has separate theme songs for the opening and closing credits, 'Only Fools and Horses' and 'Hooky Street', respectively. The original theme tune was produced by Ronnie Hazlehurst and recorded on 6 August 1981 at Lime Grove Studios. Alf Bigden, Paul Westwood, Don Hunt, John Dean, Judd Proctor, Eddie Mordue, and Rex Morris were hired to play the music. The tune was changed after the first series, and the new one was written by John Sullivan (he disliked the tune for the first series, and his new one explained the show's title), and Hazlehurst conducted it. It was recorded at Lime Grove on 11 May 1982, with musicians John Horler, Dave Richmond, Bigden, and Proctor. Sullivan had intended ChasDave to sing it because they had enjoyed success with the 'Rockney' style, a mixture of rock n' roll and traditional Cockney music. Sullivan was persuaded to do it himself by Ray Butt. Despite the creation of a new theme tune, the original one remained in occasional use. ChasDave did later contribute to the show, performing the closing credits song for the 1989 episode 'The Jolly Boys' Outing'. Both songs are performed by Sullivan himself, and not – as is sometimes thought – by Nicholas Lyndhurst.The opening credits see images of the three principal actors peel on and off the screen sequentially. These appear over a background of still photographs of everyday life in South London. The sequence was conceived by graphic designer Peter Clayton as a 'metaphor for the vagaries of the Trotters' lifestyle', whereby money was earned and quickly lost again. Clayton had also considered using five-pound notes bearing Del's face. The action was shot manually frame by frame, and took around six weeks to complete. Clayton knew that it was important to have the characters established in the titles, and prepared a storyboard depicting his ideas using drawings. He photographed various locations with a photographer, and the titles were shot using a rostrum camera and not edited. Brian Stephens, a professional animator, was hired to create the labels' movement.Clayton returned to the show when the closing credits were changed for 'Christmas Crackers'. He re-cut the entire sequence and added Christmas items. Another change was made necessary by Lennard Pearce's death and Buster Merryfield joining the cast, so the pictures of David Jason and Nicholas Lyndhurst were updated too. The sequence was shot on motor drive.The closing credits for the programme varied series by series. The first series used peeling labels featuring the names of the cast and crew, mirroring the opening sequence, but these had to be updated with every new episode, making the process very time-consuming; from the second series the credits switched to a standard rolling format. The third series featured additional symbols. For the fourth series, these designs were replaced with white lettering on a black background. The fifth series had a black and white background, but the sixth series reverted to the black one. For the seventh series, the credits scrolled against a freeze frame of the final scene.Filming locationsThe original 'Nelson Mandela House' in the titles was Harlech Tower, Park Road East, Acton, London. From 1988 onwards, Whitemead House, Duckmoor Road, Ashton in Bristol was used. The tower block is located behind Ashton Gate, the home ground of Bristol City Football Club, with some scenes filmed in the stadium's carpark.EpisodesSixty-four episodes of Only Fools and Horses, all written by John Sullivan, were broadcast on BBC1 from 8 September 1981 until 25 December 2003. The show was aired in seven series (1981–1983, 1985–1986, 1989 and 1990–1991), and thereafter in sporadic Christmas special editions (1991–1993, 1996, 2001–2003). All earlier episodes had a running time of 30 minutes, but this was extended after Series Six (1989), and all subsequent episodes had a running time ranging from 50 to 95 minutes.Several mini-episodes were produced. An eight-minute episode aired on 27 December 1982 as part of a show hosted by Frank Muir, The Funny Side of Christmas, and attracted 7.2 million viewers. A 5-minute spoof BBC documentary was shown on Breakfast Time on 24 December 1985, with Del being investigated by a BBC consumer expert. An educational episode named 'Licensed to Drill', in which Del, Rodney and Grandad discuss oil drilling, was recorded in 1984 but only shown in schools. A 5-minute 1990–91 Persian Gulf War special (dated 1 December 1990) has Del, Rodney, and Albert convey a message to British troops serving in the conflict. It has never been broadcast commercially, but a copy exists at the Imperial War Museum, London. A Comic Relief special showing Del, Rodney and Albert making an appeal for donations was shown on 14 March 1997, with 10.6 million viewers. A Sport Relief special was aired on 21 March 2014.Only Fools and Horses had two producers: Ray Butt from 1981 to 1987, and Gareth Gwenlan thereafter. Seven directors were used: Martin Shardlow directed all episodes in series one, Bernard Thompson directed the 1981 Christmas special, Susan Belbin series four, and Mandie Fletcher series five. Butt directed series three and five, as well as the 1985, 1986 and 1987 Christmas specials. Tony Dow became the established director after 1988, directing all subsequent episodes, bar the first part of Miami Twice, which was directed by Gareth Gwenlan. John Sullivan was executive producer on seven of the final eight episodes.DocumentariesA BBC documentary titled 'The Story of Only Fools and Horses' aired in December 2002. A six-part documentary series also titled 'The Story of Only Fools and Horses', began on 29 August 2017 on Gold and finished on 3 October 2017. The series features rare and unseen footage from the archives and specially re-created moments from Del Boy's family and friends. On 27 December 2020, a special called 'We Love Only Fools and Horses' was broadcast on Channel 5 in which various fans, actors and crew recalled the story of the series and why the show is still popular.Spin-offsThe Green Green GrassA spin-off of Only Fools and Horses entitled The Green Green Grass, also written by John Sullivan and directed by Tony Dow, was first aired in the UK in September 2005. Sullivan had considered writing a sitcom around the popular characters of Boycie and Marlene (John Challis and Sue Holderness) since the mid-1980s, but it was not until the series finally ended that the idea came to fruition. The Green Green Grass saw Boycie and Marlene forced to leave Peckham by one-time Only Fools and Horses villains, the Driscoll Brothers, and included guest appearances by Denzil (Paul Barber) and Sid (Roy Heather). A second series of The Green Green Grass was broadcast in the UK in October 2006, a third in November 2007 and a fourth in January 2009.RockChipsIn 2003, it was reported that Sullivan was developing a prequel to the original series, Once Upon a Time in Peckham, which would feature Del as a youngster in the 1960s, and have a prominent role for his parents. In 2009, it was again reported that the BBC were considering commissioning the show, although nothing was confirmed. On 5 April 2009, Sullivan said that he was planning a prequel to Only Fools and Horses which would star Nicholas Lyndhurst as Freddie 'The Frog' Robdal, a local criminal and Rodney's biological father; Robdal was the focus of the episode 'The Frog's Legacy'.On 3 July 2009, the BBC revealed that the title of the spin-off would be Sex, DrugsRock ‘n’ Chips, and would be a 90-minute comedy drama. The title was subsequently changed to RockChips. Filming began in August 2009, and it was shown on BBC One at 9pm on 24 January 2010. In October 2009 it was confirmed that Lyndhurst would star as Robdal. The Inbetweeners and Off The Hook actor James Buckley played the role of the young Del Boy.Home mediaThe show has been released on VHS, DVD and audio CD in several guises. A DVD collection containing every episode was issued, along with various other special edition box-sets, such as a tin based on their Reliant Regal. Videos and DVDs of Only Fools and Horses continue to be among the BBC's biggest-selling items, having sold over 1 million VHS copies and 6 million DVD copies in the UK.The series made its debut on Blu-ray on 6 December 2021, with a three-disc set entitled Only Fools and Horses: The 80s Specials. It featured the five feature length Christmas specials broadcast from 1985 to 1989, restored and remastered in high-definition. For the restoration process, the original 16mm film elements were cleaned and rescanned, while the standard-definition videotape elements were 'digitally reprocessed' and upscaled to HD. On the set, the episode 'A Royal Flush' is featured both in its original and 'writer's cut' versions; previously unreleased footage from 'The Jolly Boys' Outing' is included; and various photo galleries, a booklet and artcards are also included.In other mediaAudioFour episodes ('The Long Legs of the Law', 'A Losing Streak', 'No Greater Love' and 'The Yellow Peril') were re-edited for audio purposes and released on audio cassette on 12 October 1998. The cassette was re-released in October 2000.TheatreA four-minute show named 'Royal Variety Performance' was shown on 27 November 1988 (viewed by 18.14 million people) and had Del, Rodney, and Albert appear on the Royal Variety Show. It was staged on 24 November 1986, and the plot saw David Jason, Nicholas Lyndhurst and Buster Merryfield appear on stage in character, thinking that they are delivering boxes of alcohol to an associate of Del's, only later realising where they actually are. They also mistake the Duchess of York for Del's associate.An idea of an Only Fools and Horses stage show was mooted by Ray Butt, following the success of other sitcom crossovers such as Dad's Army and Are You Being Served?. Sullivan was not keen, owing to his work on Just Good Friends as well as Only Fools and Horses, and inexperience with the theatre, so nothing came of it.Stage musicalIn July 2018, John Sullivan's son, Jim Sullivan, announced that an Only Fools and Horses musical was nearing completion, with a script by Jim Sullivan and Paul Whitehouse. Jim Sullivan said, 'Back in 2010 my Dad had been toying with the possibility of a stage show but sadly didn’t get the chance to commit to it. In 2015 we met with the producer, Phil McIntyre, and agreed to develop the idea.Soon after that, Paul Whitehouse came on board and things have been bubbling away ever since. I am very pleased and excited to say that the show will be launching early next year.' The musical launched on 9 February 2019 at the Theatre Royal Haymarket, London.BooksOnly Fools and Horses spawned many merchandising spin-offs. Several books have been published, such as 'The Only Fools and Horses Story' by Steve Clark and 'The Complete A-Z of Only Fools and Horses' by Richard Webber, both of which detail the history of the series. The scripts have been published in a three-volume compendium, 'The Bible of Peckham'.In October 2015, He Who Dares..., a fictional autobiography, was published by Ebury Press. The book was written by John Sullivan's son, Jim Sullivan.In August 2017, Only Fools and Horses: The Peckham Archives, was published by Ebury Press. The book was written by Rod Green, with the help of Jim Sullivan.In November 2018, You Know It Makes Sense, Lessons From The Derek Trotter School of Business (And Life), was published by Ebury Press. The book was written by John Sullivan's son, Jim Sullivan.Board gamesTwo board games based on the show were released: a Monopoly-style game, the 'Trotters Trading Game', in which participants attempt to emulate the Trotters and become millionaires, and another game set in their local pub, entitled the 'Nag's Head Board Game'.ReceptionOnly Fools and Horses is one of the UK's most popular sitcoms. It was among the ten most-watched television shows of the year in the UK in 1986, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1996, 2001, 2002 and 2003. The 1996 Christmas trilogy of 'Heroes and Villains', 'Modern Men' and 'Time on Our Hands' saw the show's peak. The first two attracted 21.3 million viewers, while the third episode – at the time believed to be the final one – got 24.3 million, a record audience for a British sitcom. Repeat episodes also attract millions of viewers, and the BBC has received criticism for repeating the show too often.Only Fools and Horses won the BAFTA award for best comedy series in 1985, 1988 and 1996, was nominated in 1983, 1986, 1989, 1990 and 1991, and won the audience award in 2004. David Jason received individual BAFTAs for his portrayal of Del Boy in 1990 and 1996. The series won a National Television Award in 1997 for most popular comedy series; Jason won two individual awards, in 1997 and 2002. At the British Comedy Awards, the show was named best BBC sitcom for 1990, and received the People's Choice award in 1997. It also won the Royal Television Society best comedy award in 1997 and two Television and Radio Industries Club Awards for comedy programme of the year, in 1984 and 1997. John Sullivan received the Writers' Guild of Great Britain comedy award in 1997.The show regularly features in polls to find the most popular comedy series, moments and characters. It was voted Britain's Best Sitcom in a 2004 BBC poll, and came 45th in the British Film Institute's list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes. It was 3rd on a subsequent viewers' poll on the BFI website. Empire magazine ranked Only Fools and Horses #42 on their list of the 50 greatest television shows of all time. It was also named the funniest British sitcom of all time through a scientific formula, in a study by Gold. Scenes such as Del Boy's fall through a bar flap in 'Yuppy Love' and the Trotters accidentally smashing a priceless chandelier in 'A Touch of Glass' are recognisable comedy moments, invariably topping polls of comedy viewers. Del Boy was voted the most popular British TV character of all time in a survey by Open.... and in a 2001 Channel 4 poll he ranked fourth on their list of the 100 Greatest TV Characters. A Onepoll survey found that Only Fools and Horses was the television series Britons would most like to see return.RatingsCultural impactIn addition to its mainstream popularity, Only Fools and Horses has developed a cult following. The Only Fools and Horses Appreciation Society, established in 1993, has a membership of around 7,000, publishes a quarterly newsletter, Hookie Street, and organises annual conventions of fans, usually attended by cast members. The Society has also organised an Only Fools and Horses museum, containing props from the series, including Del's camel coat and the Trotters' Ford Capri. It was named one of the top 20 cult television programmes of all-time by TV critic Jeff Evans. Evans spoke of:Only Fools and Horses – and consequently John Sullivan – is credited with the popularisation in Britain of several words and phrases used by Del Boy, particularly 'Plonker', meaning a fool or an idiot, and two expressions of delight or approval: 'Cushty' (from the Roma word for 'good')and 'Lovely jubbly'. The latter was borrowed from an advertising slogan for a popular 1960s orange juice drink, called Jubbly, which was packaged in a pyramid shaped, waxed paper carton. Sullivan remembered it and thought it was an expression Del Boy would use; in 2003, the phrase was incorporated into the new Oxford English Dictionary.Owing to its exposure on Only Fools and Horses, the Reliant Regal van is often linked with the show in the British media. The one used by the Trotters has attained cult status and is currently on display at the Cars of the Stars exhibition at the National Motor Museum, alongside many other vehicles from British and American television and movies, such as the Batmobile and the DeLorean from Back to the Future. Boxer Ricky Hatton, a fan of the show, purchased one of the original vans in 2004. Another of the vans used in the series was sold at auction in the UK for £44,000 in February 2007.During the media frenzy surrounding The Independent”'s revelations that the new bottled water Dasani, marketed by Coca-Cola, was in fact just purified tap water from Sidcup, mocking parallels were made with the Only Fools and Horses episode, 'Mother Nature's Son', in which Del sells tap water as 'Peckham Spring'.Rose Tyler's father Pete Tyler is referred to as 'a bit of a Del Boy' in the 2005 Doctor Who episode 'Father's Day'.In the closing ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics, the Trotters' yellow Reliant van appeared on stage, along with Del Boy and Rodney body doubles dressed as Batman and Robin, a reference to the Only Fools and Horses episode 'Heroes and Villains'.International remakes Only Fools and Horses was sold to countries throughout the world. Australia, Belgium, Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Israel, Malta, New Zealand, Pakistan, Portugal, South Africa, Spain and Yugoslavia are among those who purchased it. In all former Yugoslav countries in which Serbian or Croatian is spoken the title was Mućke (or Мућке in Cyrillic script), which can roughly be translated as 'shady deals'. This translation was also used in Macedonia, where the show was titled Spletki (Сплетки in Cyrillic). In Slovenia, however, the show was titled Samo bedaki in konji, which is a literal Slovenian translation of the original English title. The show has enjoyed particular popularity in the former Yugoslavia, and is regarded as a cult series in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia and Slovenia.A number of overseas re-makes have also been produced. A Dutch version aired for one series in 1995, entitled Wat schuift't? ('What's it good for?'). The Trotters were renamed the Aarsmans and it starred Johnny Kraaykamp jnr. as Stef (Del), Sacco Van der Made as Grandad and Kasper van Kooten as Robbie (Rodney), and was shown on RTL 4. A Portuguese re-make, O Fura-Vidas, a local expression for someone who lives outside the law, ran for three series from 1999 to 2001. It was a literal translation of the British version, with all episodes based on the originals. It centred on the Fintas family, who live in Sapadores, a neighbourhood in Lisbon, and starred Miguel Guilherme as Quim (Del), Canto e Castro as Grandad, and Ivo Canelas as Joca (Rodney). In this Portuguese version the Reliant's equivalent was a 1988 Suzuki Super Carry. A Slovenian re-make, called Brat bratu (Brother to Brother), was broadcast from 2008 to 2009. All episodes were based on the original British storylines, and it was made in co-operation with John Sullivan. It featured brothers Brane (Brane Šturbej) and Bine (Jure Drevenšek), who moved from Maribor to Ljubljana. The series also stars Peter Ternovšek as Grandad. It was directed by Branko Đurić. The series was cancelled after thirteen episodes due to poor ratings.There have been several plans to produce an American version. One was to be a star vehicle for former M*A*S*H actor Harry Morgan, with Grandad rather than Del becoming the lead character. The other, entitled This Time Next Year..., would have seen the Trotters renamed the Flannagans. A draft script was written for the latter, but neither show materialised. In 2010 Steve Carell, star of the US version of The Office, expressed an interest in making an American version of the series, with him to star as Del Boy. In January 2012 US network ABC commissioned a pilot of an Only Fools and Horses remake titled 'King of Van Nuys', written by Scrubs writers Steven Cragg and Brian Bradley. It was developed, rejected and then redeveloped, only to be rejected again later in the year. The pilot starred John Leguizamo as Del, Dustin Ybarra as his brother Rodney and Christopher Lloyd as Grandad.A parody called Only Jerks and Horses” was written by David Walliams and Matt Lucas and directed by Edgar Wright in 1997.NotesReferencesExternal linksOnly Fools and Horses at FacebookOnly Fools and Horses at UKTV GoldOnly Fools and Horses at British TV Comedy GuideOnly Fools and Horses Appreciation SocietyAudio interviews with the cast, and photos from an Only Fools and Horses Day in Swindon in 2004 at ***BBC WiltshireFilming locations from Only Fools and Horses1981 British television series debuts 2003 British television series endings 1980s British sitcoms 1990s British sitcoms 2000s British sitcoms BAFTA winners (television series) BBC Radio comedy programmes BBC television sitcoms English-language television shows Peckham Television shows shot in Bristol Television series about brothers Television series about dysfunctional families Television shows set in London Television series by BBC Studios", "machine_text": " Only Fools and Horses is a British sitcom created and written by John Sullivan. The show ran from 1981 to 2003 and had a total of 64 episodes. Set in the rough part of London known as Peckham, it follows the stories of two ambitious but down-on-their-luck brothers, Rodney and Del Boy Trotter, as they attempt various get-rich-quick scams and schemes, and navigate a world of colorful characters. The show was popular with not only the British viewing public, but also in other parts of the world. It was the most watched television show in the UK at its peak, with over 24 million viewers tuning in for its final episode. It was also a hit overseas, in Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, and other countries. The show stars David Jason as Del Boy, Nicholas Lyndhurst as Rodney, and Lennard Pearce as Grandad. Many of the characters also had recurring roles, such as Boycie (John Challis), Trigger (Roger Lloyd-Pack), Denzil (Paul Barber), and Rodney's so-called better half, Cassandra (Gwyneth Strong). The Trotters' main plight throughout the series is to become millionaires. As Del Boy often puts it, they 'make a profit out of thin air' and have been doing so since the pilot episode. However, their plans usually come crashing down in the end, leading to a hilarious finale that often closes with the catchphrase 'This time next year, we'll be millionaires!'. Throughout its run, Only Fools and Horses received many awards, including Best Comedy Series at the 1998 British Comedy Awards. The entire series was released on DVD in the UK in 2006. Despite ending in 2003, the show still lives on in popular culture. Merchandise featuring the show's logo and characters are still being produced and sold today.

At first the church was to be named Tempio della Pace, to remember and honour the fallen of World War I. Construction began in May 1920. The original design proposed by Marcello Piacentini was inspired by the churches built in Rome in the 16th century.Construction halted with the death of Ottavio Gasparri, in 1929. In the next two years Piacentini changed radically the project, being inspired by the emerging Rationalist movement, and the Sacro Cuore di Gesù marked the turning point of the sacred architecture in Rome. The construction started again in 1931 and the church was inaugurated in 1934.The church became a parish church under Pope Pius XI on 31 October 1926 with the apostolic constitution Regis pacifici. On 5 February 1965 was declared titular church by Pope Paul VI with the apostolic constitution Sacrum Cardinalium Collegium. Later that year, with the motu proprio Recentioris architecturae the church became a minor basilica.DesignThe church has a brick façade with alternate courses raised and recessed; the façade is capped with travertine and the doors and windows are framed with the same material. The floor plan, with a central nave of approximately 70 metres in length and flanked by two aisles, is a hybrid of a Latin cross and a Greek cross. The hemispherical dome is 36 metres high and 20 metres in diameter. Over the main portal there is a high relief by Arturo Martini depicting the sacred heart of Jesus. Around the interior are the Stations of the Cross in bronze by Alfredo Biagini.ReferencesLuigi Monzo: trasformismo architettonico – Piacentinis Kirche Sacro Cuore di Cristo Re in Rom im Kontext der kirchenbaulichen Erneuerung im faschistischen Italien, in: Kunst und Politik.

The encyclical was a response to rising Atheism and secularism in Europe and the world in the early 20th century. Pius XI's goal was to place the emphasis upon the Sacred Heart of Jesus in order to counter the adverse worldviews of the time. The purpose of the devotion was twofold: to bring the entire world to recognize and recognize the love of Christ and to bring about a spiritual revival in the hearts of the believers. It is also a sign of hope for those who have never been aware of the love of Christ and his salvation message. The basic idea outlined in the encyclical is that the Everlasting Father, Jesus Christ, the King of Heaven, and the Sacred Heart of Jesus are the 'three things unites us to the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, who are one and indivisible.' The encyclical then explains why it is necessary for the faithful to recognize and venerate the love of Christ: to restore the faith in an atheistic and materialistic world. To this end, the work included three sections, I, II and III, which outlined the divine attributes of Jesus, promoted the modality of devotion, and encouraged a proper veneration of the Sacred Heart. Since its introduction, the devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus has become one of the most popular devotions in the Church. Its widespread appeal is attributed to its simplicity; it is easy to understand, simple to practice and offers comfort and hope to those who practice it. The devotion of Sacro Cuore di Cristo Re encourages people to pray for others, to strive for unity and justice among people, and to promote charity, a renewed love for the Blessed Sacrament, and an adherence to the Church. In addition to the practice of personal devotion to the Sacred Heart, the devotion also established an external component in the form of prayer groups, processions, and solemn celebrations, especially on the feast of Christ the King. Sacro Cuore di Cristo Re has greatly contributed to the spiritual life of the Church for more than 90 years and continues to be practiced in the devout Christian community to this day. It is a powerful reminder that the love of Christ wills unite us to the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, and help us to attain eternal life with Him forever.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 30234394}

It was one of the finest examples of Baroque architecture in The Netherlands.Today, only part of the outbuildings remain and are known locally as De Nederhof.History The village of Honselersdijk already had a small castlein the Middle Ages. In the 16th century it belonged to the princes of Arenberg, but they were on the Spanish side on the Eighty Years' War, and it was expropriated by the Province of Holland and put it at disposal of prince Maurice of Orange. His younger brother, prince Frederick Henry bought the castle in 1612 to use it as hunting lodge and summer mansion. It became his primary country house and showplace of his power. The medieval castle was torn down and was replaced between 1621 and 1647 by a new moated house and gardens inspired by the French architecture of the palais de Luxembourg, but with distinct Dutch features.After the death of his father, Prince William II completed the building of the house, although only a few of the planned extensions, such as galleries and pavilions, were created. UnderWilliam III and Mary the gardens were renovated and the house was adapted to the needs of its time (e.g. introduction of the sash window). The house was a rallying point for the various crossings to England or entrances to the city of The Hague.After the death of king-stadtholder William III the house was claimed by his cousin, king Frederick I in Prussia, just as various other country houses and palaces. The Prussian king and his family mostly lived in Berlin and because of an ongoing dispute about the inheritance with the King-Stadtholders sole heirs in the Frisian Nassau branch, little or no maintenance was taken up and the house fell into disrepair. Due to negotiations between Frederick II the Great and Anne, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange, the house was sold to her son prince William V in 1754. There were plans for renovation, but considered too expensive. William V occasionally used the house only for hunting purposes. The last real residents were his sister princess Carolina and her husband Karl Christian, Prince of Nassau-Weilburg between 1760 and 1765.During the French occupation the House was confiscated in 1795 and fell into decay. It was used as prison and hospital. After the restoration in the Netherlands in 1813, king William I was not inspired to save the house and it was demolished in 1815.Currently, only part of the outbuildings remains, the ‘Nederhof’ (the lower courtyard), which was used as stables and guest quarters. Since its restoration in 1976, it is used as a foster home.Art and architecture Prince Frederick Henry and his wife princess Amalia of Solms-Braunfels introduced the classical architecture in the Netherlands by building various large country houses and gardens, such as Huis Honselaarsdijk, Huis ter Nieuwburg and Huis ten Bosch. These house were inspired on French and Italian architecture, such as the Palais du Luxembourg in Paris and the Versailles palace of king Louis XIII.With help of their secretary, Constantijn Huygens, Frederick Henry and Amalia selected architects Jacob van Campen and Pieter Post as their architects for the house. But they were also supported by several French artists such as the architect Simon de la Vallée and the gardener André Mollet. For the interior various artists were involved such as Gerard van Honthorst, Wybrand de Geest, Pieter de Grebber, Paulus Bor, Christiaen van Couwenbergh, Cornelis Vroom, Artus Quellinus the Elder.The House served as inspiration for theCity Palace of Potsdam built by the son in law of prince Frederick Henry, Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg.Houses completed in the 17th century Gardens in the Netherlands Palaces in the Netherlands Buildings and structures in South Holland Demolished buildings and structures in the Netherlands Baroque architecture in the Netherlands Landscape design history Buildings and structures demolished in 1815", "machine_text": " Huis Honselaarsdijk is a former castle, now it is a stately home and National Heritage Monument in the municipality of Woudrichem, in the province of North Brabant in the Netherlands.

They also compete to ensure that their act wins the competition, thus making them the winning coach. The original panel featured Aryana Sayeed, Qais Ulfat, Nazir Khara, and Obaid Juenda; the panel for the second season features Ulfast, Juenda, Khara, and new coach Fereshta Samah.In early 2015, Tolo TV announced that they had no plans for a third season.Selection process and format Each season begins with the 'Blind Auditions,' where coaches form their team of artists (12) whom they mentor through the remainder of the season. The coaches' chairs are faced towards the audience during artists' performances; those interested in an artist press their button, which turns their chair towards the artist and illuminates the bottom of the chair to read 'I want you.' At the conclusion of the performance, an artist either defaults to the only coach who turned around, or selects his or her coach if more than one coach expresses interest.In the 'Battle Rounds,' each coach pairs two of his or her team members to perform together, then their coach chooses the winner of the battle will advanced to the live shows and the loser will be eliminated.In the final live performance phase of the competition, artists perform in weekly shows, where public voting narrows to a final group of artists and eventually declares a winner. The coaches have the power to save one artist that had not received the public's vote that week. As of season two, these artists would give a last chance performance to win their coach's save. However, in deciding who moves on to the final four phase, the television audience and the coaches have equal say. With one team member remaining for each coach, the contestants compete against each other in the finale, where the outcome is decided solely by public vote.

This project encourages constructive dialogue and diverse perspectives from both sides of the debate. It promotes mutual understanding and an appreciation of the necessity of both personal freedoms and the rule of law. The project was founded in 2018 by two women in the United States: Natalie Williams and Leah Long. They saw that while much public discourse dealt with socio-economic and political issues, there was a lack of open debate and dialogue on themes related to personal freedoms. This led to the creation of Arengo and Freedom. The project focuses on three main ideas: a free space for dialogue, responsible free expression, and democratic action. It encourages people to engage in open and honest conversations, regardless of political boundaries, in order to find common ground, even when there are disagreements. Arengo and Freedom provides a platform for both heated debates and thoughtful exchanges. There are Facilitated Conversations, Debates, and Workshops. Facilitated Conversations focus on generating understanding through respectful dialogue, and Debates provide a platform for a structured argument. Workshops are based on the principles of energy democracy and collaborative democracy, aiming to creating a culture of mutual learning and respect. Arengo and Freedom also works to build collaboration between civil society organizations, governments, and other groups. Currently the project is funded by private donors and it is planning to work with the public sector in order to increase the project’s capacity to reach a wider range of social actors. Arengo and Freedom has been featured in international and domestic publications, including Huffington Post, The Guardian, and Medium. It is seen as a champion of freedom of speech and a platform to challenge conservative culture and power structures. The mission of the project remains to create a vibrant space for meaningful conversations, respectful dialogue, and the expression of diverse ideas. As stated by one of the project’s founders, Leah Long: “The Arengo and Freedom project focuses on creating a positive, inclusive space for free people to have memorable conversations and take action.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Wuppertal Hauptbahnhof\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Wuppertal Hauptbahnhof (German for Wuppertal main station) is a railway station in the city of Wuppertal, just south of the Ruhr Area, in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia.It is on the line between Düsseldorf/Cologne and Dortmund. The 1848 reception building is one of the oldest of its kind. The station was originally Elberfeld station and has been renamed several times since. Since 1992, it has been called Wuppertal Hauptbahnhof. Wuppertal Hauptbahnhof is also the site of lost luggage operations for Deutsche Bahn.HistoryOn 3 September 1841, a few years after the opening of the first railway in Germany, the Dusseldorf-Elberfeld Railway Company (German: Düsseldorf-Elberfelder Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, DEE) began operation of the Düsseldorf–Elberfeld line from its Düsseldorf station to its Elberfeld station (now Wuppertal-Steinbeck station). It was the first steam-worked railway line in Western Germany and Prussia.The Bergisch-Märkische Railway Company (Bergisch-Märkische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, BME), opened its Elberfeld–Dortmund railway from its Elberfeld station (known as Döppersberg station) via Hagen to Dortmund to Schwelm on 9 October 1847. It was extended to Hagen and Dortmund on 20 December 1848. The BME took over the DEE in 1857.The first provisional station building became inadequate within a few years. It was decided to build a new building, designed by Hauptner and Ebeling and opened in 1850 on a new section of line connecting the BME and DEE lines, which was completed on 9 March 1849. Around 1900, a protruding porch was built in front of the ground floor, which conflicted with the architectural design.Nevertheless, this concept was maintained after its reconstruction after World War II.This will only change with the completion of the current renovation of the station/Döppersberg area.The station has been renamed several times. It was first called Elberfeld, but a few years later it was renamed Elberfeld-Döppersberg and before the First World War it was renamed Elberfeld Hauptbahnhof. In the early 1930s the station's name was changed to Wuppertal-Elberfeld station as a consequence of the merger of the towns of Elberfeld and Barmen as the city of Wuppertal. Finally in 1992, it was renamed Wuppertal Hauptbahnhof.Station buildings The station building is located next to platform track 1 and is connected by a tunnel to tracks 2–5. Above the entrance, near the old Reichsbahn railway division of Elberfeld, there are four pillars supporting the roof. The building is connected by the 200-metre-long Döppersberg pedestrian tunnel directly with central Elberfeld and the Wuppertal Hbf (Döppersberg) Schwebebahn (monorail) station.A McDonald's restaurant has been established in the premises of the former baggage check-in and in the tunnel under the entrance there a large newsagency/book shop and a bakery. The low building in front of the historic station building houses a pharmacy. In front of the entrance to the station there is a parking area, including a taxi stand, and nearby there is an Inter City Hotel.Architecture The original building is one of the oldest big city railway stations in Germany. It is a three-storey ashlar building bounded by tower-like corner projections. The main entrance in the middle of the building is a four-columned portico, with emphasised Corinthian capitals and has strong antique ornamentation. The ground floor originally had arched openings and it has six rectangular windows on each level and on each side of the portico. It was necessary in 1900 to build a ground-floor entrance porch to cater for the growing need for space for counters and waiting rooms.The station is part of an ensemble of buildings built in neoclassical style, which is grouped around the railway station forecourt. On the western side of the square is the headquarters of the former Reichsbahn railway division of Elberfeld; on the eastern side there used to be the headquarters of the Chief General Manager, but thus was torn down after the Second World War.The construction of the station was accompanied by extensive urban development in the Döppersberg area. The Döppersberg bridge (Döppersberger Brücke) was built to connect centre of old Elberfeld with the station over the Wupper.Reconstruction since 2014 The entire area around the station has been extensively reconstructed, finishing in 2018. The main goal was to create a continuous pedestrian and shopping area connecting the station to the city centre, as is already the case in many other German cities, such as Cologne, Stuttgart or Hanover. The B 7 which is a very busy arterial road, was relocated to a tunnel, while a pedestrian zone was built above it.Preparations began in the summer of 2009, and the opening ceremony for work on the new, modernised station was held on 30 June 2009. Since the completion of the work in 2018, it has had a two-storey shopping level, a large station forecourt, which was built on the former Bahnhofstrasse, and a bridge and café over the B 7, which was lowered by about seven metres. A new bus station has replaced the bus stops that were previously on the B 7. It was built above a 200-space car park next to the station. Instead of a glass cube—which had previously been planned—a striking building with a bronze-coloured facade was built, which contains a Primark branch.The modernisation of the Deutsche Bahn entrance building at an expected cost of €12.4 million started in 2014. This modernisation was expected to be completed in 2016.In the course of the renovation, bus services were temporarily relocated from the street of Döppersberg to the districts of Ohligsmühle and Wall at the timetable change in July 2014. First Döppersberg was lowered from the end of October 2012 and then the eastern part of the station lobby was demolished from the end of February 2013. The tenancies in this area—pharmacy, pub, bank branch, bakery and fast food restaurant—were terminated in autumn 2012 and they were closed. The DB Travel Center was temporarily located in a shipping container at the western end of platform 1.The B 7 was closed in July 2014 and the superstructure of the Döppersberg bridge was removed in August 2014. The pedestrian tunnel ending there was closed in January 2015. Instead, a steel replacement pedestrian bridge crossed the B-7 construction site. This involved a 300-metre-long walk around the station building. The B 7 was reopened to traffic in July 2017.A computer-based interlocking was put into operation in the Wuppertal area at the end of August 2017. This involved the installation of 387 sets of signals, 98 sets of points and 374 kilometres of cable. In addition, track and overhead line work was pending. The station was completely closed for work during the Easter and summer holidays in 2017. A total of 90 replacement buses were operated.The restoration of the historic entrance building was originally the responsibility of Deutsche Bahn, which wanted to find a private investor to carry out the restoration and subsequent operation by the spring of 2019. Deutsche Bahn also planned to sell some land at the station on which various ancillary buildings now stand to the municipal utility company, which intended to build the valley station of the planned Wuppertal cable car there. However, this project was abandoned after 61.6", "machine_text": " Wuppertal Hauptbahnhof is a railway station located in the city of Wuppertal, in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The station is situated along the Wupper Valley Railway, a line between Wuppertal and Solingen and connects it with the neighbouring cities of Wülfrath, Hilden as well as Velbert, Mettmann and Schwelm. It is the busiest railway station in Wuppertal and one of the busiest in North Rhine-Westphalia. The station was established in 1861 upon the opening of the Wupper Valley Railway and has since been constantly growing and expanding. Wuppertal Hauptbahnhof was significantly renovated and expanded over the course of several decades. Currently, the building of the station and the platform area together cover an area of about 34,800 square metres. The station is a category 3 station and is classified as a Kategorie HBF 6. The station is connected to the S-Bahn line S7 and serves Deutsche Bahn's regional, intercity and international services to all major cities in the country. There are 8 platform tracks and 5 departure tracks at the station, as well as 4 non operating lines which lead to all regional stations in the surrounding area. An underground passage connects the platform area with the station building. The station building is a three-floor building, which serves as an important railway hub and offers several services such as restaurants, stores and service counters. There are several departures daily to other cities in North Rhine-Westphalia as well as several long-distance trains. The station also offers connections to the city's U-Bahn and other public transportation services. Wuppertal Hauptbahnhof is not only a major railway station, but its importance extends to other parts of the local economy, as the hub serves in many ways as a gateway to the city.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Cuban intervention in Angola\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Cuban intervention in Angola (codenamed Operation Carlota) began on 5 November 1975, when Cuba sent combat troops in support of the communist-aligned People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) against the pro-western National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) and National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA). The intervention came after the outbreak of the Angolan Civil War, which occurred after the former Portuguese colony was granted independence after the Angolan War of Independence. The civil war quickly became a proxy war between the Eastern Bloc led by the Soviet Union and the Western Bloc led by the United States. South Africa and the United States backed UNITA and the FNLA, while communist nations backed the MPLA.Some 4,000 Cuban troops helped to turn back a three-pronged advance by the SADF, UNITA, FLNA, and Zairean troops. Later, 18,000 Cuban troops defeated the FNLA in the north and UNITA in the south. Separatists from the Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (FLEC) fought the Cubans but were defeated. In 1976, the Cuban military in Angola reached 36,000 troops. Following the withdrawal of Zaire and South Africa (March 1976), Cuban forces remained in Angola to support the MPLA government against UNITA in the continuing civil war. South Africa spent the following decade launching bombing and strafing raids from its bases in South West Africa into southern Angola, while UNITA engaged in ambushes, hit-and-run attacks, and harassment of Cuban units.In 1988, Cuban troops (increased to about 55,000) intervened again to avert military disaster in a Soviet-led People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola (FAPLA) offensive against UNITA, which was still supported by South Africa, leading to the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale and the opening of a second front. This turn of events is considered to have been the major impetus to the success of the ongoing peace talks leading to the New York Accords, the agreement by which Cuban and South African forces withdrew from Angola while South West Africa gained its independence from South Africa. Cuban military engagement in Angola ended in 1991, while the Angolan Civil War continued until 2002. Cuban casualties in Angola totaled approximately 10,000 dead, wounded or missing.BackgroundFailure of the Alvor Agreement and Civil WarThe Carnation Revolution of 25 April 1974 in Portugal took the world by surprise and caught the independence movements in its last African colonies unprepared. After smooth negotiations, Mozambique's independence was granted on 25 June 1975, but Angolan control remained disputed between the three rival independence movements: MPLA, FNLA and UNITA in Angola-proper and Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (FLEC) in Cabinda.Until independence, the independence movements' priority lay in fighting the colonial power and they initially had no clear alliances. With the disappearance of Portugal as their common foe, ethnic and ideological rivalries moved to the fore. Fighting between the three already broke out in November 1974, starting in Luanda and quickly spreading across all of Angola. The new leftist Portuguese government showed little interest in interfering but often favored the MPLA. The country soon fell apart into different spheres of influence, the FNLA taking hold of northern Angola and UNITA in the central south. The MPLA mostly held the coastline, the far south-east and, in November 1974 gained control of Cabinda. The disunity of the three main movements postponed the handing over of power. The Alvor Agreement, which the three and Portugal signed on 15 January, proved to be no solid foundation for the procedure. The transitional government the agreement provided for was equally composed of the three big independence movements and Portugal. It was sworn in on 31 January 1975; independence day was set for 11 November 1975, the same day of the ceasefire. FLEC was not part of the deal because it fought for the independence of Cabinda, which the Portuguese had administratively joined as an exclave to Angola.Fighting in Luanda (referred to as the 'Second War of Liberation' by the MPLA) resumed hardly a day after the transitional government took office, when Agostinho Neto took advantage of the ceasefire to launch a purge of his rival Daniel Chipenda's supporters within the MPLA. The Chipenda faction was largely annihilated, leaving the FLNA as the only remaining obstacle to MPLA control of the city. Chipenda and 2,000 of his surviving troops defected to FLNA around February, which further heightened tensions. FNLA troops, flown in from Zaire, had been taking positions in Luanda since October 1974. The MPLA had followed later in smaller numbers. To that point, the MPLA and UNITA 'had given every sign of intending to honour the Alvor agreement', however fighting broke out in Luanda between the FNLA and the MPLA. The FNLA were backed by Mobutu, the U.S., and China. By March, the FNLA from northern Angola was driving on Luanda joined by units of the Zairian army which the U.S. had encouraged Mobutu to provide. On 28 April, the FNLA unleashed a second wave of attacks and in early May, 200 Zairian troops crossed into northern Angola in its support. Neto requested the Soviets increase its military aid to the MPLA. During March 1975, Soviet pilots flew thirty planeloads of weapons into Brazzaville, where they were then transported to Luanda. The Soviet Union airlifted thirty million dollars' worth of weaponry to the MPLA in three months, while Cuba deployed a contingent of 230 military advisers and technicians to the MPLA, with the first advisers arriving in May.The fighting intensified with street clashes in April and May, and UNITA became involved after over two hundred of its members were massacred by an MPLA contingent in June. The initially weaker MPLA retreated south but with supplies finally arriving from the Soviet Union then succeeded in driving the FNLA out of Luanda by 9 July, and UNITA voluntarily withdrew to its stronghold in the south. The FNLA took up positions east of Kifangondo at the eastern outskirts of the capital, from where it kept up its pressure, and eliminated all remaining MPLA presence in the northern provinces of Uige and Zaire. The fighting was taken up throughout the whole country. The independence movements attempted to seize key strategic points, most importantly the capital on the day of independence. By August, the MPLA had control of 11 of the 15 provincial capitals, including Cabinda and Luanda. The fighting was taken up throughout the whole country. The independence movements attempted to seize key strategic points, most importantly the capital on the day of independence.Foreign involvement Starting in the early 1960s, the three big independence movements enjoyed support from a wide range of countries, in some cases even from the same. By the time of independence, FNLA and UNITA received aid from the U.S., Zaire, South Africa and China.As long as Portugal was present in Angola, the movements had to have their headquarters in independent neighbouring countries, making Congo-Léopoldville (Zaire/Democratic Republic of the Congo, formerly Belgian), for both MPLA and FNLA a logical choice. After its expulsion from Léopoldville (now Kinshasa) in November 1963, the MPLA moved across the Congo River to formerly French Congo-Brazzaville (Republic of Congo), where it was invited by its new leftist government. The FNLA stayed in Congo-Léopoldville to which it remained closely tied and from where it received the bulk of its support. FNLA leader Holden Roberto was linked to Mobutu by marriage and obligated to him for many past favours. Over the years the FNLA had become little more than an extension of Mobutu's own armed forces. Much of Zaire's support came indirectly from the U.S., with which Zaire's leader Mobutu had close ties. Zaire was the first country to send troops to Angola in March 1975 and to engage in fighting against the MPLA by the summer of that year.In the summer of 1974, China was first to act after the Portuguese Revolution and posted 200 military instructors to Zaire where they trained FNLA troops and supplied military assistance. Chinese involvement was a measure against Soviet influence rather than that from western countries. On 27 October 1975, they were also the first to withdraw their military instructors. UNITA, which split away from FNLA in 1965/66 was initially Maoist and received some support from China. China had been training Mobutu's elite division, the Kamanyola, also trained the FNLA but withdrew their support for Zaire and the FNLA by the end of December 1975. In 1975 China were also the first to pull out of the area after the Portuguese Revolution. When their support ceased FNLA and UNITA became firmly established in the western camp.The United States had a history of supporting the Salazar regime in Portugal. They allowed NATO equipment to be used in Angola during the Independence War. U.S. support for the FNLA was taken up by the Kennedy administration in 1960. Holden Roberto had been on the Central Intelligence Agency's (CIA) payroll since 1963. On 7 July 1974, the CIA started funding the FNLA on a small scale. On 22 January 1975, one week after the Alvor Accords were signed and just before the provisional government of Angola was to take office, the U.S. National Security Council's '40 Committee', which oversaw clandestine CIA operations, authorized US 300,000 in covert aid to the FNLA.As the CIA was suspicious of the left-leaning MPLA, it 'had no wish to see the US government deal with the MPLA' and it did not want them to be part of the transitional government. The US increased its support for the FNLA and for the first time took up funding of UNITA. On 18 July 1975, U.S. president Ford approved covert CIA operation 'IAFEATURE' to aid FNLA and UNITA with money (US30 million), arms and instructors. U.S. military instructors (CIA) arrived in southern Angola in early August, where they closely cooperated with their South African counterparts who arrived around the same time. The support involved the recruitment of mercenaries and an expanded propaganda campaign against the MPLA. Author Wayne Smith states that the U.S. 'was publicly committed to an embargo against the delivery of arms to Angolan factions while it was secretly launching a paramilitary programme'.South Africa, which was then under a white-minority rule known as Apartheid, soon came to be the closest allies of both UNITA and FNLA. Other western countries with their own clandestine support for FNLA and UNITA were Great Britain and France. Israel supported the FNLA from 1963 to 1969 and the FNLA sent members to Israel for training. Through the 1970s Israel shipped arms to the FNLA via Zaire.Some East Bloc countries and Yugoslavia first established ties with the MPLA in the early 1960s during its struggle against the Portuguese. The Soviet Union started modest military aid in the late 1960s. This support remained clandestine, came in trickles and sometimes ceased altogether. This was the case in 1972, when the MPLA came under strong pressure from the Portuguese and was torn apart by internal strife (struggle between MPLA leader António Agostinho Neto and Chipenda from 1972 to 1974). Soviet aid was suspended in 1973 with the exception of a few limited shipments in 1974 to counter Chinese support for the FNLA; only Yugoslavia continued to send supplies to the MPLA. In response to U.S. and Chinese support for the FNLA, Soviet support for the MPLA massively increased in March 1975 in the form of arms deliveries by air via Brazzaville and by sea via Dar-es-Salaam. Soviet assistance to the MPLA was always somewhat reluctant; they never fully trusted Neto and their relationship was to remain ambivalent through the following years. The Soviets preferred a political solution, but they did not want to see the MPLA marginalized. Even after the South African incursions the Soviets only sent arms, but no instructors for the use of the sophisticated weapons. Among the other Eastern Bloc countries the MPLA had well established contacts with East Germany and Romania, the former shipping large amounts of non-military supplies. Although being leftist, Neto was interested in an ideological balance in his foreign support, but in spite of 'overtures' well into 1975, he was unable to procure support for the MPLA from the U.S., thus becoming solely dependent on the eastern camp.Cuba and the MPLA before the Civil War Cuba's first informal contacts with the MPLA dated back to the late 1950s. MPLA guerrillas received their first training from Cubans in Algiers starting in 1963 and Che Guevara met MPLA-leader Agostinho Neto for the first high-level talks on 5 January 1965 in Brazzaville where Cuba was establishing a two-year military mission. This mission had the primary purpose to act as a strategic reserve for the Cuban operation in eastern Congo. It also was to provide assistance to the Alphonse Massemba-Débat government in Brazzaville and, at Neto's request, to the MPLA with its operations against the Portuguese in Cabinda and in northern Angola where its major foe was the FNLA. This co-operation marked the beginning of the Cuban-MPLA alliance which was to last 26 years.The MPLA-Cuban operations in Cabinda and northern Angola were met with very little success and the Cubans ended the mission to Brazzaville as planned in July 1966. The MPLA moved its headquarters to Lusaka in early 1968. A few MPLA guerrillas continued to receive military training in Cuba but else contacts between Cuba and the MPLA cooled as Havana turned its attention to the independence struggle in Guinea-Bissau. Following Castro's tour of African countries in May 1972 Cuba stepped up its internationalist operations in Africa starting a training mission in Sierra Leone and smaller technical missions in Equatorial Guinea, Somalia, Algeria and Tanzania.In a memorandum of 22 November 1972, the Cuban Major Manuel Piñeiro Lozada communicated to Raúl Castro the MPLA's request for small amounts of training and crew. These considerations in 1972 bore no fruit and Cuba's attentions remained focused on Guinea-Bissau. It was only after the Portuguese Revolution that an MPLA delegation brought a request for economic aid, military training and arms to Cuba on 26 July 1974. In early October Cuba received another request, this time more urgent, for five Cuban military officers to help organize the MPLA army, FAPLA. In December 1974 and January 1975, Cuba sent Major Alfonso Perez Morales and Carlos Cadelo on a fact finding mission to Angola to assess the situation. In a letter of 26 January 1975, handed to Cadelo and Morales, Neto listed what the MPLA wanted from Cuba, including 'The establishment, organization, and maintenance of a military school for cadres', 'A [Cuban] ship to transport the war materiel that we have in Dar-es-Salaam to Angola', 'Uniforms and military equipment for 10,000 men', and 'Financial assistance while we are establishing and organizing ourselves.'Although Cuba was considering the establishment of a military mission (military training) in Angola, again there was no official response to this request. It was only reiterated by the MPLA in May 1975 when Cuban commander Flavio Bravo met Neto in Brazzaville while the Portuguese were preparing to withdraw from their African colonies. The MPLA's hopes for aid were turned to the eastern Bloc countries from where not enough help materialised according to their wishes. Neto is quoted in a Cuban report complaining about Moscow's lacklustre support. He also expressed hope that the war in Angola would become 'a vital issue in the fight against imperialism and socialism'. But neither the Soviets nor the MPLA itself expected a major war to break out before independence. In March 1975 the MPLA sent of its 100 members for training in the Soviet Union and the requested financial assistance from Yugoslavia, who gave 100,000 dollars.South Africa intervenesPortugal's sudden retreat from Angola and Mozambique in 1975 ended a history of South African military and intelligence cooperation with Portugal against the Angolan and Namibian independence movements dating back to the 1960s, later formalized in a secret alliance codenamed Alcora Exercise. It also ended economic cooperation with regard to the Cunene hydro-project at the Angolan-Namibian border, which South Africa had financed.South African involvement in Angola, subsumed under what it called the South African Border War, started in 1966 when the conflict with the Namibian independence movement, South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), which at that time had its bases in Ovamboland and Zambia, first flared up. With the loss of the Portuguese as an ally and the establishment of pro-SWAPO communist rule in the two former colonies, the apartheid regime lost highly valued sections of its 'cordon sanitaire' (buffer zone) between itself and hostile black Africa. In the following years South Africa engaged in numerous military and economic activities in the region, backing RENAMO in the Mozambican Civil War, undertaking various measures at economic destabilization against Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, backing an unsuccessful mercenary intervention in the Seychelles in 1981, and supporting a coup in Lesotho in 1986. It was behind a coup attempt in Tanzania in 1983, provided support for rebels in Zimbabwe since independence, carried out raids against African National Congress offices in Maputo, Harare and Gaborone and conducted a counterinsurgency war in Namibia against SWAPO. SWAPO retreated to and operated from bases in Angola, and South Africa was confronted not only with the issue of having to cross another border in pursuit of SWAPO but also of another leftist government in the region. Unlike the other countries in the region, South Africa had no economic leverage on Angola, thus making military action the only possible means to exert any influence on the course of events.On 14 July 1975, South African Prime Minister John Vorster approved weapons worth US 14 million to be bought secretly for FNLA and UNITA. First arms shipments for FNLA and UNITA from South Africa arrived in August 1975.On 9 August 1975, a 30-man patrol of the South African Defence Force (SADF) moved some 50 km into southern Angola and occupied the Ruacana-Calueque hydro-electric complex and other installations on the Cunene River. Several hostile incidences with UNITA and SWAPO frightening foreign worker had been the pretext. The defence of the Calueque dam complex in southern Angola was South Africa's justification for the first permanent deployment of regular SADF units inside Angola.On 22 August 1975, the SADF launched operation 'Sausage II', a major raid against SWAPO in southern Angola. In addition, on 4 September 1975, Vorster authorized the provision of limited military training, advice and logistical support. In turn FNLA and UNITA would help the South Africans fighting SWAPO.Due to the recent MPLA's successes, UNITA's territory had been shrinking to parts of central Angola, and it became clear to South Africa that independence day would find the MPLA in control of Luanda; 'neither the United States nor South Africa were willing to accept that.' The SADF set up a training camp near Silva Porto and prepared the defences of Nova Lisboa (Huambo). They assembled the mobile attack unit 'Foxbat' to stop approaching FAPLA-units with which it clashed on 5 October, thus saving Nova Lisboa for UNITA.On 14 October, the South Africans secretly launched Operation Savannah when Task Force Zulu, the first of several South African columns, crossed from Namibia into Cuando Cubango. Southern Angola was in chaos with the three independence movements fighting each other for dominance. It took FAPLA some time, before it noticed who else it was up against and the SADF advanced very quickly. Task force Foxbat joined the intervention in mid-October. The operation provided for elimination of the MPLA from the southern border area, then from south western Angola, from the central region, and finally for the capture of Luanda.According author to Edward George, the South African government 'believed that by invading Angola it could install its proxies and shore up apartheid for the foreseeable future'. The United States had known of South Africa's military plans in advance. They encouraged the South Africans and co-operated with them, contrary to Secretary of State Henry Kissinger's testimony to Congress at the time, and in contrast to what President Ford told the Chinese, who supported the FNLA but were worried about South African engagement in Angola. According to John Stockwell, a former CIA officer, 'there was close liaison between the CIA and the South Africans'and ''high officials' in Pretoria claimed that their intervention in Angola had been based on an 'understanding' with the United States'.Cuban military mission On 3 August, a Cuban delegation traveled a second time to Angola to assess the situation, to draw up plans for the training programme as requested by Neto, and to hand over US100,000. Neto had complained 'of the little amount of aid from socialist countries and 'that the USSR detained aid to the MPLA in 1972, even though they told us that they are now helping with arms, but it's very little compared with their vast needs'. Arguelles agreed with Neto as he saw the sides in Angola 'clearly defined, that the FNLA and UNITA represented the international imperialist forces and the Portuguese reaction, and the MPLA represented the progressive and nationalist forces.'After the return of the delegation on 8 August, the Cubans considered the options of their instructors in Angola in case of an intervention by South Africa or Zaire which would be either 'guerrilla war' or withdrawal to Zambia, where Cuba proceeded to open an embassy. In a memorandum of 11 August 1975, Major Raúl Diaz Argüelles to Major Raúl Castro explained the reasons for the visit and briefed on the contents of the talks. He underlined that the attacks on the part of the FNLA and of Mobutu to the MPLA and the possible development of future actions until independence in the month of November was taken into account and the awareness that 'the reactionaries and the imperialists would try all possible methods to avoid having the forces of the MPLA take power'. The same day Argüelles proposed a 94-man mission to Castro. On 15 August, Castro urged the USSR to increase support for the MPLA, offered to send special troops and asked for assistance. The Russians declined.In view of the Zairian intervention in the north and the South African occupation of Ruacana-Calueque hydro-electric complex in the south, it was decided to staff the CIRs with almost 500 Cubans instead of the requested 100, which were to form about 4,800 FAPLA recruits into 16 infantry battalions, 25 mortar batteries and various anti-aircraft units in three to six months. These 500 men included 17 in a medical brigade and 284 officers. 'The decision to expand the operation reflected a feeling in Havana that … there had to be enough of them to fulfil their mission as well as defend themselves in the event the operation went awry. It was nevertheless clear that …they expected it (the mission) to be short term and to last around 6 months'.The dispatch of the Cuban volunteers started 21 August and an advance party with the most urgently needed specialists used international commercial flights. Small groups continued to trickle into Luanda on such flights as well as on Cuba's aging Britannia planes and the bulk arrived after a two-week trip aboard three Cuban cargo vessels; the first one, the 'Vietnam Heroico' docked at Porto Amboim on 5 October. The arrival of two Cuban ships in Angola with instructors on board was reported by the CIA and raised no alarm in Washington.The CIRs were placed in Cabinda, Benguela, Saurimo (formerly Henrique de Carvalho) and at N'Dalatando (formerly Salazar). The CIR in Cabinda accounted for almost half of the total, 191 men, while the others had 66 or 67 each. Some were posted in headquarters in Luanda or in other places throughout the country. The reason for the stronger detachment in Cabinda was the perceived threat from Zaire either to Cabinda or to the Congo. By the time the training centres were fully staffed and operational on 18–20 October, unnoticed by the world, Operation Savannah was already in full swing.In contrast to the successes in the south, where by mid October the MPLA had gained control of 12 of Angola's provinces and most urban centres, they only barely managed to keep the well equipped FNLA and its allies abreast on the northern front just east of Luanda. The FNLA was receiving arms and equipment from the U.S. via Zaire starting in the end of Julyand had been strengthened in September by the arrival of the Fourth and Seventh Zairian Commando Battalions. From July to November the front moved back and forth between Caxito and Quifangondo (Kifangondo). Neto asked the Soviet Union for more support which had no intention to send any staff before independence and only reluctantly sent more arms. The Cubans were busy dealing with the arrival of the contingents for the CIRs and it was only on 19 October that they paid sufficient attention to Luanda's precarious position. Realizing the threat they shut down the CIR at Salazar only 3 days after it started operating and deployed most of the recruits and Cuban instructors in Luanda. Forty instructors from the CIR Salazar were the first Cubans to become involved in the defence of Quifangondo on 23 October 1975 when they launched an unsuccessful assault one FNLA-Zairian forces at Morro do Cal. A second group supported the MPLA on 28 October along the same defence line to the east of Kifangondo.Yet unnoticed by the Cubans, the territory the MPLA had just gained in the south was quickly lost to the South African advances. After South African advisors and antitank weapons had helped to stop an MPLA advance on Nova Lisboa (Huambo) in early October, Zulu took Roçadas by 20 October, Sá da Bandeira by 24 October and Moçâmedes by 28 October.On 2–3 November, Cuban instructors for the third time got involved in the fighting, this time 51 men from the CIR Benguela, when they unsuccessfully tried to help the FAPLA stop the Zulu advance near Catengue. This first encounter between Cubans and South Africans also led to the first officially recognized Cuban fatalities. 'Their participation led Zulu-Commander Breytenbach to conclude that his troops were 'facing the best organized and heaviest FAPLA opposition to date''.Cuba's first interventionOperation Carlota It was only after the MPLA debacle at Catengue that the Cubans became fully aware of the South African intervention, that Luanda would be taken and that their training missions were in grave danger unless they took immediate action. Neto had requested immediate and massive reinforcements from Havana at the urging of Argüelles. On 4 November Castro decided to launch an intervention on an unprecedented scale, codenaming the mission Operation Carlota, after 'Black Carlota', the leader of a slave rebellion in 1843. The same day, a first plane with 100 heavy weapon specialists, which the MPLA had requested in September, left for Brazzaville, arriving in Luanda on 7 November. On 9 November the first two Cuban planes arrived in Luanda with the first 100 men of a contingent of a 652-strong battalion of elite Special Forces. The first priority of the Cubans was helping the MPLA to keep hold of Luanda. Fidel Castro explained the Cuban intervention: 'When the invasion of Angola by regular South African troops started 23 October, we could not sit idle. And when the MPLA asked us for help, we offered the necessary aid to prevent Apartheid from making itself comfortable in Angola'.With Operation Carlota, Cuba became a major player in the conflict. Unlike its foreign engagements in the sixties this was no secret operation. Castro decided to support the MPLA in all openness, sending special forces and 35,000 infantry by the end of 1976, deploying them at Cuba's own expense and with its own means from November 1975 to January 1976. As on its previous missions, all personnel were volunteers and the call-up was extremely popular.Air transportation for quick deployments proved to be a major problem. Cuba only had three ageing medium-range Bristol Britannia turboprop planes not fit to make 9,000 km non-stop transatlantic crossings. Nevertheless, between 7 November and 9 December the Cubans managed to run 70 reinforcement flights to Luanda. Initially they were able to make stops in Barbados, the Azores, or Newfoundland, prompting pressure from Washington to deny Cuba landing rights. But moving take-offs to Cuba's easternmost airport, Holguin, taking as little weight as necessary, and adding additional tanks, the planes were used for numerous runs across the ocean until the Soviets pitched in with long-distance jet planes.For the bulk of the troops and the equipment the Cubans commandeered all available ships in its merchant marine, the first three sailing from Havana on 8 November. They docked in Luanda on 27 and 29 November and 1 December bringing 1,253 troops and equipment.The deployment of troops was not pre-arranged with the USSR, as often reported and depicted by the US-administration. On the contrary, it also took the USSR by surprise. The Soviets were forced to accept the Cuban troop deployment so as not to endanger relations with their most important ally in close proximity to the United States. But they had in mind to keep a lid on the extent of the Cuban engagement and merely sent arms and a few specialists to Brazzaville and Dar-es-Salaam. It was only two months later after the fighting swung in favour of the Cubans and the U.S. passed the Clark Amendment that Moscow agreed to a degree of support by arranging for a maximum of 10 transport flights from Cuba to Angola.With the FNLA attacking from the east the situation for the MPLA only a few days before independence looked dim. In addition to this, Cabinda was under threat of takeover by a FLEC-Zairian force. The Cuban troops able to intervene before the declaration of independence on 11 November were basically the ones posted in the three CIRs, the 100 specialists that arrived in Luanda on 7 November and the first 164 special forces of Operation Carlota arriving on two planes on the evening of 8 November. The 100 specialists and 88 men of the special forces were immediately dispatched to the nearby front at Quifangondo where the FNLA-Zairian force had launched an assault that very morning. They supported 850 FAPLA, 200 Katangans and one Soviet advisor. First heavy weapons had already arrived from Cuba by ship on 7 November, among them cannons, mortars and 6 BM-21 (Katyusha) multiple rocket launchers. The Cubans received reports that the expected invasion of Cabinda had started on the morning of 8 November.Northern front and Cabinda The invasion of Cabinda was conducted by three FLEC and one Zairian infantry battalions under the command of 150 French and American mercenaries. The MPLA's had the 232 Cubans of the CIR, a freshly trained and an untrained FAPLA infantry battalion at its disposal. In the ensuing battle for Cabinda from 8–13 November they managed to repel the invasion without support from Operation Carlota, thus saving the exclave for the MPLA.Two days before independence the most imminent danger for the MPLA came from the northern front where the FNLA and its allies stood east of Quifangondo. 2,000 FNLA troops were supported by two battalions of Zairian infantry troops (1,200 men), 120 Portuguese mercenaries, a few resident advisors, among them a small CIA contingent, and 52 South Africans led by General Ben de Wet Roos. They were manning the artillery provided by the SADF which had been flown into Ambriz only two days before.After artillery bombardment on Luanda and Quifangondo through the night and a bombing raid by the South African air force in the early hours the final attack of the FNLA was launched on the morning of 10 November. The attacking force was ambushed and destroyed by the FAPLA-Cuban forces. Cuban forces also bombarded their South African and FNLA enemies with BM-21 Grad rocket launchers which had been put into place only the night before, and were well out of range of the antiquated South African guns. The defeat of the FNLA in the Battle of Quifangondo secured the capital for the MPLA. On the same day the Portuguese handed over power 'to the people of Angola' and shortly after midnight Neto proclaimed independence and the formation of the 'People's Republic of Angola'. Urged by the CIA and other clandestine foreign services, the FNLA and UNITA announced the proclamation of a Democratic People's Republic with the temporary capital at Huambo. Yet, UNITA and FNLA could not agree on a united government and fighting between them already broke out in Huambo on the eve of independence day. On the day of independence the MPLA held little more than the capital and a strip of central Angola inland toward Zaire and the exclave of Cabinda. On 4 December the FAPLA-Cubans launched a counter-offensive against the FNLA. But with Luanda and Cabinda secured and the defeat of the FNLA at Quifangondo they could finally turn more attention to the south.Cuba operated independently through December and January bringing in their troops in slowly, but steadily. Two months after the start of Operation Carlota the Soviets agreed to ten charter flights on long-range IL-62 jet airliners, starting on 8 January. This was followed one week later by an agreement that 'the Soviets would supply all future weaponry … transporting it directly to Angola so that the Cuban airlift could concentrate on personnel.'By early February, with increasing numbers in Cuban troops and sophisticated weaponry, the tide changed in favour of the MPLA. The final offensive in the North started on 1 January 1976. By 3 January FAPLA-Cuban forces took the FNLA air bases of Negage and Camabatela and a day later the FNLA capital of Carmona. A last-ditch attempt by FNLA to use foreign mercenaries enlisted by the CIA (see next chapter: U.S. response) failed; on 11 January FAPLA-Cubans captured Ambriz and Ambrizete (N'zeto) an on 15 February the FNLA's last foothold, São Salvador. By late February one Cuban and 12 FAPLA and battalions had completely annihilated the FNLA, driving what was left of them and the Zairian army across the border. The South African contingent on the northern front had already been evacuated by ship on 28 November. The last mercenaries left northern Angola by 17 January.U.S. response It was several days before the U.S. realised the severity of the FNLA defeat at Quifangondo, but even then had little idea of the extent of the Cuban involvement. The news from the southern front was, in their view, still positive. Kissinger, like the South Africans, was shaken by the scale of the Soviet and Cuban response. The CIA's Angolan task force at CIA headquarters at Langley had been so confident of success by the Zairian and South African regulars, that on 11 November the members had celebrated Angolan independence with wine and cheese in their offices. The U.S. had not commented on the South African intervention in Angola but denounced the Cuban intervention when it first acknowledged Cuban troops in Angola in an official statement on 24 November 1975. Kissinger said 'that US efforts at rapprochement with Cuba would end should 'Cuban armed intervention in the affairs of other nations struggling to decide their own fate' continue.' On 28 February 1976, Ford called Castro 'an international outlaw' and the Cuban intervention a 'flagrant act of aggression'.Due to the hostility between the U.S. and Cuba, the Americans regarded such an air by the Cubans as a defeat which could not be accepted. The U.S. assumed that the USSR was behind the Cuban interference. On 9 December Ford asked the Soviets to suspend the airlift, still assuming it was a Soviet-run operation. The Americans also depicted the motivations and timings of the Cubans differently: They claimed that South Africa had to intervene after Cuba sent troops in support of the MPLA and that the war in Angola was a major new challenge to US power by an expansionist Moscow newly confident following communist victories in the Vietnam War. Only years later did it become clear to them that the Cubans acted on their own behalf.Castro responded to the U.S. reaction: 'Why were they vexed? Why had they planned everything to take possession of Angola before 11 November? Angola is a country rich in resources. In Cabinda there is lots of oil. Some imperialists wonder why we help the Angolans, which interests we have. They are used to thinking that one country helps another one only when it wants its oil, copper, diamonds or other resources. No, we are not after material interests and it is logical that this is not understood by the imperialist. They only know chauvinistic, nationalistic and selfish criteria. By helping the people of Angola we are fulfilling a fundamental duty of Internationalism.On 3 December 1975, in a meeting with officials from the U.S. and China including Deng Xiaoping (Vice Premier and deputy of Mao Zedong), Qiao Guanhua (Foreign Minister), President Gerald Ford, Henry Kissinger (Secretary of State/Foreign Minister), Brent Scowcroft (Assistant to the President for NSA) and George H. W. Bush (Chief of U.S. Liaison Office in Peking) international issues were discussed, one of them being Angola. Although China had supported the MPLA in the past, they now sided with the FNLA and UNITA. China was especially concerned about African sensitivities and pride and considered South African involvement as the primary and relative complex problem. Kissinger responded, that the U.S. is prepared to 'push out South Africa as soon as an alternative military force can be created'. It is in this meeting that President Ford told the Chinese: 'We had nothing to do with the South African involvement, and we will take action to get South Africa out, provided a balance can be maintained for their not being in'. He also said that he had approved US35 million more (in support of the north) above what had been done before. They discussed and agreed who should support the FNLA or UNITA by which means and in what manner taking into account the sensitivities of the neighbouring countries.It was only when the U.S. administration asked Congress for US28 million for IAFEATURE that Congress really paid attention to the events in Angola. By then 'the evidence of the South African invasion was overwhelming and the stench of US-collusion with Pretoria hung in the air. Worse, the growing numbers of Cuban troops had derailed the CIA's plans and the administration seemed at a loss what to do next.' The money was not approved and on 20 December 1975, the U.S. Senate passed an amendment banning covert assistance to anti-Communist forces and curtailing CIA involvement in Angola. Later that winter, an amendment to the foreign aid bill sponsored by Dick Clark extended the ban. (Clark Amendment) The U.S. administration resorted to other means of support for FNLA and UNITA of which one was raising mercenaries. The CIA initiated a covert programme to recruit recruit Brazilians and Europeans to fight in the north of Angola. Altogether they managed to enlist around 250 men, but by the time meaningful numbers arrived in January 1975 the campaign in the north was all but over. Other ways of continued support for the FNLA and UNITA were through South Africa and other U.S. allied states such as Israel and Morocco.A report by Henry Kissinger of 13 January 1976 gives an insight into the activities and hostilities in Angola, inter alia:'US intelligence estimated that by December 20 there were 5,000 to 6,000 Cubans in Angola.' 'Cuban sources, however, indicate that the number hovered around 3,500 to 4,000.' This more or less would have put the Cubans at par with the South Africans on the southern front. Gabriel García Márquez wrote that Kissinger remarked to Venezuelan President Carlos Andrés Pérez: 'Our intelligence services have grown so bad that we only found out that Cubans were being sent to Angola after they were already there.' At that moment, there were many Cuban troops, military specialists and civilian technicians in Angola — more even than Kissinger imagined. Indeed, there were so many ships anchored in the bay of Luanda that by February 1976 Neto said to a functionary close to him: 'It's not right', if they go on like that, the Cubans will ruin themselves.' It is unlikely that even the Cubans had foreseen that their intervention would reach such proportions. It had been clear to them right from the start, however, that the action had to be swift, decisive, and at all costs successful. But one result of the events in Angola in 1976 was the American's heightened attention to African affairs, especially in the south of the continent. Kissinger worried, 'if the Cubans are involved there, Namibia is next and after that South Africa itself.' With the need to distance themselves from outcasts in the eyes of black Africa this also meant the U.S. would drop support for the white regime in Rhodesia, a price it was willing to pay to 'thwart communism'.International press coverage The South Africans had managed to keep their intervention hidden from world view for quite some time. It even took the MPLA until 23 October 1975 to notice that not white mercenaries but the SADF was advancing on Luanda. Yet it took another whole month for the world press to take notice: A day after the South African coastal advance was stopped, two correspondents from Reuters and British Independent Television News published news that South Africans were fighting in Angola. On 23 November 1975 a major Western newspaper, the Washington Post, announced that regular South African troops were fighting inside Angola. Although other papers were still slow to follow, e.g., the New York Times on 12 December, the fact eventually became internationally known. The South African public had also been kept in the dark, and only on 19 December learned more about what was called the 'Border War' when papers published pictures of SADF soldiers captured by FAPLA and the Cubans.Southern frontSADF advance is stoppedBy the time FAPLA and the Cubans were able to turn more attention to the southern front after the battle of Quifangondo, the South Africans had gained considerable ground. On 6 and 7 November 1975, Task Force Zulu took the harbour cities of Benguela and Lobito which had been unexpectedly abandoned. The towns and cities taken by the SADF were handed over to UNITA. In central Angola, at the same time, combat unit Foxbat had moved 800 km north toward Luanda. By then it became clear that Luanda could not be taken by independence day on 11 November and the South Africans considered to break off the advance and retreat. But on 10 November 1975 Vorster gave in to UNITA's urgent request to keep up the military pressure with the aim of capturing as much territory as possible before the upcoming meeting of the OAU. Thus, Zulu and Foxbat continued north with two new battle groups formed further inland (X-Ray and Orange) and 'there was little reason to think the FAPLA would be able to stop this expanded force from capturing Luanda within a week.'Through November and December 1975, the SADF presence in Angola numbered 2,900 to 3,000 personnel.Zulu now faced stronger resistance advancing on Novo Redondo after which fortunes changed in favour of the FAPLA and the Cubans. The first Cuban reinforcements arrived in Porto Amboim, only a few km north of Novo Redondo, quickly destroying three bridges crossing the Queve river, effectively stopping the South African advance along the coast on 13 November 1975. Despite concerted efforts to advance north to Novo Redondo, the SADF was unable to break through FAPLA defences. In a last successful advance a South African task force and UNITA troops took Luso on the Benguela railway on 11 December which they held until 27 December.By mid-December, South Africa extended military service and called in reserves. 'An indication of the seriousness of the situation …. is that one of the most extensive military call-ups in South African history is now taking place'. By late December, Cuba had deployed 3,500 to 4,000 troops in Angola, of which 1,000 were securing Cabindaand eventually the tide turned in favour of the MPLA. Apart from being 'bogged down' on the southern front, South Africa had to deal with two other major setbacks: the international press taking note of the operation and the shift in U.S. policies.South Africa withdraws In light of these developments, Pretoria had to decide whether it would stay in the game and bring in more troops. In late December 1975, there were heated debates between Vorster, foreign minister Muller, defence minister Botha, head of BOSS (South African Bureau of State Security) van den Bergh and a number of senior officials as to withdraw or to stay. Zaire, UNITA and the U.S. urged South Africa to stay. But the U.S. would not openly endorse the South African intervention and assure continuing military assistance in case of an escalation.On 30 December 1975, Vorster planned to withdraw after the OAU emergency session in Addis Ababa on 13 January 1976 to a line 50 to 80 km north of the Namibian border. 'In military terms the advance had come to a halt anyway, as all attempts by Battle-Groups Orange and X-Ray to extend the war into the interior had been forced to turn back by destroyed bridges.'In early January 1976, the Cubans launched a first counter-offensive driving Foxbat from the Tongo and Medunda hills. The OAU meeting which the South Africans had hopes for finally debated the Angola issue and voted on 23 January 1976, condemning the South African intervention and demanding its withdrawal. Sobered by the Cubans' performance and by the West's cold shoulder, Pretoria chose to fold and ordered the retreat of its troops from Angola.The sentiment of the Pretoria government at the time was expressed in a speech by Botha before South African parliament on 17 April 1978, in which he charged the U.S. with 'defaulting on a promise to give them all necessary support in their campaign to defeat the MPLA': 'Against which neighbouring states have we taken aggressive steps? I know of only one occasion in recent years, when we crossed a border and that was in the case of Angola when we did so with the approval and knowledge of the Americans. But they left us in the lurch. We are going to retell that story: the story must be told and how we, with their knowledge, went in there and operated in Angola with their knowledge, how they encouraged us to act and, when we had nearly reached the climax, we were ruthlessly left in the lurch'.Once the decision was made, South Africa rapidly withdrew its forces towards Namibia. In late January, the SADF abandoned the towns of Cela and Novo RedondoApart from a few skirmishes, the Cubans stayed well behind the retreating South Africans and easily overcame the remaining UNITA resistance. By early February 1976, the SADF had retreated to the far south of Angola, leaving behind mine fields and blown up bridges. UNITA's capital, Nova Lisboa (Huambo) fell into FAPLA hands on 8 February, the ports of Lobito and Benguela on 10 February. By 14 February, control of the Benguala railway was complete and on 13 March UNITA lost its last foothold in far south-eastern Angola, Gago Gouthinho (Lumbala N'Guimbo). It is in this attack that the Cubans for the first time employed their airforce.Four to five thousand SADF troops kept a strip along the Namibian border up to 80 km deep until Angola at least gave assurance that it wouldn't supply bases for SWAPO and that it would continue to supply electricity to Namibia from the Cunene dams. While the Cubans and FAPLA were slowly approaching the southern border, South Africa and the MPLA took up indirect negotiations about South African withdrawal brokered by the British and Soviet governments. Neto ordered FAPLA and the Cubans to halt at a distance to the border, forestalling what some feared might turn into a much bigger conflict. In exchange for South African recognition, he offered to guarantee the safety of South Africa's 180 million USinvestment in the Cunene hydroelectric complex in northwest Namibia, close to the Angolan border. On 25 March, Botha announced the total withdrawal of South African troops from Angola by 27 March 1976. On 27 March, the last 60 military vehicles crossed the border into Namibia.Consolidation With the withdrawal of South Africa, FNLA and UNITA resistance crumbled and the MPLA was left in sole possession of power. With the help of its Cuban allies the MPLA 'not only vanquished its bitterest rivals – the FNLA and UNITA – but in the process had seen off the CIA and humbled the mighty Pretoria war machine.' Whatever remained of UNITA retreated into the Angolan bush and Zaire. A number of African countries publicly discredited UNITA for its links with the apartheid government, the CIA and white mercenaries.The United Nations Security Council met to consider 'the act of aggression committed by South Africa against the People's Republic of Angola' and on 31 March 1976, branded South Africa the aggressor, demanding it provide compensation for war damages. Internationally South Africa found itself completely isolated and the failure of its Operation Savannah left it 'without a single crumb of comfort'. 'The internal repercussions of the Angolan debacle were felt quickly when, on 16 June 1976 – emboldened by the FAPLA-Cuban victory – the Soweto Uprising began, inaugurating a period of civil unrest which was to continue up until and beyond the collapse of apartheid.' Another setback for Pretoria within four years was the end of white minority rule in Rhodesia as it emerged as the next black majority-ruled nation of Zimbabwe, completing the total geographic isolation of apartheid South Africa. Angola obtained recognition by the OAU on 10 February 1976. The OAU recognized the MPLA as Angola's government. The majority of the international community albeit not the U.S. soon did the same. The U.S. was unable to prevent its admittance to the UN General Assembly as its 146th member.At the height of the deployment in 1976, Cuba had 36,000 military personnel stationed in Angola. At their meeting in Conakry on 14 March 1976, when victory was already assured, Castro and Neto decided that the Cubans would withdraw gradually, leaving behind for as long as necessary enough men to organize a strong, modern army, capable of guaranteeing the MPLA's future security without outside help. The Cubans had no intention of getting bogged down in a lengthy internal counter-insurgency and started to reduce their presence in Angola as planned after the retreat of the South Africans. By the end of May, more than 3,000 troops had already returned to Cuba, and many more were on the way. By the end of the year the Cuban troops had been reduced to 12,000.The Cubans had high hopes that after their victory in Angola, in co-operation with the USSR, they could remove all of southern Africa from the influence of the U.S. and China. In Angola, they put up dozens of training camps for Namibian (SWAPO), Rhodesian (ZAPU) and South African (ANC) guerrillas. An SADF intelligence report in 1977 concluded 'that SWAPO's standard of training had improved significantly because of the training they had received from the Cuban instructors'. Cuba saw its second main task in training and equipping the FAPLA which the Soviets generously supplied with sophisticated weapons including tanks and an own air force with MiG-21 fighters.In early 1977, the new Carter administration had in mind to recognize the MPLA-government despite of the presence of Cuban troops assuming they would be withdrawn once the Namibian issue was settled and the southern border of Angola was secure. The MPLA and Cuban troops had control over all southern cities by 1977, but roads in the south faced repeated UNITA attacks. Savimbi expressed his willingness for rapprochement with the MPLA and the formation of a unity, socialist government, but he insisted on Cuban withdrawal first. 'The real enemy is Cuban colonialism,' Savimbi told reporters, warning, 'The Cubans have taken over the country, but sooner or later they will suffer their own Vietnam in Angola.'On the international stage, Cuba's victory against South Africa boosted Castro's image as one of the top leaders in the Non-Aligned Movement of which he was secretary-general from 1979 to 1983. Although with Cuba's help the MPLA-government became firmly established, Cuban attempts to hand over the defence of the country failed and it soon became drawn into MPLA's war against UNITA.Humanitarian engagement According to the Cubans, the overriding priority of their mission in Angola was humanitarian, not military. In the wake of Operation Carlota, around 5,000 Cuban technical, medical and educational staff were constantly posted in Angola to fill the gaps the Portuguese had left behind. 'For a generation of Cubans, internationalist service in Angola represented the highest ideal of the Cuban Revolution' and for many it became a normal part of life to volunteer for an internationalist mission, principally in Angola, which lasted 18 to 24 months. In the following years, tens of thousands of volunteers were processed each year. By 1978, Angola's health system was almost completely run by Cuban doctors. After the Portuguese left the country, there was only one doctor per 100,000 inhabitants. The Cubans posted a large medical team at Luanda's University and Prenda hospitals and opened clinics in remote areas all across Angola.At the time of independence, over 90", "machine_text": " Cuban intervention in Angola was a military campaign by the Cuban government in support of the Marxist People’s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), which was headed by Agostinho Neto, and fought against the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) and the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA). The campaign lasted from 1975 until 1989 and had a significant effect on the Cold War. The Cuban presence in Angola began during the Cold War civil war and Portuguese Colonial War in the 1970s. During the onset of the Angolan civil war, Cuba provided boots-on-the-ground support for the communist MPLA. The MPLA gained power in Angola when Portugal declared their independence in 1975. Cuba sent military advisers and troops from as early as 1973 to support the MPLA. Cuban combat forces, which included about 15,000 Cuban-trained Angolan soldiers, eventually grew to more than 55,000 troops. The Cuban-trained Angolan forces in Angola, known as the ‘Cuban Intervention Force’, were heavily involved in the military campaign against the two main opposition forces, UNITA and the FNLA. In 1975, Cuban president Fidel Castro authorized the creation of Cuban forces in Angola, which met with some success and contributed greatly to the Angolan victory. By the end of the war in 1989, Cuban forces had suffered over 2,000 casualties. The presence of Cuban forces in Angola had a major impact on the Cold War. Cuban forces were able to bolster the MPLA and effectively fight off the United States-backed UNITA, as well as disrupting apartheid forces operating in Angola. American and South African forces coordinated their efforts with UNITA and the FNLA to fight the Cuban forces, but the Cuban forces were too strong. Cuban involvement in Angola had a major impact on the Cold War and was an example of Cuba’s commitment to international solidarity. Cuban intervention in Angola ended in 1989 when the MPLA was officially declared the legitimate ruling party. The Cuban Intervention in Angola was a major event in the Cold War and is still remembered today for its significance in international security. The Cuban military presence in Angola was important in preventing the spread of apartheid and is seen as an example of international solidarity and cooperation.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 14924212}

Canada constructed nine sites to study cosmic rays, but this site in particular was the most important due to its higher elevation. The National Research Council constructed a laboratory at the site in the winter of 1956–57. The building was not visible from the Banff townsite as a condition of its construction.The station was run by Dr. B. G. Wilson with the help of two assistantsand was equipped with a standard IGY neutron monitor. The national research council maintained its operation until 1960 when the University of Calgary took over its operations and Dr. Wilson found a permanent position there. An improved NM64 neutron monitor was installed in 1963 but the IGY monitor continued to operate until 1972. The station ceased operations in 1978 and the building was dismantled in 1981. In 1982 it was designated as a National Historic Site.

It is currently maintained by the University of Alberta Department of Physics and Astronomy. The observatory was constructed in the late 1950s, completing construction in 1962 and officially opening on June 22 of that year by the University of Alberta and the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory. The main purpose of the station was to perform research on cosmic rays, conduct atmospheric and space research, as well as to provide educational opportunities for University of Alberta students. The facility is equipped with several instruments, including various cosmic ray detectors, magnetometers, and a spectrograph. It is unique among observatories because of its high altitude, allowing it to measure higher energy particles than observatories at lower altitudes. The cosmic ray detectors at Sulphur Mountain are Gaseous Detector Proportional Counters, or GPCs. These detectors can measure the energy and direction of the primary and secondary particles that compose cosmic rays. The detectors measure the transmitted muon flux from cosmic rays from the ground, as well as the vertical and downward going particles. Data from these detectors are transmitted on the internet in real time, allowing the results from the Cosmic Ray Station to be disseminated and accessed by researchers. The magnetometers measure the Earth's magnetic field to determine possible correlation between its fluctuations and cosmic rays. Like the GPCs, data from the magnetometers is available online for monitoring in real time. The spectrograph, on the other hand, measures the spectral lines of stars and other celestial objects, allowing researchers to identify and measure their properties. The Sulphur Mountain Cosmic Ray Station has been involved in various research projects throughout the years, including a study on the solar cycle and its correlation to cosmic ray activity. It has also been used to investigate possible correlations between cosmic rays and climate variability and to observe particle showers caused by gamma ray bursts. The Sulphur Mountain Cosmic Ray Station is a unique and invaluable research facility that continues to contribute to the understanding of cosmic rays and humanity's place in the universe.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2053847}

He was the Welsh Bantamweight Champion.Amateur boxing career According to boxing historian, Gareth Jones, Cuthbert Taylor began boxing as a youth, fighting with his father, at the boxing booths in travelling fairs that toured the country. He won the 1922 Amateur Boxing Association British flyweight title, when boxing out of the Cardiff Gabalfa ACC, and was selected to represent Britain in the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. He defeated Juan José Trillo of Argentina but he was eliminated in the quarter-finals of the flyweight class after losing his fight to the upcoming silver medallist Armand Apell.1928 Olympic resultsRound of 32: byeRound of 16: defeated Juan Jose Trillo (Argentina) by decisionQuarterfinal: lost to Armand Apell (France) by decisionProfessional boxing career On returning to Wales he turned professional fighting Manchester's Jackie Brown at Merthyr Tydfil on 29 December 1928. The contest ended in a draw, which was followed by his first professional win, over Lud Abella and a loss to Phineas John. By May 1929 Taylor was invited to fight at the National Sporting Club in London, losing by points in a 15-round match against Bert Kirby.On 29 July 1929, Taylor had moved up a weight division, and challenged Dan Dando for the Welsh Bantamweight Championship, defeating Dando on points. His reign was short lived when he lost the title just over a month later to Phineas John. Taylor challenged twice more for the Welsh Bantamweight belt, failing on both occasions, both against Stanley Jehu, first for the vacant title in 1930 and then an unsuccessful challenge in 1931.In total Taylor fought 247 professional bouts, with 151 wins, 69 losses and 22 draws. In all his fights he was knocked out only once, by Tommy Hyams at Selhurst Park in 1932. None of Taylor's fights were conducted outside Britain. Including amateur fights he recorded over 250 victories.Colour bar Between 1911 and 1948 the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC) operated a colour bar which prevented non-white boxers from competing for British titles. As his father was black, Taylor was deemed 'not white enough to be British' and was denied the opportunity to challenge for any professional national belts, despite being the first black boxer to represent Great Britain at the Olympics.In 2021, as part of Black History Month, a plaque was unveiled at The Court House in Merthyr Tydfil, where Taylor used to train. His family took this opportunity to demand an apology from the BBBofC, for their discriminatory actions of the past towards Taylor and the other black boxers who were barred from competing for the British titles. Their cause was championed by Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney Member of Parliament, Gerald Jones, who raised the issue on the floor of the House of Commons on 27 October.NotesExternal linksCuthbert Taylor's profile at databaseOlympics.com Cuthbert Taylor's profile at Sports Reference.com1909 births 1977 deaths Sportspeople from Merthyr Tydfil Welsh male boxers Flyweight boxers Bantamweight boxers Olympic boxers of Great Britain Boxers at the 1928 Summer Olympics", "machine_text": " Cuthbert Taylor (1812-1895) was an English chess player of the 19th century, widely believed to be one of the top chess players of his time.

Taylor was an active participant in the American chess scene as soon as he arrived in the US. He quickly established himself as one of the leading players in the country, winning multiple tournaments. His first major victory was the 1847 New York Chess Club tournament, in which he beat Albert Hodges of Mississippi in the final round. In addition to his tournament success, Taylor wrote several books on chess and wrote chess columns for various newspapers and journals. In 1855, Taylor joined the first organized group of American chess players, the Independent Club of Chess Players, which marked the beginning of American chess as a mainstream activity. Taylor was a leader in the organization, serving as president for two years. During his tenure, the club established a number of rules and regulations which became the basis for modern American chess. Taylor was an active tournament player until 1883. He won numerous tournaments during his career, including the All-America Chess Tournament at the Fifth American Chess Congress in 1871. He also served as a judge and arbiter at a number of tournaments throughout the United States. In addition to his chess accomplishments, Taylor was also a successful business entrepreneur. He held several prominent positions in various companies, including vice president and treasurer of the Merchants' Insurance Company and secretary of the Liberty Mining and Smelting Company. In 1895, Taylor died of Bright's disease in Onondaga County, New York.

His unit was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation and Bronze Star for bravery for a multi-ship raid into Tokyo Bay.He was demoted from Signalman 3rd class to Seaman 1st class when his commanding officer told him to hop to it and Bob proceeded to jump up and down on the deck of the USS Brush. At the train station in Atwater Village (Glendale), upon his return from the South Pacific theater, he saw the coffins of many of his classmates from Marshall High who had died, and did not live to see a world without war. When the war ended, he attended Los Angeles City College and then the University of Arizona on the GI bill. A radio program director from WHB in Kansas City heard Arbogast's nighttime show on the university's radio station and hired him immediately.Career Bob went to Chicago's WMAQ where he worked with Pete Robinson from 1951 to 1953 (using as a theme song a charming version of Sicilian Tarantella played on an ocarina) before moving to Los Angeles for a time, then returning to Illinois where he worked at WEAW in Evanston, Illinois. Then he went to New York where he wrote for two shows, one featuring Tom Poston and another Peter Marshall. Then he worked at San Francisco's KSFO and KFRC. He later worked at many stations in Los Angeles including KMPC from 1962 to 1967, KLAC in 1967, KFI in 1968, and KGBS in 1969.At KMPC, he wrote for Dick Whittinghill and Gary Owens, and he wrote with and was the partner of Jack Margolis at KLAC and KGBS.Their radio talk show at KLAC had the highest rating of any radio program in LA history up until that time (and perhaps still), with a 14.5 percent share of the audience.Due to a concentrated letter-writing campaign, they were fired for their objection to the Vietnam war and their pro-choice stance.They may have been among the last fired due to the McCarthy dealings of the 1950s.The pair also hosted a TV show on KTTV for a while.Arbogast created the Question Man in Kansas City in 1951 and used it on the Poston Show in NY. It was later a feature on The Steve Allen Show, to the surprise of Bob and Steve - as Allen acknowledged in his book, The Question Man.The concept lived on in Johnny Carson's Carnac the Magnificent and Jeopardy!.In 1958, Arbogast teamed with Stanley Ralph Ross to write and perform the hit 45 rpm single 'Chaos, Parts 1 and 2,' which when it came out (on Liberty Records #55197), sold 10,000 copies in three days, and then was banned from radio play on the fourth day - when stations realized that it satirized 'Top 40' radio.Dr. Demento has kept 'Chaos' alive. In addition, they co-wrote the album of parody songs titled My Son, the Copycat (a take on Allan Sherman's albums) and the book Speak When You Hear the Beep.Arbogast had numerous screen credits for cartoons and commercials and had appeared on television shows and in movies. He did frequent uncredited voiceovers for Sesame Street segments. He was the voice for the original 'What would you do for a Klondike Bar?' advertising campaign and of the animated Granny Goose for the Granny Goose potato chip campaign (What is Granny's secret?I won't say...') Among hundreds, Arbogast is perhaps most famous for his voicings of General G.I. Brassbottom, Noodles Romanoff, and Ma Ramjet in the Roger Ramjet cartoon, Jack Wheeler in the Hot Wheels cartoon, and Snogs on the Hanna-Barbera animated series Monchhichis. He also voiced several characters in the Hanna-Barbera series The Jetsons. Not to be forgotten were Arbo's stylings of Barry Bear and Drummy Drummer, popular seventies pull-string toys - 'I'm Barry Bear, like to meet my paw?''I'm Drummy Drummer.I went to school at the school of hard knocks.' - and his renditions of hamburgers in early McDonald's commercials. While in elementary school at Franklin Avenue in Los Angeles, his son John was scolded when asked by his teacher, Mrs. Horowitz, what his father does for a living. John replied, 'he is a bear.' Refusing to recant, a meeting with the teacher, principal, and Bob resulted in free hot dogs on 'Hot Dog Wednesday' for John for a year. John also has many voices still running on Sesame Street.In 1966 he appeared in the campy horror film 'Batwoman'.One of his most popular bits was his portrayal of little old lady Emily Norton for KMPC.Among his many TV and radio commercial partners were Pat Harrington, Harry Morgan, Doris Roberts, Joan Gerber, Edie McClurg, Bob Elliott, Albert Brooks, Shelley Berman, Tim Conway, Lorenzo Music, Gene Moss and Casey Kasem.Arbogast won an Emmy as a writer for Stars of Jazz in 1958 and a Clio in the '70's, for the Highland Appliance Co. of Detroit. He wrote for Sesame Street and The Pat Paulsen Show. He also has the dubious distinction of writing for the shortest-lived television show ever, Turn-On, which was canceled after one night because it satirized, among others, the Pope. He co-starred (had two lines and 6 minutes on camera) with Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn in the motion picture The Falcon and the Snowman and he drove the bus in Linda Lovelace for President.Arbogast was a jazz aficionado, Chicago Cubs and UCLA Bruins fan, and animal lover.He and his wife, Jan, lived in Mariposa, California, tending to their garden, caring for their pets, and the pleasures of the internet, satellite radio and television.With his previous wife, Joanna, he raised a daughter and three sons. His oldest son Peter is the radio voice of USC Trojan football. His middle son John is a USC honors grad, a decorated Coast Guard officer, retired Los Angeles city park ranger, history teacher, city champion pole vault coach and assistant track and field coach at John Marshall High School. His youngest son Jerry is a UCLA graduate and a retired physical education teacher and tennis coach in the Los Angeles Unified School District. His daughter Paula retired in June 2006 from her position as a teachers' union representative. With his first wife, Tobi, he had a son, Robert Jr. (Ted), an accomplished musical director and band leader, and the technology coordinator for Terlingua High School in Texas. Bob is also survived by six grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.ReferencesExternal linksListen to Chaos (KAOS Radio)1953 Arbogast Show1927 births 2009 deaths American talk radio hosts American male voice actors American male radio actors American television writers American male television writers Emmy Award winners Clio Award winners Los Angeles City College alumni University of Arizona alumni People from Bellingham, Washington Male actors from Los Angeles People from Mariposa, California Screenwriters from California Screenwriters from Washington (state) Screenwriters from Arizona 20th-century American screenwriters 20th-century American male writers United States Navy personnel of World War II United States Navy non-commissioned officers", "machine_text": " Bob Arbogast (February 20, 1932 – February 20, 2014) was an American football player. He was selected in the fourth round of the 1954 NFL Draft by the New York Giants, but would later go on to play for the Chicago Cardinals and the Los Angeles Rams. His most prominent moment in NFL history came during the 1958 NFL Championship Game when his touchdown reception for the Giants from quarterback Charlie Conerly was the winning score in a 23-17 victory over the Baltimore Colts. Arbogast began his football career at Muskegon High School in Michigan, where he was part of the 1947 team that was crowned Ohio Valley football champions. He attended several college and universities in his academic career, including the University of Michigan, where he played for two years as a running back for the Wolverines. After his time at Michigan, Arbogast returned to Muskegon in 1953 where he became the starting quarterback on the high school football team. He would later go on to lead his team to an undefeated season and a league championship. In early 1954, Arbogast was drafted by the New York Giants as the 35th overall pick in the NFL Draft. He didn't get off to the best of starts with the Giants, appearing in only four games in his first NFL season. He would continue to struggle and after the 1956 season he was traded to the Chicago Cardinals, where he played for two more seasons before moving on to the Los Angeles Rams in 1959. Arbogast's big break came in 1958 during the NFL Championship Game against the Baltimore Colts. During the game, he caught a 10-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Charlie Conerly, which ultimately proved to be the winning score for the Giants. The 'Catch' as it came to be known, is seen as one of the most iconic plays in NFL history. Arbogast retired after the 1960 season, finishing his career with 1,374 receiving yards and 11 touchdowns. Since his death in 2014, Arbogast's contributions to the Giants have been honored by the team. The Bob Arbogast Award has been given to an outstanding wide receiver for the Giants since 2016. Arbogast was a beloved figure in Muskegon, Michigan, and to the many fans of the New York Giants. He was inducted into the Muskegon Area Sports Hall of Fame in 1985, and his legacy will continue to be remembered for years to come.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 4723941}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Ski boot\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Ski boots are footwear used in skiing to provide a way to attach the skier to skis using ski bindings. The ski/boot/binding combination is used to effectively transmit control inputs from the skier's legs to the snow.HistorySki boots were leather winter boots, held to the ski with leather straps. As skiing became more specialized, so too did ski boots, leading to the splitting of designs between those for alpine skiing and cross-country skiing.Modern skiing developed as an all-round sport with uphill, downhill and cross-country portions. The introduction of the cable binding started a parallel evolution of binding and boot. The binding looped a strap around the back of the boot to hold it forward into a metal cup at the toe. Boots with the sole extended rearward to produce a flange for the cable to firmly latch to become common, as did designs with semi-circular indentations on the heel for the same purpose.Effective cross-country skiing requires the boot to flex forward to allow a striding action, so the boots were designed around a sole piece that allowed forward flexing while still keeping the foot relatively firm side-to-side. The upper portions, the cuff, was relatively soft, designed primarily for comfort and warmth. Modern cross-country ski boots remain almost unchanged since 1950s, although modern materials have replaced leather and other natural fibres.With the introduction of ski lifts, the need for skiing to get to the top of the hill was eliminated, and a much stiffer design was preferred, providing better control over the ski when sliding downhill. A key development was the invention in 1928 of the Kandahar cable binding, which attached the heel solidly to the ski and used a strong spring to pull the boot forward into the toe iron. The design required a stiffer, reinforced boot sole, often build on a wooden shank. New boots that had been boiled in oil or soaked in glue were introduced to stiffen the upper cuff. These were universally uncomfortable, especially during the break-in period when they were new. Once broken-in, they wore out quickly as they continued to soften up. Racers typically had only weeks to wear a particular pair before it was no longer useful. Another attempt to stiffen the leg/ski connection was the 'long thong', a long leather strap fixed directly to the ski that was wrapped several times around the lower leg and then buckled closed. This offered a great improvement in control, but increased the risk of injury in the event of an accident.AlpineModern alpine ski boots have rigid soles and attach to the ski at both toe and heel using a spring-loaded binding. The interface between boot and binding is standardized by ISO 5355, which defines the size and shape of the hard plastic flanges on the toe and heel of the boot. Ski boots are sized using the Mondopoint system.Front-entry Front-entry (or 'top-entry', rarely 'overlap' or 'Lange') boots have been the primary boot design for most of the history of downhill skiing. The design evolved from existing leather boot through several steps.In 1956, the Swiss factory Henke introduced the buckle boot, using over-center levered latches patented by Hans Martin to replace laces. Laces spread the load across a number of eyelets in the leather, whereas the buckles concentrated the load at only a few points. To spread it back out again, the boots featured C-shaped flaps that stretched over the opening where the laces would be, to the side where the buckles were located. These had the added advantage of also helping block snow from entering the front of the boot.Beginning around 1960 Bob Lange experimented with ways to replace leather with plastic. Early examples used a lace-up design, but in 1964 he combined a new, more flexible polyurethane plastic with the overlapping flap and buckle system from Henke to produce the first recognizably modern ski boot. Production examples appeared in 1966, and when Nancy Greene started winning races on them, the plastic boot became a must-have item. Replacing leather with plastic dramatically improved stiffness and control, along with durability and warmth (leather boots had a way of soaking through, which led to wet, frozen feet). Over time the cuff around the leg evolved upward, starting just over the ankle like leather boots, but rising to a point about half way to the knee by the 1980s. Only minor changes have occurred to this basic design since then.Almost all modern front-entry boots consist of two sections, one around the foot, and another around the lower leg. These are joined by rivets/rotating joints near the ankle that allows the leg to pivot forward, but not to the sides. This allows excellent control by transmitting even the smallest lateral movements of the leg to the ski. However, the rigid cuff also makes them very difficult to put on and take off. Additionally, because the boot clamps across the foot, pulling the sides inward, it is difficult to produce a single design that fits a range of foot shapes and sizes. This leads to shell modification services, when the boot is stretched to fit the skier's foot, typically by heating the plastic and pressing it into place. This is also known as 'blowing' ('punching', 'pushing'). Sometimes material will be ground off the boot to provide more room. This is normally used only with front-entry designs, other designs normally include much more room in the foot area as they do not clamp down the same way.Rear-entry Rear-entry boots were brought to market in the early 1970s by the Hanson brothers to address the issue of getting conventional boots on and off, while also providing a generally better fit. Rear-entry designs were very popular in the 1980s, notably Salomon designs like the racing-oriented SX 91 Equipe.In the rear-entry design, the entire foot area and sole are a single unit similar to a slipper. The leg cuff is split in two, with front and rear sections that meet at the hinge point at the ankle. The rear half of the cuff can pivot far to the rear, opening wide for easy entry. Closing a cable locks the moving rear portion forward onto the front half, forming the stiff cuff that pivots around rivets at the ankle like a conventional front-entry design. As the toe area is a single piece and lacks buckles for adjustment, rear-entry boots may have considerable 'slop', and various systems of cables, plates or foam-filled bladders were used to address this. The upside of this approach is that the foot area can be made larger, fitting almost any foot.The rear entry design fell from popularity in the 1990s due to their shunning by racers in search of a closer fit. Recent improvements to front-entry and mid-entry boots, primarily in the areas of comfort and ease of entry/exit, have diminished the popularity of rear-entry designs even in recreational roles, though mid-range models remain common as rental boots.Three-piece Three-piece (or 'open-throat') boots were first developed by Mel Dalebout (around 1969), who introduced a rigid magnesium boot shell in that year (Brixia did the same thing with their aluminum shell at around the same time). The big advantage was that the main shell was a single piece that was convex at all points, meaning it could be easily produced using a plug mould. Conventional boots with overlapping flaps required more complex moulding processes. Engineers at Henke, Heierling, Sanmarco and Caber saw the advantage for high-speed moulding, and plastic three-piece boots were on the market by 1972, when Roland Collombin won the Olympic downhill in the Henke Strato.Boot designer Sven Coomer later improved the design with a corrugated tongue, and this technique was commercialized by Comfort Products, an Aspen, Colo. company owned by the ex-ski racer Erik Giese. Giese licensed Coomer's concept to the Swiss company Raichle-Molitor; the company introduced it in 1979 as the Flexon, which became very popular among downhill racers and mogul skiers. The Flexon was extremely popular among professional skiers, especially for moguls and freestyle, but a series of business blunders put Raichle out of business in the late 1990s. Several companies produce three-piece designs today, often referred to as 'cabrio' boots (after convertible-top cabriolet vehicles), and they are once again becoming popular models.The design closely resembles a conventional front-entry design, with separate foot and leg sections riveted at the ankle. However, the overlapping flaps of these designs are cut away, leaving a slot-like opening running down the front of the leg and over the foot. A separate plastic tongue is positioned over this opening on the front of the boot, and buckled down to close it. The open cuff (the 'throat') makes the boots easy to get on and off, and the shaping of the tongue allows complete control over the forward flex. A single shell can be used with different tongues to provide any needed flex pattern from racing-stiff to freestyle-soft.Hybrid leather The introduction of plastic boots in the 1960s led a number of companies to introduce 'hybrid' boots with plastic inserts for additional lateral strength. These were widespread in the late 1960s, especially from the large collection of Italian bookmakers in Montebelluna, before they started introducing all-plastic designs of their own. Typical designs used a plastic insert wrapping around the heel area and extending up to just below the ankle, allowing the skier to force their foot sideways and offering some edging control. Others, notably 1968's Raichle Fibre Jet, wrapped a soft leather boot in an external fibreglass shell, producing a side-entry design that was not particularly successful. Hybrid designs often incorporated elements of the side-entry or three-piece designs. The Fibre Jet shared much in common with the Rosemount design, for instance.Side-entry Introduced by Rosemount in 1965, side-entry design consisted of an almost completely enclosed shell with a cut-out section on one side. The cut-out was covered by a flap that hinged along the back of the boot, swinging to the rear to open. Stepping in was very easy, simply sliding the foot sideways in through the opening, then swinging the flap closed and stretching a fabric cover over it to seal it. As the upper and lower sections both opened, metal plates were needed on the sides to connect the two mechanically. A problem was that the boot did not meet perfectly along the join, allowing snow to force its way into the boot, although improvements were continuous. This design fell from use in the 1970s as higher-cuff front-entry boots became largely universal.External frames The ski boot provides four functions; protecting the foot from the elements, providing a mounting point for the binding, and transmitting forces between the leg and the ski. In theory, there's no reason these have to be combined in a single unit, and several designs have split these functions up. One example is the Nava System from the 1980s, which used a soft boot that clipped into custom bindings, and an arm that extended up from the rear binding to wrap around the leg and provide lateral control.Knee-highs In 1980 four designs were introduced that all rose to a point just under the knee. They were normal ski boots below, but used an extended tongue that fastened around the upper leg using a variety of methods. They offered much greater edging control, and were quickly copied by many other companies. They all disappeared by 1983, a victim largely of fashion - ski pants wouldn't fit over them. None are produced today.NordicCross-country and telemark Cross-country boots, like all Nordic equipment, attach to the ski usually only at the toe of the boot and are allowed to flex at the ball of the foot similarly to a normal shoe or boot. Cross-country boots generally use one of four attachment systems; NNN (New Nordic Norm), 75mm Nordic Norm ('three-pin' binding, '75NN'), d-ring, or SNS (Salomon Nordic System). A four-pin binding system similar to 75NN used to be popular in the USSR. A new Salomon Pilot binding is now widely used for racing because it uses two connection points so that the skier has more stability and control over the ski. As these boots are intended for travel over generally flat terrain, they are optimized for light weight and efficiency of motion.Telemark refers to a specific technique for making downhill turns on Nordic equipment. This has resulted in highly specialized equipment designed for better performance in a downhill setting. Until 1992 Telemark boots were basically heavy leather boots with the front of the sole adapted to the 75mm Nordic Norm. The introduction of the New Telemark Norm (NTN) binding in 2007 change the technique dramatically. Since then plastic boots have become more and more common and now make up almost all Telemark boots. Plastic allows for a laterally stiffer boot while still allowing freedom of flex at the ball of the foot through the use of bellows. Boots intended for more cross country travel generally have a lower cuff, softer flex and lighter weight. Boots specialized for downhill use have higher cuffs, stiffer flex and heavier weight. Telemark boots are almost always equipped with a rubber sole.Alpine touringAlthough randonnée is considered as an alpine sport, it basically combines the cross-country stride for uphill portions and then conventional alpine techniques on the downhill. The equipment uses most closely compares to modern telemark systems, with a stiff plastic boot offering good downhill control, and a binding system that allows it to pivot at the toe for cross-country striding. Different models trade off light weight against downhill performance. They have a rockered, rubber sole to allow for easier walking. This means that they will not fit in ordinary alpine bindings. Instead, the interface between alpine touring boots and bindings is defined by ISO 9523. Other attachment methods exist and prominent amongst these are the Tech bindings and fittings that were first commercialized by Dynafit as the TLT. As yet, these are not covered by an international standard.SnowboardingDownhill techniques, alpine, telemark and snowboarding, all perform turns by rotating the ski or board onto its edge. Once on edge, the curved pattern cut into the side (the 'sidecut') causes the ski or board to bend into a curve. As they move forward over the snow, this curved shape causes them to turn.Snowboard boots and bindings are normally far simpler than their downhill counterparts, rarely including release systems for instance, and need to provide mechanical support only in the fore and aft directions. These typically consist of an external frame, generally L shaped, which the snowboarder steps into and then fastens down using straps over the boot. The boot itself is not as responsible for transmitting forces, and can be much softer than a typical downhill boot. When the sport was first introduced, normal winter boots were used, but today it is much more common to use semi-stiff snowboarding boots. Some specialty disciplines use harder boots with step-in bindings more similar to downhill systems, but these are not widely used outside these fields, even though some downhill sports teachers use these so they can switch between snowboarding or skiing classes without having to change boots.See also Ski bindingReferencesExternal linksBoots Sports footwear Boot", "machine_text": " Ski boot is a type of footwear specially designed to be used in skiing activities. It is an important equipment used both in alpine and Nordic skiing. Ski boot is the most important piece of ski equipment as it provides the skier with direct contact and control over the ski. The ski boot consists of a shell, which is usually made of a lightweight and stiff material such as polyurethane or polyvinyl chloride. It also has a lining and cushioning material, usually foam, to provide comfort and protection. The outer sole of ski boot usually is made of rubber or nylon. In order to provide strong and secure attachment to the ski, modern ski boot is designed with a specific type of boot binding. It is usually either a step-in type of binding or a plate-based binding. The ski boot is divided into two categories; the hard shell ski boot and the soft shell ski boot. Hard shell ski boot is stiffer and more rigid than its soft shell counterpart, providing maximum power transfer to the ski. It is heavy, rigid, and offers great support for the skier's feet, ankles and legs. The rigid sole of hard shell ski boot offers great stability during sharp turns, while the cushioning and lining offer comfort. Soft shell ski boot is designed to provide more freedom of movement while still providing support and control. The outer sole of soft shell ski boot offers less stability as compared to hard shell ski boot, but more maneuverability and comfort. The flex of ski boot is an important component to consider when selecting the ski boot. A proper flex allows the boot to properly absorb the pressure and shock of skiing. Soft boots are ideal for beginner skiers and for geometrical turns, while stiffer flex boots are ideal for more advanced skiers where more powerful turns are required. Ski boot technology has been constantly evolving over the years. The introduction of power strap, ratchet buckles, and plastic buckles were some of the first major improvements in ski boot technology. There are now a wide range of ski boots available designed to suit skiers' needs, from entry-level models to advanced ones with the latest technology. Ski boots have also been equipped with thermal insulation material to help keep the foot warm in cold weather. Ultimately, ski boot is an important piece of skiing equipment that should be properly chosen in order to ensure maximum efficiency and comfort while skiing. A ski boot that fits properly and is designed specifically for an individual's needs is essential in order to make skiing an enjoyable experience.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 335207}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Facet (geometry)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "In geometry, a facet is a feature of a polyhedron, polytope, or related geometric structure, generally of dimension one less than the structure itself. More specifically:In three-dimensional geometry, a facet of a polyhedron is any polygon whose corners are vertices of the polyhedron, and is not a face. To facet a polyhedron is to find and join such facets to form the faces of a new polyhedron; this is the reciprocal process to stellation and may also be applied to higher-dimensional polytopes.In polyhedral combinatorics and in the general theory of polytopes, a facet of a polytope of dimension n is a face that has dimension n − 1. Facets may also be called (n − 1)-faces. In three-dimensional geometry, they are often called 'faces' without qualification.A facet of a simplicial complex is a maximal simplex, that is a simplex that is not a face of another simplex of the complex. For (boundary complexes of) simplicial polytopes this coincides with the meaning from polyhedral combinatorics.ReferencesExternal linksPolyhedra Polyhedral combinatorics Polytopes", "machine_text": " Facet (geometry) is a term used to describe the numerous flat faces or side surfaces of a three-dimensional object. It is alos referred to as a face, which can refer to either one of the side surfaces or to multiple side surfaces. Each of these facets of a polyhedron, or three-dimensional shape, serve as two-dimensional boundaries or molds of the three-dimensional shape. In Euclidean geometry, a facet of a polyhedron is defined as a piece of the surface that can be bounded by a single line or circle. The edges of the facets are also traditional lines or circles, depending on the shape of the polyhedron. In general, a facet must contain at least three edges, since fewer than three edges can only define a straight line and cannot bound a surface. The number of faces, or facets, a three-dimensional object has is related to the degree of rotation symmetry the object has. A cube, for example, has six faces since it is only able to rotate symmetrically in a full 90-degree increment. While a cube has six faces, it has twelve edges, and eight vertices. It is easy to tell that a shape is a cube or cuboid, as it is defined by its facets: each face is composed of squares, hence there are six facets and the shape itself will have an even number of degrees of symmetry (six). Other three-dimensional shapes such as cylinders, pyramids and cones, have a variety of facets and angles, and no two shapes have exactly the same number of facets. Faceted crystals, such as diamonds, are also known as gemstones, and these types of crystals are commonly prized for their aesthetic beauty. Faceted crystals often have many flat, smoothly polished faces which reflect light, a property which enables the gemstones to sparkle. Each of the faces of a faceted crystal is known as a 'facet', with different angles and sizes lending each crystal its individual and unique beauty. In the manufacturing industry, facets are also used as design elements. Facets in product designs can emphasize the underlying shape of the product, and are used to create streamlined or winding shapes. These shapes, however, are usually accomplished by machining rather than facet grinding as this allows for more precise angles and dimensions. Facet is a versatile word, which is not limited to Euclidean geometry, gemstones, and product design but is also used in computer science, economics and other fields. In computer science, for instance, the word facet can be used to describe characteristics of data, while in economics, facets of narrative or information can be used to describe the outcomes of a system or process.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 7186647}

In 1974 he started to work for Sara Lee, where he ultimately became the president of the board of directors.On 31 December 1993 he withdrew from Sara Lee. In the beginning of 1994 he was asked by former Philips top executive Jan Timmer to participate in the Board of Directors of Philips, to breathe new life to the brand Philips. Boonstra was responsible for the 'Let's make things better'- campaign.Two years after his commencement of employment with Philips, Boonstra became the successor of Timmer as the president of the board of directors. He held this leading position until 2001. While Boonstra was in charge, the market-value of Philips increased fivefold mainly by focusing on short-term profits and selling off company units like BSO/Origin (now a part of Atos and record company PolyGram. During his leadership he moved the head office (the top 350 employees) of Philips from Eindhoven to Amsterdam, the capital of the country. Since most of the regular staff remained in Eindhoven, the birthplace of the company, this move was not popular among Philips employees. In 2000 Boonstra was chosen 'top executive of the year'. Boonstra divorced two times, and has two children (Cor Boonstra and Roelof Boonstra) of his first wife.In 1998 Boonstra and his first wife barely survived a hijacking. At that time Boonstra already was having an affair with Sylvia Tóth. A few years later, Boonstra was accused of insider trading in which he allegedly earned several hundreds of thousands of euros by trading in Endemol shares (where Sylvia Tóth was a member of the board) just before that company was acquired by the Spanish Telefónica. Boonstra was ultimately acquitted in court as no hard evidence existed that his partner Tóth had shared the information on the impending deal with him. The Dutch press referred to the inside deal as the 'pillow talk deal'.A few months later Cor Boonstra was again charged for not reporting trading in Ahold shares where he himself was a member of the board.

They are found in most parts of the world, although they are most diverse in the tropics. They are fairly small butterflies, typically with a wingspan of 1 to 2 inches (25 to 50 mm). The genus is divided into several subgenera, including Cyanophrys, Euarchon, Ortharchon and Pararchon. Each of these subgenera contains several species of Archon, with the most commonly encountered being the North American species Parrhasius m-album and A. rectiatellum in Central and South America. The majority of Archon butterflies are diurnal, meaning they fly around during the day. They prefer open terrain, such as grassy areas or fields, where they hunt for their preferred food, pollen. They are typically found in small groups, usually of 2 to 4 individuals. The undersides of Archon wings are brightly coloured, usually in orange, yellow or white, with black spots or stripes. The upper sides are usually greyish or brownish. The caterpillars of Archon butterflies feed on the underside of leaves of various plants. Archon butterflies are often mistaken for another genus of butterfly, the Lycaena. However, they are easily distinguished by their different patterns of colour on the wings. Archon butterflies have several different predators. These include other butterflies, birds, small mammals and even spiders.

Born Sitok Sunarto in Purwodadi, Central Java, he became interested in literature at a young age and was heavily influenced by his village's strong oral tradition. When he moved to Jakarta to complete his university studies, he became involved with the Bengkel Teater under Rendra. Sitok remained with the company for almost a decade, appearing in several plays as he refined his literary style. His first poetry collection, Persetubuhan Liar, was published in 1992.Sitok has since published multiple poetry collections, including a bilingual work titled On Nothing and a trilogy of revised editions known collectively as Tripitakata, as well as a novel and serial. He has presented his poetry in such countries as the Netherlands and Germany, and participated in writers workshops in Hong Kong and Iowa. His poems, noted for their 'laconic, muscular, and musical' poetic phrase, have been adapted to music in a variety of genres. In 1999, Asiaweek described Sitok as 'Indonesia's best young poet'.BiographyEarly life Sitok Srengenge was born Sitok Sunarto in Dorolegi, Purwodadi, Central Java, on 22 August 1965. Though the villagers did not support their children attending school, and elders would chase prospective students away, they maintained a strong oral tradition that Sitok credits with influencing the sonic qualities of his poetry. As a youth he was active in theatre, and by junior high school he had begun to write poetry. In a 2004 interview, he stated 'All I knew was that writing those words that lingered in my head made me happy'.Despite the resistance against education, Sitok obtained a scholarship which allowed him to complete his elementary and secondary school studies in the provincial capital of Semarang. He graduated from Senior High School 1, Semarang, in 1985.Theatre and first collection In 1985, Sitok moved to Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, to study at the Faculty of Art and Literature of the Jakarta Teacher Training Institute. There he became involved with Bengkel Teater under the poet-cum-dramatist Rendra, who gave him the name Sitok Srengenge, which translates from Javanese as 'the only sun'. In his ten years with Bengkel Teater, Sitok practiced poetry, monologues, and acting, and appeared in several of the troupe's plays.Sitok published his first poetry collection, Persetubuhan Liar, in 1992. Funded by the singer-songwriter Iwan Fals, this collection was intended as a counterpoint to the rise in religious literature which had become popular in Indonesia in the early 1990s.In the mid-1990s Sitok became an independent artist, acting under directors such as Ikranegara (Jam Berapa Sekarang) and Ratna Sarumpaet (Pesta Terakhir); he has remained active into the 2010s, portraying the Mahabharata warrior Karna in a 2011 play by Goenawan Mohamad. He also established his own theater troupe, Teater Matahari, as well as the Keranjang Sampah Kebudayaan ('Cultural Wastebin') discussion forum.Short stories by Sitok were included in the short story anthology Para Pembohong (The Liars) in 1996. Publication of the anthology was supported by Sitok's organization Gorong-Gorong Budaya, meant to encourage and support pro-democracy artists. Sitok was a founding member and one of the directors of the Utan Kayu Arts Community Center, serving as the director of its literary biennale and editor of its journal Kalam during the 1990s and 2000s. Beginning in 2007, he served as a curator for the Salihara cultural center until his resignation in 2013.As a student, Sitok was involved in pro-democracy rallies against President Suharto. In the lead-up to Suharto's 1998 resignation, he would often attend underground rallies and discussions, reciting verses of poetry. None of these works had been anthologized by 2006. Sitok was one of the participants in the 1995 Istiqlal International Poetry Reading conference, which focused predominantly on Islamic poetry, and several of his poems were included in its publication The Poet's Chant. Bulgarian translations of his works were published in Chants of Nusantara that year.Subsequent collections In 1999, Asiaweek wrote that Sitok 'is considered Indonesia's best young poet [and] often thought ... as contributing to the 'reawakening' of Indonesian literature'. The magazine selected him as 'one of twenty leaders for the Millennium in society and culture in Asia'. The translator and Indonesianist Harry Aveling, in his 2001 anthology Secrets Need Words, described Sitok as a 'pioneer' leading poets out of 'the fear that froze the poets of the eighties'.In 2000, Sitok published Anak Jadah (Bastard), a collection of poems described by Yenni Kwok of the Sunday Morning Post as 'a statement about the confusion of his generation'. Explaining the title, Sitok stated that 'Tradition and modernisation met in a careless encounter' producing 'a generation of cultural bastards'. A second poetry collection, Nonsens, was published later that year by the Kalam Foundation in collaboration with the Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies, Ford Foundation, and Adikarya IKAPI Foundation. The collection contained thirty-five works, as well as several illustrations by Agus Suwage.Sitok published his debut novel, Menggarami Burung Terbang (Salting a Flying Bird), in 2004. The work follows a group of common villagers (the Javanese wong cilik) in the period following the coup attempt of 1965. Pamela Allen, writing in Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde, found the novel to have a 'rich, dense blend of realist prose in Indonesian, Javanese mythology and Javanese language', making it unprecedented in works of Indonesian literature which deal with the subject matter. She argued that Sitok used local colour (warna lokal) not as a simple backdrop to a nationalist discourse, but rather to grant 'real insight into local ways of thinking and interpreting the world'.Sitok released a bilingual volume of his poetry, On Nothing, at the Ubud Writers and Readers Festival. The poems in this second collection ranged from 'gentle and romantic' to 'drenched in erotic images and metaphors'. The edition, published by Sitok's own publishing house Kata Kita, contains Indonesian and English versions of poems from his first four poetry collections, translated by four writers: Nukila Amal, Hasif Amini, Margaret Glade-Agusta, and Lauren Bain. of The Jakarta Post found 'both structured and unstructured poetry' and 'themes connected to the human condition, such as love, motherhood, childbirth and racism' in the collection.A trilogy of poetry collections, titled Tripitakata, was released in 2013. Its first volume, Gembala Waktu dan Madah Pereda Rindu, contained poems written by Sitok while still in senior high school and university, up through 1989.The second volume, Kelenjar Bekisar Jantan dan Stanza Hijau Muda, was expanded on the previous collections Persetubuhan Liar and Kelenjar Bekisar Jantan with poems written between 1986 and 1991. The third, Anak Badai dan Amsal Puisi Banal, contained the poems of Anak Jadah as well as other poems written between 1986 and 1991. In August 2015, Sitok released another poetry collection, Ereignis dan Cinta yang Keras Kepala, which contained fifty poems written between 2010 and 2014.Sitok has attended several writers workshops, including at the University of Iowa (2001) and Hong Kong Baptist University (2005). He has read his poems at the Indische Festival in the Hague, the Winternachten Festival in the Hague, the University of Leiden, and the University of Hamburg.Style In a 1999 interview with Asiaweek, Sitok compared writing to boxing, with essays and other prose as shadowboxing and poetry as 'real' boxing. When reciting his poetry, he prefers rote memorization over reading published or written editions – something unusual among Indonesian poets. Sirikit Syah of The Jakarta Post describes him as having 'a powerful voice and impressive stage rhythm' and of being 'a master of lexicon'. Krassin Himmirsky, who translated several of Sitok's poems into Bulgarian, found his 'poetic phrase ... laconic, muscular, and musical', with a universal message.Regarding the writing process, Sitok has stated that 'There are poems within me. They are just there.' He composes his poetry in his mind, and is reluctant to write them unless they are completed. He may produce as few as two poems a year. He says that, although he may occasionally be influenced by politics, he tries to separate civic involvement and writing.Impact and critical receptionSitok's work has been adapted to various media. In 2011, Dian HP produced Delapan Komposisi Cinta (Eight Compositions of Love), a concert for Ubiet Raseuki, using lyrics taken directly from the poems of Sitok and Nirwan Dewanto. In 2012 she released Semesta Cinta, an album of art songs based on Sitok's poetry. The Australian writer Jan Cornall released a jazz album, Singing Srengenge, based on the poet's work; Sitok's works have also been adapted by Denise Jannah and David Kotlowy.Sitok's poetry has been compared to the work of numerous other poets, both Indonesian and non-Indonesian, including Pablo Neruda, Chairil Anwar, Iwan Simatupang, and Sitor Situmorang. Cornall describes Srengenge's work as 'deeply spiritual in the true sense of the word ... where the sensuality of longing, the beauty of sorrow, and the wisdom of deeply felt observation becomes the language of the soul'. Himmirsky finds Sitok's poems to include 'the true values of life, its pulsating dynamism and wisdom. ... [Readers] are deeply moved by his affection for his beloved, for his parents, for the human race.' The translator John McGlynn writes that Sitok 'explores topics with a depth and maturity not only rare among his peers, but also with a vocabulary and clarity that few other poets can match'.Personal life Sitok is married to Farah Maulida. The couple have a daughter, Laire Siwi Mentari. She is a novelist, publishing her debut work Nothing but Love in 2004; by 2009 it had sold more than 40,000 copies. She has published a further novel, Aphrodite, and in 2009 was working on a short story collection.The family lives in Bantul, Yogyakarta. Their home, construction of which began in 2006, sits onof land and holds six buildings: the main house, a joglo style pavilion, a public library, private office, communal kitchen, and guest house.

She was born in Central Java and grew up in a family that was strongly influenced by Hindu and Islamic traditions. As a young girl, she was inspired by the experiences of her great-grandmothers, who were both survivors of the Indonesian Revolution of 1945-1949. She was particularly interested in the stories of the female peasantry and their struggles during this turbulent period. In 1982, she completed her undergraduate degree in anthropology from the University of Indonesia and started working as a research assistant for the Foundation for the Protection of Women's Rights in the same year. It was through this work that she became increasingly aware of the inequities that Indonesian women often face. In 1986, Srengenge earned her Masters degree in anthropology from UCSD. Following her studies, she worked as a lecturer at the University of Indonesia, where she lectured on postcolonial studies, gender and development, and sociology. She went on to complete her Doctoral studies at the University of Leiden in Holland in 1992. As a researcher and lecturer, Sitok Srengenge has been particularly influential in Indonesia. She has written and published numerous books on the marginalization of women and the impact of colonialism in Indonesia. Her views have influenced a generation of Indonesian scholars, both male and female, who are now exploring issues around gender, power, and identity. In 2011, she was awarded the prestigious Fukuoka Prize by the Japanese government, in recognition of her contributions to the promotion of culture in Indonesia and Southern Asia. She is currently a professor at the University of Indonesia and continues to write books and contribute to the discourse on postcolonial Indonesia. Sitok Srengenge is an important figure in contemporary Indonesian discourse. As a highly respected author and anthropologist, her work has had a significant impact on the study of gender and postcolonial issues in Indonesia.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 47910364}

The page has been divided into sections based on the era in which the Go players played and the country in which they played. As this was not necessarily their country of birth, a flag of that country precedes every player's name. For a complete list of player articles, see :Category:Go players.The important dates that this separation is based on are:The establishment of the Four go houses at the start of the Tokugawa Shogunate.The demise of the houses in the Meiji Period (end 19th century) followed by their replacement by the Nihon Kiin in 1924.The start of international tournament Go in 1989A Japanese census on Go players performed in 2002 estimates that over 24 million people worldwide play Go, most of whom live in Asia. Most of the players listed on this article are professionals, though some top level amateurs have been included. Players famous for achievements outside Go are listed in their own section.Prior to 17th centuryWei Qi was recorded throughout the history of China. The first record of Wei Qi player was by Mencius.China17th through 19th centuries In the 17th, 18th and 19th century, Go was popular in both Japan (Edo period) and China (period of the Qing Dynasty). In Korea, a Go variant called Sunjang baduk was played.Japan At the start of the Tokugawa Shogunate, four Go academies were established. This table lists all heads of these houses, as well as some that were appointed heir but died before they became head of the house. Tokugawa also established the post of Godokoro (minister of Go), which was awarded to the strongest player of a generation. Such players were dubbed Meijin (brilliant man), which was considered equal to a 9 dan professional grade. Over the 300-year period covered here, only ten players received the title of Meijin. Several other players (16 total) received the title of Jun-Meijin (half-Meijin), which is considered to equal an 8 dan professional grade and listed as such below. In some houses it was the custom that the head of the house was always named the same according to the iemoto system (家元). All heads of the house Inoue (井上) were named Inseki (因碩), heads of the house Yasui (安井 ) were named Senkaku (仙角) from the 4th head onward, and heads of the house Hayashi (林) were named Monnyu (門入) from the second head onward. To distinguish between these players, the names listed below are the names they had before becoming head of their house, or after their retirement. The house Honinbo (本因坊) had no such tradition, although heads would often take one character from the name of their predecessor into their own name, notably the character Shu (秀) from the 14th head onward.*All ranks are professional dan grades unless otherwise noted.China*Players could achieve the level of Guoshou (literally National Hand), which is best in the nation and ranked 1 pin 品. This title is a derivation of Mencius description of Yi Qiu (弈秋), Qiu the Yi player in 《孟子·告子章句上》: 今夫弈之为数，小数也。不专心致志，则不得也。弈秋，通国之善弈者也。使弈秋诲二人弈，其一人专心致志，惟弈秋之为听；一人虽听之，一心以为有鸿鹄将至，思援弓缴而射之，虽与俱学，弗若之矣！as being '通国之善弈者', literally the finest Yi player of the whole nation. It is considered to be equal to the Japanese title of Meijin.The term Qi Sheng (棋圣) was first mentioned by Ge Hong (葛洪) in 《抱朴子》：“棋之无敌者，则谓之棋圣。” The literal meaning is the Invincible Qi player is called the Saint of Qi (Qi Sheng).Note that both Guoshou and Qisheng were not tournament winner titles; instead they were honorific titles used by Wei Qi players and historians respectively to refer to the best players who were invincible in highest graded tournaments. Guoshou was the normal term used to refer to the promo player while he was alive, whereas Qisheng was used more as posthumous fame.The ranking of players began in West Han Dynasty (2nd century BCE) and formally recognized by the Governments during the North and South Dynasties Period (3rd to 6th century CE). There were 9 ranks called pin 品 in the system, the same as the ranking system for government officials. The lowest rank was 9 pin, then 8 pin, etc. up to 1 pin. The difference of the lower 5 pin was about 1 zi (子, piece or stone), and the difference between the top 4 pin was half zi.20th centuryJapanWomenChinaNote: China formally adopted dan ranking in the early 1980s.

One boat, the May Queen, came downriver passing the Hampstall Ferry, (located between Stourport and Holt Fleet), at speed. The ferryboat lurched and all 17 passengers were tipped into the river. Some witnesses said the ferry was overloaded. Nine people were drowned. 4 February 1939, three tanker barges overturned in the estuary off Sharpness. They were taken with the tide into the piers of the Severn Railway Bridge. Of the eight man crew, six men were killed 3 April 1947, a British ship, the 1,580 ton Stancliffe, went aground off Sharpness loaded with 3,000 tons of timber. Local shipyard engineer, Ivor Langford, managed to cut the vessel in two and sail both parts down to Cardiff Docks. There the two halves were joined together and the ship sailed again under the new name of . 23 March 1951, a large 4,845 ton Egyptian registered shipwas bound for Sharpness loaded with 7,000 tons of maize from Russia when she ran aground on Lydney Sands. Unable to float her off, the cargo had to be unloaded out in the estuary into smaller craft. Eventually she became a total loss. The wreck can be seen occasionally above the mud at low water. 4 February, 1954, a Bristol Britannia G-ALRX prototype plane was forced to land in the River Serven Mudflats with retracted gear. Engine 3 on plane exploded during flight. The plane could not return to Filton and had to make emergency landing. Her crew and passengers escaped harm. The plane was a total lose due to time to recover of 48 hours, salty tidewater covering the fuselage, and stress on fuselage in efforts to pull it to shore.25 October 1960, two loaded tanker barges, the Arkendale H and the Wastdale H were off Sharpness when they came together in thick fog. The tide took them into a pier of the Severn Railway Bridge and two spans came crashing down onto the barges. There was an explosion and of the eight man crew, five were killed. 16 February 1961, the Loss of the : The BP Explorer was loaded and bound for Sharpness from Swansea. As the loaded tanker barge made her way up the Severn Estuary she suddenly turned over. It was not until the following day that the tanker barge was seen bouncing her way, upside down, through the wrecked Severn Railway Bridge. Her crew of five men were killed. The BP Explorer was salvaged and rebuilt as the BP Driver, but on 31 January 1962 she was driven aground at Nash Point; fortunately her crew were saved. 19 November 1961, during construction of the Severn Bridge three men fell into the river. The alarm was raised and a rescue boat crewed by two men set sail from Chepstow. Unknown to the crew of the rescue boat the three men had been picked up safely by the last crossing of the day of one of the Aust to Beachley ferry boats, the Severn Princess. Two tanker barges were coming down empty from Sharpness, the Wyesdale H and the Wharfedale H, tied together and both being steered from the Wyesdale H. The steersman failed to see the rescue boat, as the boat had no navigation lights, and both barges collided with it. One man was saved, but the other crew member of the rescue boat was drowned. 4 September 1990, three men were working in one of the four maintenance gantries attached to the underside of the Severn Bridge, carrying out routine maintenance work. The gantry gave way plunging the three men into the Severn. Mark Seaton (19), a painter, survived thedrop, but Robin Phelps (44) and Eric Sullivan (46) were killed.See also Crossings of the River Severn List of shipwrecks in the Bristol Channel (for shipwrecks downstream of the Severn Bridge) Severn Area Rescue AssociationReferencesRiver Severn Severn Severn Disasters Disasters", "machine_text": " The Severn is one of the longest rivers in the United Kingdom, rising in Wales and flowing through the Midlands, Gloucestershire, Wiltshire and Avon before emptying into the Bristol Channel. Its 447 km (278 mi) long course has been witness to some major disasters in history. This is a list of some of the most notable disasters of the Severn estuary throughout the centuries. 1796: The Severn Rai Wreck - In November of 1796, a large merchant ship carrying supplies to France attempted to cross the Severn in stormy weather, which led to its sinking off the coast of Abbotsbury. The vessel, captained by William Millar, was heavily loaded with valuable cargo and could not be salvaged immediatly. 1907: The RMS Severn Grounding - In March of 1907, a passenger ship carrying around 200 passengers ran aground near Weston Super Mare due to poor visibility and strong winds. The vessel suffered substantial damage and was subsequently declared a total loss. 1944: The Bristol Channel Spitfire Incident - In October 1944, a Spitfire fighter plane piloted by Flight Sergeant William Wilkinson crashed into the Severn estuary near Lavernock Point. The body of the pilot was never found and the cause of the incident remains a mystery. 1961: Chipperfield’s Circus Accident - In November 1961, a troupe of performing elephants from Chipperfield’s Circus were travelling from Bristol to Cardiff on the Severn Ferry when the vessel suffered a mechanical breakdown in a storm. One of the elephants died after being thrown overboard and the others had to be rescued. 1991: Severn Bridge Collapse - In December 1991, an expansion joint in the Severn Bridge collapsed due to a build-up of corrosion, causing huge traffic delays. The bridge was closed for maintenance and was eventually rebuilt at a cost of £125 million. These are just a few of the disasters that have occurred on the Severn throughout the years. Despite its treacherous past, the Severn continues to be an important transport and trade route in the United Kingdom.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 7932170}

This was one of the most prominent cases linking knife crime to Drill music, as it is believed that his death was foreshadowed in a drill music video.BackgroundAspiring architect Jermaine Goupall, 15, was a student at St. Joseph's College and attended Saturday school at Croydon Supplementary Education Project.After an evening with friends at a cinema in the summer holidays, the group were ambushed by masked thugs armed with knives in the Thornton Heath area.Jermaine was stabbed seven times and the fatal wound being to his femoral artery to his right thigh. Despite best efforts from bystanders and emergency services, Jermaine bled to death and was pronounced dead at the scene, Jermaine was less than 100 yards from his home. [NK1]TrialOn 8 January 2018 the trial for Jermaine's murder took place at the Old Bailey. Four out of the five youths were convicted on 14 February 2018, resulting in three of the offenders being sentenced to a total of 72 years for premeditated murder.[1]r.Adam Benzahi, 21, Samuel Oliver-Rowland, 18, Junior Simpson, 17 were found guilty of murder. Saskia Haye-Elliot,18 was found guilty of manslaughter.On the first day of the trial, the court was told by Mukul Chawla QC (Jermaine's Barrister) that Haye-Elliot says she thought they were going to 'annoy or irate' members of the CR7 gang by videoing them for Snapchat and or YouTube. Though Jermaine was not a member of the CR7 gang he sadly was caught by the offenders based on an assumption because he lived in the area. Haye-Elliot and Simpson both accept they were in the Ford Focus car that was driven to the scene on the night of Jermaine's death.During the trial Simpson said he was not aware that anyone was hurt until the three other passengers in the car returned. He also denied knowledge stating he was unaware of any knives, masks or balaclavas being in the car, as the prosecution alleges.The court heard how Simpson has a previous conviction of possessing a knife, in 2015, to which he pleaded guilty.Croydon Advertiser and BBC News reported heavily on Jermaine's case throughout. Croydon Advertiser, spoke to the Goupall family after perpetrators were convicted.Jermaine was unknown to the offenders and during the court trial, all of the offenders stated that they never knew who he was and never had an issue with him.

It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since June 12, 2017.The first settlers arrived in what is now Gaines Basin well before the Erie Canal (or any namesake turning basin thereon) did. Lansing Bailey and his brother Joel built a wooden cabin there in 1812. By 1823, as the Erie Canal was nearing completion, the family had moved on, and the building was being used as a school house.It was not long before a burgeoning population—brought on by the Canal and expanding settlement of Orleans County (which split from Genesee County in 1824)—necessitated a larger structure for educating local children. The new school was built in 1832 of local cobblestone, as was common in the area, on land across the road from the old school building. The new building had 913 square feet of space and continued serving as a school until 1944, when centralization caused Gaines District No. 2 to be consolidated into the Albion Central School District.The building sat unused for decades until efforts to preserve the deteriorating building began in 2014. In 2015, a historical marker was added, and by 2017 restoration efforts had progressed enough to have the property listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Also that year, a donated outhouse was moved to the property. By 2021, the interior had been restored to its 1940s appearance, with the original teacher's desk and authentic decor.Having received the property as a donation, the Orleans County Historical Association (which spearheaded the restoration work) intends to use the building for history programs and gatherings.ReferencesNational Register of Historic Places in Orleans County, New York School buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in New York (state) School buildings completed in 1832", "machine_text": " Gaines District No. 2 Cobblestone Schoolhouse, also known as the Little Red Schoolhouse, is a historic one-room school located at 1163 Weise Road in Gaines, Orleans County, New York.

Males are larger than females, weighing an average of , compared withfor females. They have a typical mouse-like appearance, with short whiskers and stubby claws on the feet. They have dark to golden brown fur over most of their body, with paler greyish or yellowish underparts. Some have a whitish spot between the ears, but this is not present on all individuals.Cursor grass mice are members of the A. cursor species group, and very similar in appearance to other members of the group. In particular, they cannot easily be distinguished from the closely related montane grass mouse, which inhabits neighbouring regions to the immediate south. Although the cursor grass mouse is, on average, slightly larger than the montane species, there is too much overlap for this to be a reliable guide. Instead, they can most readily be distinguished by the presence of a gall bladder in A. cursor (absent in the montane species), by karyotypic analysis, or by means of PCR based techniques.Distribution and habitat The exact geographic range of the cursor grass mouse is disputed. It is definitively known to inhabit eastern Brazil from Paraiba to Paraná, where it lives in patches of tropical Atlantic Forest and restinga scrubland at elevations from sea level to . Some sources also report it as being found further south, in extreme southern Brazil, in eastern Paraguay, and in northern Argentina. These latter sources lack a definitive genetic analysis of the individuals identified, and it has been argued that they may represent members of other species, such as the montane grass mouse. No subspecies are recognised.Biology and behaviour Cursor grass mice are omnivorous. Their primary diet consists of small arthropods, especially Hymenoptera, beetles, and spiders; this is supplemented by seeds of Cecropia and other plants. They search for food through leaf litter and patches of dense vegetation, and are strictly terrestrial. Individuals have a home range of , with the ranges of males being larger than those of females. Although the size of their home ranges does not change, the population density of cursor grass mice becomes significantly higher during the rainy season, when insects are most abundant.Cursor grass mice breed throughout the year, although most births occur during the dry season between June and September. Pregnant females construct globular nests, and give birth to a litter of two to nine young, with an average of four, after a gestation period of 23 days.This species is particularly important for public health since it has been implied as a Hantavirus reservoir.A cell line derived from a liposarcoma in a cursor grass mouse has been used by biomedical scientists in the construction of a panel for the identification of human chromosomes in hybrid cells.ReferencesAkodon Mammals described in 1888 Taxa named by Herluf Winge", "machine_text": " The cursor grass mouse (Microtus Cursor) is a species of vole found primarily in the grasslands of North America. It is a medium-sized mouse, measuring about 4-4.5 inches long. The body is stout, with large ears, strong claws and a long tail, which is used for balance. The fur of the cursor grass mouse is usually brown or black on the sides and has white patches on the back, cheeks and throat. The winter coat is much thicker with longer and softer fur. The eyes are small and black, with a large nose. The tail is thin and has white stripes. The cursor grass mouse is nocturnal and lives in a burrow that it dig in grasslands, fields and pastures. They are omnivorous, consuming the seeds and bulbs of grasses, as well as some fruits, invertebrates, small amphibians and occasionally small mammals. A single pair of cursor grass mice typically claims a territory of approximately 1000 square feet, which they will defend against other mice. Breeding takes place in the spring and summer, with litters of up to four young. The primary threat to the survival of this species is the loss of its natural habitat due to human activities, such as deforestation and urbanization. They are also preyed upon by several species of snake, fox and hawk. The cursor grass mouse is listed as threatened in some areas, and is a species of special concern in its native range. It can be found in protected areas, such as national parks, but due to the decline in numbers, it is listed as a vulnerable species by the IUCN. Despite these challenges, the cursor grass mouse remains a well-known fixture of the North American grasslands, due to its docile nature and wide distribution. As such, it is a common choice for students of biology and ecology, who use it to learn more about small mammal habitat requirements.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 6894073}

In 1880 the parish built a larger church on High Street, towards East Dedham. The laying of the cornerstone for this 'cathedral in the wilderness' attracted more than 4,000 people, and special trains were run from Boston and Norwood. The new church would not be completed until 1900, and was dedicated by Archbishop Sebastiano Martinelli, the papal delegate. Today the church hosts one of the largest Life Teen programs in the country.HistoryEarly history The history of Catholicism in Dedham begins in 1758, only 120 years after the settlement of the Contentment Plantation and fully two decades before the American Revolution. During the French and Indian War the British expelled over 11,000 Acadians from what is today Nova Scotia.Eleven of them resettled in Dedham, and though the town and the Massachusetts Bay colony were both officially Congregationalist, they were allowed to reside here as French neutrals until they returned to Canada in 1760.After the Acadians returned to Canada in 1760, Dedham would not see another Catholic resident for decades. The first Catholic who spent any length of time in Dedham was Mr. Gill, who lived in what is today known as Riverdale, but was then called Dedham Island. The few Catholics who lived in Dedham would have to travel 16 miles to St. Joseph's in Roxbury, the Cathedral of the Holy Cross on Franklin Street in Boston, or to St. Mary's in Waltham to attend Mass.By the early 1800s a few Catholics had settled in Dedham. The first Mass in Dedham was celebrated in Sunday, May 15, 1843, in the home of Daniel Slattery, with eight Catholics present. An altar was set up by the window. For the next three years Slattery's 17-year-old brother-in-law would bring Father James Strain from Waltham and back each Sunday to minister to the needs of the small congregation.By 1846, the Catholic community in Dedham was well established enough that the town became part of the mission of St. Joseph's Church in Roxbury. The flood of Irish immigrants escaping the Great Famine necessitated holding Mass in the Temperance Hall, often by Father Patrick O'Beirne. Mass was also occasionally celebrated in the Crystal Palace on Washington Street. Worshipers came from Dedham, South Dedham, West Dedham, and West Roxbury.First ChurchThe number and devotion of the first parishioners permitted a church to be constructed within 10 years. In 1856 the cornerstone was laid and, in 1857, the first St. Mary's Church was completed on Washington Street between Spruce and Marion Streets. On Easter Sunday, April 12, 1857, Father O'Beirne said Mass for the first time in a new church that could seat 600.During the 1880s, Father Johnson was publicly raising the issue of discrimination against Catholics in the public schools. In 1885, as a member of the School Committee, he claimed the principal of the Avery School ridiculed Catholic students, and several years later had a lengthy debate with a Protestant minister via letters in the Dedham Standard about the 'rank misrepresentation of the Catholic Church' in a history book adopted by the School Committee.In 1890 there were an estimated 2,000 parishioners, including 957 Irish, 250 English-speaking Canadians, 58 French, 19 Italians and 1 Portuguese. There were 400 students in the Sunday School classes in 1884.Church construction In February 1880, it was announced that a Protestant who had business in Boston had paid off the parish's 700 debt, allowing the congregation to commence work on a new building. The cornerstone of the present church was laid at 3:00 on October 17, 1880 by Archbishop John Williams. A crowd of between 4,000 and 5,000 people attended, and special trains were run from Boston and Norwood to accommodate all those who wished to attend. It was one of the largest gatherings in Dedham's history.The footprint of the Gothic church, which Father Johnson said was to be a 'cathedral in the wilderness,' measures 150' long by 65' wide, and the bell tower is 164' tall. The apex of the ceiling is 80' and it has the longest aisle in the Archdiocese of Boston. It was at the time, and remains today, 'the largest and most imposing church in the town' and 'one of the most conspicuous edifices' in the town.The interior walls were plastered by William B. Gould, an escaped slave who settled in Dedham. While the upper church was still under construction, the lower church was used for Mass and the upper portion for various fairs and other gatherings. The first mass was said in the lower church on October 24, 1886. The crowd was overflowing, and included 20 Protestants, many of local importance, and a choir from St. Peter's in South Boston.After 20 years of working, praying, and fundraising from the meager immigrant wages of many of the parishioners, the Upper Church was finally completed. It took so long that another architect had to take over but was, Father Fleming said, “almost too beautiful for ordinary use.”The upper church was completed and dedicated by Archbishop Williams on September 9, 1900. In addition to Williams, Archbishop Sebastiano Martinelli, the papal delegate to the United States, attended, as did Bishop Denis Mary Bradley of New Hampshire. The crowd, numbered at 1,200, included the communion class and many prominent citizens of the Town, including Protestants. The dedication packed the church, requiring many to stand, and tickets were required to enter.Albert Nickerson, a member of Dedham's St. Paul's Episcopal Church, donated10,000 towards the effort. The Dedham Granite for the outer walls was donated by another Protestant, John Bullard. The granite came from Bullard's own lot.20th century In June 1890, Father John H. Fleming arrived at St. Mary's and began a 33-year tenure as pastor. During his pastorate the parish the upper church would be completed, the parish cemetery in West Roxbury would be purchased, and the old wooden rectory next to the church would be torn down so a new rectory could be built of Dedham Granite in 1913. On Sundays, however, the quality of his preaching was such that other priests would come to St. Mary's to listen.In the 1920s, with the building work completed, new pastor Father Henry A. Walsh was able to focus on the various groups and societies within the parish. The Catholic population in the area grew, as did the amount of social activity within the parish. By 1936, the parish was one of the largest in the Archdiocese of Boston with 6,000 parishioners, four priests, and six nuns. The Sunday School alone had over 1,300 pupils. Within months of arriving as pastor in 1929, Father George P. O'Connor began a parish school with three Sisters of St. Joseph. He also began a Catholic Youth Organization, and was generally regarded as having a focus on youth.Modern history In the 1960s, St. Mary's remained one of the largest parishes in the archdiocese. As it was too much work for one pastor and three assistant priests, a second parish was established for the Riverdale neighborhood, St. Susana's, in 1962. As the school was also growing, a new convent was constructed in 1964.The number of people attending Mass each week began to drop off rather dramatically in the early 1990s. In 1989, the average weekly attendance was 2,843 people. By 1995, however, it dropped to just 1,030. The following year, 1996, Father (later bishop) John Anthony Dooher and Father Chris Hickey arrived at St. Mary's within weeks of each other. Mass attendance increased by 50", "machine_text": " St. Mary's Church is a historic Episcopal Church located in the city of Dedham, Massachusetts. It is owned and operated by the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts. History St. Mary's Church was founded in 1760 as a Congregational Church by members of Dedham's Old South Congregational Church. Early records indicate that the church was initially known as the Blue Church and held services downstairs in a brick meetinghouse. In 1820 the church was reorganized and converted to the Episcopal faith. It was then renamed St. Mary's Church, in honor of its patron saint, the Blessed Virgin Mary. At this time, the congregation moved upstairs to the main sanctuary and its name was changed. St. Mary's is considered by many to be one of the oldest Congregational churches in the state, founded seven years before the American Revolution. The church has seen a number of renovations and upgrades over the years, including the addition of a gothic-style facade, a bell tower, and a parish hall in 1912. Architecture St. Mary's is a Gothic-style building, constructed of brick and bluestone. The bell tower is located at the front of the building and is topped with a copper spire. A gothic rose window is at the center of the facade. Inside, the sanctuary features a high ceiling, exposed beams, and stained glass windows. Today St. Mary's continues to serve the local community through outreach and worship. Its services are attended by members of all denominations, and its doors are open to everyone. Services are held every Sunday, as well as weekly weekday services and special events. St. Mary's is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and has been listed since 2002.

It took a Left Republican position, although it was never an official socialist organ.In the years before World War I (1914–18) many prominent politicians contributed to the paper. The paper opposed the pact between Germany and Russia just before World War II (1939–45), and after the fall of France opposed the Vichy regime. However, it managed to continue publication until 1944.HistoryLe Petit Provençal was founded in Marseille in 1880, and distributed in south eastern France. It was originally titled La Jeune république (The Young Republic). The founder was Geoffroy Velten (1831–1915), also called Godfried Velten, a Protestant entrepreneur and militant Republican who became a Municipal Councillor in Marseilles in 1880, and on 25 January 1883 was made Senator for Bouches-du-Rhône. Velten also founded L'Égalité. The paper competed with others such as Le Petit Marseillais, Le Radical and Le Soleil du Midi. At first the newspaper published opinions and polemics, but later it became a source of news and information. Thus, during the campaign in Madagascar, from September 1894 to December 1896 Le Petit Provençal devoted 95 editorials or feature articles on the front page to colonial issues.Le Petit Provençal paper called itself a Socialist Republican newspaper, but was never the official organ of the socialists. Between 1890 and 1900 it supported socialist candidates of all camps, including Guesdists. Regular contributors included Alexandre Millerand, René Viviani, Gustave Rouanet, Clovis Hugues and Léon Mirman. André Joseph Lefèvre wrote for Le Petit Provençal in the period before World War I (1914–18). During the period leading up to 1914 the paper emphasized that it supported both radicals and socialists. The circulation was 40,000–50,000 in 1902. While papers at the time usually gave false circulation figuresLe Petit Provençal by 1913 probably had a daily circulation of about 100,000.

It is one of the oldest newspapers in France and is the official newspaper of the Var region. The newspaper is primarily distributed in the Var and Bouches-du-Rhône departments. The publication was founded by Auguste Théodore Gombert and Fabien Gombert. They first published it under the title La Provence on March 2, 1880 in Toulon. They ran the paper from a store near the Toulon harbor and the newspaper primarily focused on regional news as well as business content. The newspaper was previously 7 pages and by the 1950s and 1960s, it had expanded up to 50 pages. In the 1920s and 1930s, the newspaper was known for its anti-Semitic stance. However, during the 1940s and 1950s, the paper shifted focus to become pro-democracy and the paper was used to promote the perception of the Union for the New Republic, a center-right political party. In 1984, the newspaper underwent a name change and became La Provençal which was then changed to Le Petit Provençal in 1993. Currently, it is owned by the Group Hersant Media and has an estimated circulation of 106,000 copies reaching 550,000 readers. The newspaper typically focuses on local culture, sports, and continental European politics.

He was employed as an architect to the London County Council, where he oversaw the construction of a number of public buildings including Montagu House, now the Library of the University of London, and Holloway Sanatorium. From 1895 to 1898, Otter-Barry was Engineering Surveyor for Westminster Abbey, where he developed a close relationship with the Dean, Rev. Arthur Richard Everard, who requested he be engaged in the long-term restoration of Westminster Hall. In 1900, Otter-Barry was appointed surveyor to Westminster Hall, a post he held until 1923. During this time, Otter-Barry was responsible for a wide range of restoration and conservation work, including the restoration of its thirteenth-century hammer beam roof. He also supervised the construction of a new clock chamber and helped to install the eleven-ton turret clock, known as 'Big Ben', at the north-west corner of Westminster Hall in 1912. In addition to his restoration work in Westminster, Otter-Barry undertook repair and conservation projects at other important London buildings, including Tower of London (1908-1910) and Whitehall Palace (1911-12). He also carried out extensive work across Britain, including at the Chapter House at Ripon Cathedral (1909-11) and Wycombe Parish Church in Buckinghamshire (1914-15). Otter-Barry was a lifelong conservationist, writing on the need for the protection of our ancient buildings and monuments, and was one of the first to champion the use of photogrammetry for the accurate mapping of sites and structures from photographs. He was also an active member of the Royal Society of Antiquaries and was awarded the society's Medal of Service for recording ancient and historical sites for posterity. Hugh Otter-Barry died in 1925 and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Dihu\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The dihu (低胡, pinyin: dīhú) is a large bowed string instrument from China. It has a large soundbox covered on one end with snakeskin. Like most other members of the huqin family of instruments, it has two strings and is held vertically. The instrument's name derives from 'dī,' meaning 'low,' and 'hú' (short for huqin).Sizes The instrument comes in three sizes: The xiaodihu (小低胡, also called dahu or cizhonghu), pitched one octave below the erhu (tuned D-A, with its lowest D one whole step above the viola's lowest C). It is the tenor member of the erhu family (the erhu being the soprano member and the zhonghu being the alto member). The zhongdihu (中低胡, pitched one octave below the zhonghu, (tuned G-D, as the middle strings of the cello). It is the bass member of the erhu family. The dadihu (大低胡, pitched one octave below the xiaodihu and two octaves below the erhu (tuned D-A, with its lowest D one whole step above the cello's lowest C). It is the contrabass member of the erhu family.Overview The dihu family was developed for orchestral use in the 1930s as lower members of the erhu family (the erhu being the soprano member and the zhonghu being the alto member) to increase the pitch range of the instruments used in a Chinese orchestra and allow music with harmony to be played.However, by the late 20th century it had largely fallen into disuse, part of the reason being that it is unwieldy to play. Also, the fact that (like other instruments in the huqin family) the bow passes between the instrument's two strings means that playing pizzicato is difficult; thus, the larger four-string gehu and diyingehu (or cello or double bass) are generally used in Chinese orchestras for the lower bowed string voices instead.See also Dahu (instrument) Diyingehu Laruan Huqin Traditional Chinese musical instrumentsReferencesExternal links Dihu page (Chinese) Xiaodihu photo (xiaodihu on left; erhu on right for comparison) Zhongdihu photo (zhongdihu on left; erhu on right for comparison) Dadihu photo (dadihu on left; erhu on right for comparison)Bowed instruments Chinese musical instruments Drumhead lutes Huqin family instruments", "machine_text": " Dihu (Chinese: 滴湖; pinyin: dī hú) is a town in Yunnan Province, Southwest China.

Her work was widely anthologized and translated into various languages, including Italian, Japanese and Finnish.BiographyShe was born in the Peak District, Derbyshire, in 1936, and attended the University of Bristol where she received her BA in French. She then moved to Australia for ten years, where she was a Tutor in French at the University of Queensland while studying for her M.A. and Ph.D., both on French Surrealism. In 1971 she returned to the UK, and settled in Helston, Cornwall, in 1974, where she undertook tutoring in Twentieth-Century Poetry for the Open University and for the University of Exeter Extra-Mural programme, while writing and publishing her major works of poetry. She was appointed as Cornwall's first Writer in the Community in 1986, and was regularly invited to give Poetry Workshops and courses at the Arvon Foundation. She received an honorary Doctor of Letters from the University of Exeter in recognition of her literary achievements in 1989, and many of her literary papers are held in the University of Exeter archive. She lived on her own in Helston from 1990 until her death.WorkHer first work, TimeMotion (1975) was published in Australia under the name 'Sylvia Kantarizis', and her poetry is sometimes republished under that name in anthologies of Australian poetry. However, most of her work was published in Britain, and some of her poetry has a specifically Cornish theme. Her second major book, The Tenth Muse (1983) explores the relationship of women to writing, and 'through its title, evokes a whole tradition of women's poetry'. Shortly after its publication, she was involved in a lively feminist debate in the Letters pages of The Times Literary Supplement concerning a fictional 'Hysterical Women's Movement' that many contemporary reviewers of women's writing appeared to believe in. Her next collection, The Sea at the Door (1985) is described by one reviewer as 'a haunted book – haunted by past and present selves, none of them quite real', noting particularly the way in which she often engages intense erotic themes through the filter of imagination and dreams. Some of her work focuses on fraught relationships between men and women, together with an exploration of gender politics, notably News from the Front (1983), co-authored with the poet and novelist D. M. Thomas, in which each poet explores the conflictive relationship between a young Portuguese radical and a right-wing British businessman, with each sometimes adopting the feminine and sometimes the masculine persona. The Air Mines of Mistila (1988), written in collaboration with the poet Philip Gross, has a Latin American theme, with allusions to the novel Pedro Páramo by Juan Rulfo in a number of the poems. This collection won the Poetry Book Society Choice of 1988. Her next published book, Dirty Washing (1989) contains selected poems drawn from four previous books together with several new poems. Her penultimate book, Lad's Love (1993), is a collection of love poetry, exploring the relationship between an older woman and a younger man.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Moravian University\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Moravian University is a private university in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The college traces its founding to 1742 by Moravians, descendants of followers of the Bohemian Reformation (John Amos Comenius), and claims to be the sixth-oldest college in the United States.History Moravian University is the sixth-oldest college in the United States and the first to open its doors to women. The college traces its roots to the Bethlehem Female Seminary, which was founded in 1742, as the first boarding school for young women in the U.S. The seminary was created by Benigna, Countess von Zinzendorf, the daughter of Count Nikolaus Ludwig Zinzendorf, who was the benefactor of the fledgling Moravian communities in Nazareth and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The Female Seminary was incorporated by the Pennsylvania State Legislature in 1863 and became the women's college, the Moravian Seminary and College for Women in 1913.The university also traces its roots to the founding of two boys' schools, established in 1742 and 1743, which merged to become Nazareth Hall in 1759. Located in the town of Nazareth, Nazareth Hall became, in part, Moravian College and Theological Seminary in 1807. It was later incorporated by the Pennsylvania State Legislature as Moravian College and Theological Seminary in 1863 as a baccalaureate-granting institution. Beginning in 1858 and continuing to 1892, the seminary and college relocated from Nazareth to a former boys' school on Church Street in Bethlehem, located on the present site of the Bethlehem City Hall.The men's Moravian College and Theological Seminary then settled in the north end of the city (the present-day North Campus) as a result of a donation from the Bethlehem Congregation of the Moravian Church in 1888. The first buildings constructed at North Campus, Comenius Hall and Zinzendorf Hall, were completed in 1892 and joined the property's original brick farmhouse to form the new campus. The farmhouse was later named Hamilton Hall, which still stands today.In 1954, the two schools combined to form the single, coeducational, modern institution of Moravian College. The merger of the two institutions combined the North Campus (the location of the men's college from 1892 to 1954) and the South Campus (the location of the women's college) into a single collegiate campus. The distance between the North and South campuses is about 0.8 miles of Main Street, called the 'Moravian Mile'. First-year students traditionally walk the Moravian Mile as part of their orientation activities.In 2021, Moravian College received approval from the Pennsylvania Department of Education to become a university. The change to Moravian University became official on July 1, 2021.AcademicsMoravian University currently enrolls about 1,700 full-time undergraduate students in a wide variety of majors, all of which are presented in the liberal arts tradition. The seminary enrolls over 100 full-time students in its graduate divinity programs. During most semesters, at least 14 denominations are represented in the seminary student body. Faith communities most often represented among the seminary's students include: Moravian, Lutheran, UCC, Episcopal, United Methodist, Presbyterian, Baptist, Roman Catholic, Quaker, Mennonite, Unitarian Universalist, African Methodist Episcopal, Assembly of God, Brethren, Reformed, and nondenominational. The college's varied and highly regarded music programs grow from the Moravian Church's musical traditions.Moravian University's student news site is The Comenian, which is published online throughout the school year.Every year, the student body elects representatives to the United Student Government. USG has a legislature, composed of 16 senators from the undergraduate body, an executive, including an elected president and vice president, appointed cabinet and staff, and a judiciary, composed of appointed justices. USG was officially recognized in 1968. Additionally, two students are elected members of Moravian University's board of trustees; both are full, voting members and serve two-year terms.Moravian University awards these undergraduate and graduate degrees: Bachelor of Music, Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Fine Arts, Bachelor of Science in Nursing, Bachelor of Science, Master of Business Administration, Master of Education, Master of Human Resource Management, Master of Arts in Clinical Counseling, and six Master of Science programs in nursing; the seminary grants Master of Divinity and Master of Arts in Theological Studies degrees. The university also has evening undergraduate programs for adults seeking continuing undergraduate education and graduate degrees. The seminary has accreditation from the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada.Because Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and Tondabayashi, Japan, have been sister cities for over half a century, Moravian University and Osaka Ohtani University (大阪大谷大学) also established a partnership. Each spring, several Japanese students come to Moravian for two weeks to take a class about the American education system. These students are hosted by Moravian students and enjoy trips to New York City and Philadelphia. During May and June 2010, the first two Moravian students studied at Osaka Ohtani University. Additionally, the college is a member of the Lehigh Valley Association of Independent Colleges; members include Muhlenberg College, Lafayette College, Lehigh University, Cedar Crest College, and DeSales University; students from each institution can take classes in each other member institution and can take courses in programs offered at other institutions not offered at Moravian, such as architecture.The university's Student Opportunities for Academic Research (SOAR) program provides stipends, travel allowances, and expenses for students engaged in research or creative activities through close interaction with a faculty mentor. The program helps Moravian students gain a better understanding of scholarship in their discipline, and fosters scholar–colleague relationships. SOAR stipends can be as high as 3,000 for summer work.Established in 1960, the university's honors program provides qualified seniors the opportunity to pursue a yearlong intensive study of a subject of special interest.Campus The university's programs are offered at four locations: Main Street Campus (North Campus), the Priscilla Payne Hurd Campus (South Campus), the Steel Field Complex, and the Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation Center.Priscilla Payne Hurd Campus Art and music programs are offered in Bethlehem's historic district on the college's Priscilla Payne Hurd Campus. Many of the buildings on that campus were built during the colonial period, including the Brethren's House, built in 1748, which served as a hospital during the Revolutionary War, and currently houses the Music Department. Also located on Priscilla Payne Campus are the President's House, Main Hall (1854), the Widow's House, Clewell Hall, West Hall, South Hall, the 1867 Chapel, Clewell Dining Hall, and the Central Moravian Church. A number of the buildings are connected. The facilities have been renovated to include Payne Gallery (renovated from the original women's gymnasium in 1903), the college's two-level art gallery that offers several shows each year, and Foy Concert Hall. Also located on the Priscilla Payne Hurd Campus are Peter Hall, a medium-sized recital hall, Hearst Hall, a small recital hall, and individual student rehearsal rooms and art studios. The university presents the nationally renowned Christmas Vespers services in the Central Moravian Church, located on the corner of Main and Church streets across from Brethren's House. Many of the buildings on the Priscilla Payne Hurd Campus are located in a National Register of Historic Places District and Church Street has been referred to as one of the most historic streets in America.In the 2009–2010 school year, Moravian University added a new living complex on the Priscilla Payne Hurd Campus called the HILL. Each floor has suites, where four to 16 people can live. The complex has classrooms, a cafe, a fitness room, a mail room, and common rooms. The HILL is air conditioned and fully handicap accessible. The suites contain a living room, full kitchen, private bathroom, and additional hallway sinks. A shuttle service is provided for easy transportation between the North and South campuses.Main Street Campus Initially given in 1888 and settled in 1892, the North Campus is also known as the Main Street campus, as it is physically larger and is the site of the majority of the university's buildings, academic departments, administration, and student residences. The main building of the Main Street Campus is Comenius Hall, which was built in 1892 and is named for John Amos Comenius, the last bishop of Unity of the Brethren, known as the 'father of modern education' for his revolutionary educational principles. Comenius wrote in 1632, 'not the children of the rich or of the powerful only, but of all alike, boys and girls, both noble and ignoble, rich and poor, in all cities and towns, villages and hamlets, should be sent to school'. The Moravians had considered schools secondary in importance only to churches. A statue of Comenius, which was a gift to the college from Charles University of Prague and the Moravian Church of Czechoslovakia, stands in front of Comenius Hall. The Main Street Campus is also the location of Reeves Library, Priscilla Payne Hurd Academic Complex, Colonial Hall, the Bahnson Center, the Moravian Archives, Zinzendorf Hall, Borhek Chapel, Prosser Auditorium (capacity 300), Monacacy Hall, Collier Hall of Science, Hamilton Hall, Memorial Hall, Johnston Hall (capacity 1,600 for athletics, 3,000 for events), the Timothy M. Breidegam Athletic and Recreation Center, the Collier Hall of Science, the Haupert Union Building, the Arena Theatre, and most of the college's student housing, including dorms, townhouses, and apartments.In 2016, John Makuvek Field was installed and opened behind the Haupert Union Building. John Makuvek Field is a synthetic-turf field that is home to the Greyhounds' field hockey, men's and women's lacrosse, and men's and women's soccer teams. The field is named for John Makuvek, who retired in 1996 after four years as athletics director, and in 2010 after 43 years as head golf coach. The field is located at the center of campus, with views from the residential halls, Reeves Library, and the portico of the Haupert Union Building.In 2017, the Sally Breidegam Miksiewicz Center for Health Sciences was opened at 1107 Main Street. The 55,000-square-foot facility hosts classes for both undergraduate and graduate programs, including nursing, informatics, and the health sciences and features the region's only virtual cadaver lab. The building is named in honor of former Moravian College trustee Sally Breidegam Miksiewicz.Also located on the Main Street Campus is the Betty Prince field hockey field.Steel Field ComplexMost of the university's athletic fields are located at this complex, including the football stadium with a grandstand capacity of 2,400 and Sportexe turf field, eight-lane Mondo Super X Performance synthetic track, the softball field, the Gillespie baseball field, the Hoffman tennis courts, the football practice fields, and a fieldhouse.Steel Field and its brick grandstand were originally built by Bethlehem Steel to host the Bethlehem Steel Football Club, 1913 to 1930. In 1925, Lehigh University purchased Steel Field from Bethlehem Steel. The Bethlehem Steel Soccer Club continued to use the field until its demise. In 1962, Lehigh sold the facility to Moravian University.Athletics The university is a member of the NCAA and competes in Division III sports. It is also an associate member of the Centennial Conference for football only; Centennial football members include Muhlenberg College, Dickinson College, FranklinMarshall, Johns Hopkins University, Juniata College, Gettysburg College, Ursinus College, and McDaniel College.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Route 40 (MTA Maryland)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Route 40 is a limited stop bus route, identified as a 'QuickBus', operated by the Maryland Transit Administration in Baltimore and its suburbs. The line currently runs from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in Woodlawn to Middle River, both in Baltimore County, Maryland (on opposite sides) with selected trips terminating at Downtown Baltimore City Hall, passing through the west and east sides and the downtown area of Baltimore City. Service operates every 12 minutes during rush hour, and every 15 minutes at most other times during its hours of operation. The line serves the corridors of Edmondson Avenue in West Baltimore, including the communities of Edmondson Village, Allendale, and Rosemont, and Fayette Street and Eastern Avenue in East Baltimore, serving Patterson Park, Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center and Essex.Unlike a local bus, the 40 does not stop at every bus stop along its route. Rather, its stops are limited to certain locations of importance, including transfer points to other bus lines, major landmarks, and other busy intersections selected by MTA. In all, there are 32 stops along the route in each direction, which are all identified in printed timetables.History The Route 40 started operating on October 23, 2005 as part of the Greater Baltimore Bus Initiative, a plan of then-governor Robert L. Ehrlich for streamlining and simplifying the Baltimore transit system. Unlike a rail line, this addition did not require any construction. The bus route was intended to resemble the proposed Red Line that is currently being studied for the Baltimore region.When it started operating, Route 40 ran from Security Square Mall to the Essex Park-and-Ride lot on Eastern Avenue. Weekday service operated every 10 minutes during rush hour and midday. On February 5 the following year, it was extended to Middle River and reduced to one bus every 12–15 minutes.On June 10, 2007, the eastern layover was moved to a safer location at Old Eastern and Vincent Avenues. The western layover was moved to CMS on February 8, 2009 and the stop at Security Square Mall was moved from the parking lot of the mall to a point along Security Boulevard adjacent to the mall lot.Quickbus 40 PLUS Service Enhanced service for West Baltimore residents on the QuickBus 40 will begin October 25th, 2015.The enhanced service will increase frequency and reliability on the line between the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid in Baltimore County and City Hall in Baltimore City.Customer will find additional bus trips added on west side between CMS and City Hall to enhance off-peak and weekend access to jobs.CriticismRoute 40 received a lot of criticism following its inauguration from riders, politicians, and the media. This criticism resulted in some changes being made to the route, schedule, and other details.The service, which was projected to have a daily ridership level of 27,000, fell far short of that goal. Many riders waiting for other buses at common stops complained about seeing a lot of empty Route 40 buses. This resulted in its weekday frequency being reduced.Low ridership and unrealistic time allocation initially being built into the schedule resulted in poor on-time performance and buses clumping together. As one bus fell behind schedule while busy picking up passengers, the one behind it got ahead after stops had been cleared of waiting passengers, and ultimately caught up to the earlier bus. This left larger gaps between buses.Financial resources needed in order to operate this service were obtained by cutting back on the amount of local bus service along common streets of operation, mostly on Route 23, which had its level of service cut by nearly 50", "machine_text": " Route 40 is a bus route operated by the Maryland Transit Administration (MTA) in the northern Baltimore metropolitan area and Central Maryland. It is the longest bus route in the state and serves a total of 17 stops east and west of the city and through the city of Baltimore itself. Route 40 is a cross-town corridor that provides access to a variety of destinations, including Charm City Circulator's Downtown Service, Penn Station, Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, UMBC, Towson Town Center, White Marsh Mall, and numerous other business, educational and recreational sites. The route originates in the Glen Oaks/Hillen area in eastern Baltimore County, and travels along Hillen Road to 33rd Street. It continues along 33rd Street, through Charles Village and past Johns Hopkins University and University of Maryland, Baltimore. The route makes a few stops along North Avenue and takes Western Avenue to Druid Hill Park and to the Pennsylvania Station Light Rail stop. From here the route travels along North Charles Street, through Charles Center, and the Inner Harbor. It eventually turns onto Pratt Street to Pennington Avenue and the Mondawmin Transit Center before eventually ending at the Liberty Heights Shopping Center. Route 40 operates seven days a week, with service throughout the day, including limited weekend service. The route is wheelchair accessible and provides travelers with free transfers to other local bus routes. Route 40 is one of the primary east-west corridors in the city, and provides a important connection between employment and educational centers, transit hubs, and commercial destinations. The route is heavily used by commuters, students, and recreational riders alike, and is integral in helping to reduce car trips and alleviating traffic congestion.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Calcium channel blocker toxicity\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Calcium channel blocker toxicity is the taking of too much of the medications known as calcium channel blockers (CCBs), either by accident or on purpose. This often causes a slow heart rate and low blood pressure. This can progress to the heart stopping altogether. Some CCBs can also cause a fast heart rate as a result of the low blood pressure. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, sleepiness, and shortness of breath. Symptoms usually occur in the first six hours but with some forms of the medication may not start until 24 after hours.There are a number of treatments that may be useful. These include efforts to reduce absorption of the drug including: activated charcoal taken by mouth if given shortly after the ingestion or whole bowel irrigation if an extended release formula was taken. Efforts to bring about vomiting are not recommended. Medications to treat the toxic effects include: intravenous fluids, calcium gluconate, glucagon, high dose insulin, vasopressors and lipid emulsion. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may also be an option.More than ten thousand cases of calcium channel blocker toxicity were reported in the United States in 2010. Along with beta blockers and digoxin calcium channel blockers have one of the highest rates of death in overdose. These medications first became available in the 1970s and 1980s. They are one of the few types of medication in which one pill can result in the death of a child.Signs and symptoms Most people who have taken too much of a calcium channel blocker, especially diltiazem, get slow heart rate and low blood pressure (vasodilatory shock). This can progress to the heart stopping altogether. CCBs of the dihydropyridine group, as well as flunarizine, predominantly cause reflex tachycardia as a reaction to the low blood pressure.Other potential symptoms include: nausea and vomiting, a decreased level of consciousness, and breathing difficulties. Symptoms usually begin within 6 hours of taking the medication by mouth. With extended release formulations symptoms may not occur for up to a day. Seizures are rare in adults but in children occur more often. Hypocalcaemia may also occur.Cause Calcium channel blockers, also known as calcium channel antagonists, are widely used for a number of health conditions. Thus they are commonly present in many people's homes. In young children one pill may cause serious health problems and potentially death. The calcium channel blocker that caused the greatest number of deaths in 2010 in the United States was verapamil. This agent is believed to cause more heart problems than many of the others.Diagnosis A blood or urine test to diagnose overdose is not generally available. CCB overdose may cause high blood sugar levels, and this is often a sign of how severe the problem will become.Electrocardiogram CCB toxicity can cause a number of electrocardiogram abnormalities with a low sinus rhythm being the most common. Others include: QT prolongation, bundle branch block, first-degree atrioventricular block, and even sinus tachycardia.Differential It may not be possible to tell the difference between beta blocker toxicity and calcium channel blocker overdose based on signs and symptoms.Management The medical management of CCB toxicity may be difficult. It may not improve with the usual treatments used for a low blood pressure and a slow heart rate. In those who have no symptoms or signs six hours following taking an immediate release formulation and 24 hours after taking an extended release formulation need no further medical treatment.Detoxification Activated charcoal is recommended if it can be given within an hour or two of taking the calcium channel blockers. In those who have taken an extended release formulation of a CCB but are otherwise doing fine, whole bowel irrigation with polyethylene glycol may be useful. Causing vomiting by the use of medications such as ipecac is not recommended.Insulin High doses of intravenous insulin with glucose may be useful and are a first line treatment in overdoses. As this treatment may cause a drop in blood sugar and blood potassium levels, these should be monitored closely.OtherIntravenous calcium gluconate or calcium chloride is considered a specific antidotes. Slow heart rate can be treated with atropine and sympathomimetics. Low blood pressure is treated with vasopressors such as adrenaline.There is tentative clinical evidence and good theoretical evidence of the benefit of lipid emulsion in severe overdoses of CCBs. Methylene blue may also be used for those with low blood pressure that does not respond to other treatments.Epidemiology More than 10,000 cases of potential calcium channel blocker toxicity occurred in the United States in 2010. When death occurs in medicine overdose, heart medications are the cause more than 10", "machine_text": " Calcium channel blocker toxicity is an adverse effect of excessive doses of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) on the body. It primarily affects the heart and can lead to serious heart arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest. Other organ systems may also be affected, such as those that regulate blood pressure and bone metabolism. CCB toxicity can be caused by overdose, accidental ingestion, or in some cases due to interactions with other medications. Treatment of CCB toxicity ranges from supportive care to dialysis and the use of antidotes. CCBs are a family of widely used cardiovascular drugs that relax arterial smooth muscle by blocking the influx of calcium, thereby decreasing peripheral vascular resistance and blood pressure. Commonly used CCBs include nifedipine, amlodipine, and diltiazem. These medications are used in a variety of conditions to control high blood pressure, angina, and cardiac arrhythmias. CCB toxicity occurs when an excess of the drug causes an accumulation of calcium in the smooth muscle of the blood vessels and heart. This accumulation can lead to a number of cardiac events, such as arrhythmias, ventricular tachycardia, heart block, and cardiac arrest. It can also cause hypotension, bradycardia, and peripheral vasoconstriction. In other organ systems, symptoms can include hypercalcemia, hypocalcemia, increased intracranial pressure, and skeletal muscle weakness. Patients with CCB toxicity typically present with at least one of the above symptoms. Diagnosis is based on history and physical examination, with electrocardiogram and laboratory tests used to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment depends on the severity of the toxicity and may include supportive care such as intravenous fluids, antiarrhythmic medications, and dialysis. Specific antidotes for CCB toxicity include glucagon, calcium gluconate, and magnesium sulfate. In conclusion, calcium channel blocker toxicity is an adverse effect of excessive doses of CCBs on the body, primarily affecting the heart and potentially leading to serious cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest. Treatment of CCB toxicity ranges from supportive care to dialysis and the use of antidotes. Patients presenting with suspected toxicity should be evaluated promptly and treated accordingly.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 42705237}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Petition to the King\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Petition to the King was a petition sent to King George III by the First Continental Congress in 1774, calling for repeal of the Intolerable Acts.Political background Following the end of the French and Indian War (the North American theater of the Seven Years' War) in 1763, relations between the colonies and Britain had been deteriorating. Because the war had plunged the British government deep into debt, Parliament enacted a series of measures to increase tax revenue from the colonies. These acts, such as the Stamp Act of 1765 and the Townshend Acts of 1767, were seen as legitimate means of collecting revenues to pay off the nearly two-fold increase in British debt stemming from the war.Many colonists in the Americas, however, developed a different conception of their role within the British Empire. In particular, because the colonies were not directly represented in Parliament, colonists argued that Parliament had no right to levy taxes upon them. After colonists destroyed thousands of pounds of British-taxed tea during the Boston Tea Party, Parliament passed the Coercive Acts in 1774, punishing the colonies for their actions. These punitive Acts were vehemently opposed by the colonists, leading the newly formed Continental Congress to seek redress with King George III, in an attempt to reach a common understanding.Development of the documentConceptionOn October 1, 1774, in response to the deteriorating relationship between the American Colonies and Britain, the First Continental Congress decided to prepare a statement to King George III of Great Britain. The goal of the address was to persuade the King to revoke unpopular policies such as the Coercive Acts, which were imposed on the Colonies by the British Parliament. The committee appointed to prepare the Address consisted of Richard Henry Lee, John Adams, Thomas Johnson, Patrick Henry, and John Rutledge, with Lee designated as the committee chairman.On October 5, 1774, Congress once more returned to the subject of the Address, stressing to the committee that the document should assure the King that following the successful repeal of the Coercive Acts, the Colonies would restore favorable relations with Britain.Approval by CongressOn October 25, 1774, the petition came before Congress in its draft form. After the document was debated over and formally amended, it was then approved to be engrossed and sent to England to be presented to the King.Annotated text of the petition The petition, when written, was not divided into formal parts. However, the structure of the document allows it to be classified into sections, including an introduction, the list of grievances, reasons for attention, and a conclusion.Delivery of the document On November 2, the petition departed Philadelphia on board the ship Britannia, captained by W. Morwick. However, a storm forced the ship to return to port, delaying the delivery of the petition. It was later discovered that the paper was unfit to be presented. The second copy left port on November 6 on board the ship Mary and Elizabeth, captained by N. Falconer. It was confirmed on November 14 that the document successfully arrived in London.In Britain, a number of London merchants expressed interest in joining the Americans when the petition was presented, although Benjamin Franklin advised against the proposition. On December 21, Benjamin Franklin, Lee, and Bollan were notified by Lord Dartmouth that the petition was 'decent and respectful' and that it would be presented as soon as possible to the Houses of Parliament. However, Franklin wrote two days later that the petition could not be presented to Parliament until after the Christmas recess.Response On January 19, 1775, the petition was presented to the House of Commons by Lord North, and was also presented to the House of Lords the following day.Because the petition was intermingled with many other documents, and given the increasing turmoil of the times, little attention was given to the petition by Parliament. Likewise, the King never gave the Colonies a formal reply to their petition.Publication When the official papers of Congress were published in October and November 1774, the Petition to the King was omitted, because it was preferred that the address be read by the King before being made public. It was not until January 17 or 18, 1775 that the papers were officially released by Charles Thomson, for publication.Surviving drafts Three drafts of the Petition to the King survive to this day: one written by Patrick Henry, one written by Richard Henry Lee, and one by John Dickinson.Patrick Henry The Henry draft is written with very few corrections on its four portfolio pages. Compared to the final version of the Address, the draft contains more rhetorical descriptions of the contested Acts, and focuses less on the Colonies' past loyalty to Britain.Richard Henry Lee The Lee draft is neatly written, with minor changes, on three portfolio pages. Compared to the Henry draft, the descriptions of the grievances were brief. It does contain, however, a harsh attack on the King's ministers, most notably Bute, Mansfield, and North. Because of the inflammatory language in this draft, it is argued that this is the version that was rejected by Congress on October 21, 1774.John Dickinson The Dickinson draft is a rough composition, rite with many changes, including entire paragraphs designated to be transposed. The document is nine and a half portfolio pages, numbered 1-9 and 12, with pages 10 and 11 left blank. The text found in this draft is virtually identical to the document adopted by Congress, with the main difference lying in the list of grievances in the adopted version, which resembled those found in the other two drafts.Historical significance The Petition to the King reflected the Colonies' desire to maintain relations with Britain, given that certain demands were met. In particular, it showed that the Colonies viewed themselves as loyal to the British monarchy rather than to Parliament.See alsoFounding Fathers of the United StatesNotesReferences1774 in the Thirteen Colonies Ordinances of the Continental Congress Documents of the American Revolution Petitions 1774 in international relations George III of the United Kingdom 1774 documents", "machine_text": " The Petition to the King was a document written by the English people in 1301 in a petition to King Edward I of England. The petition was a reaction to a number of unfavorable social, economic, and political changes that had taken place during Edward's reign. The Petition is an important document in English history as it marked the first time that English subjects had formally submitted a written complaint directly to the King. The Petition itself included 15 grievances against King Edward and his government, which went beyond just criticism of existing laws. It was a bold request to restore order and justice to the realm while protecting the rights and liberties of the English people. The Petition was composed by citizens from both the nobility and peasant classes, demonstrating the significant public support that it had. The Petition chastised the King for his expensive, military-oriented policies which had depleted the public treasury and caused inflation. The document called into question the methods of raising revenue, citing extortion, usury and unlawful seizure of property, and criticized the increasing use of forced labor and taxes. The Petition stated that Edward had neglected his traditional duties to uphold the law and maintain order in the kingdom. The Petition raised many issues that were never formally addressed by Edward, but it nonetheless marked an important moment in English history. It was a testament to the growing sense of discontent in England at the time and the beginnings of a shift towards parliamentary government. The Petition was one of the earliest examples of English subjects directly addressing the King, outside of court, in an attempt to achieve meaningful reform. Ultimately, the Petition to the King was not successful in enacting systemic change during Edward’s reign. While it may have been a failure in terms of results, the Petition served as an important catalyst for the changes that occurred during the 14th century. It demonstrated a significant mobilization of public support and a willingness to vocalize discontent with the monarchy. In this way, the Petition to the King was an important milestone in the history of English democracy. ", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 17243383}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Third Mind Records\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Third Mind Records was a British independent record label, founded in February 1983 by Gary Levermore.Name The label derived its name from the book The Third Mind, a work compiled by Beat Generation author William S. Burroughs and artist Brion Gysin using the cut-up technique.History Third Mind originated from the group and fanzine Tone Death that Levermore had founded in the middle of 1982 together with two friends. During that time Levermore started contacting bands he had discovered through diverse media and on concerts which would finally be featured in Tone Death. While writing the editorial for the second issue of the fanzine, to be released around February 1983, Levermore 'began considering the possibility of releasing a cassette containing contributions by some of the groups that had been featured in the two issues to date.' His considerations led to the double cassette release Rising From The Red Sand Vols. III which was followed by volumes III and IV in 1983. The compilations featured a number of post-punk, electronic and industrial bands some of which would be later on the label's roster, and sped up Levermore's 'transition from zine enthusiast into label owner.'The Rising From The Red Sand series was met with stronger demands than Levermore had anticipated. Sending promo copies to some shops and getting a five star review in Sounds magazine led to a great number of order requests. The London-based shop of Rough Trade ordered a substantial number of copies. 'Those compilations sold quite well', remembered Levermore, 'and more or less provided the fund base to actually put out three or four albums.'After this initial success Third Mind developed slowly, with an annual quantity of seven or eight records in the first years. Levermore had to deal with tight budgets, the label's artists recorded 'for very, very low sums of money.' Signing Canadian industrial band Front Line Assembly and British singer-songwriter Bill Pritchard in 1987 meant a major step forward for the label making them the label's flagships in different markets and entailing also further post-Third Mind management duties.All of the label's releases until after Front Line Assembly's 1990 album Caustic Grip were licensed to American independent label Wax Trax.Third Mind started off with Rough Trade as distributor which changed between 1987 and 1988 when the label switched to Play It Again Sam. Due to 'policy differences' Third Mind and Play It Again Sam terminated their partnership and in 1992 Levermore moved on to partner with American metal label Roadrunner Records. In 1991, Roadrunner had already bought a 50 percent stake of Third Mind which gave Levermore a greater financial leeway since Roadrunner paid Levermore 'a salary for three years to continue running the label while they financed new releases.' Before Roadrunner, Levermore said, 'there's been many occasions over the years when I've seen a band that I wanted to work with go somewhere else and have a bit of success.'Levermore and Roadrunner ended their collaboration in April 1994. When Third Mind ended its business activities in the same year, it had released more than 100 titles. The rights to all releases passed over to Roadrunner.Fourth Dimension Records In 1983 Levermore started Fourth Dimension Records as an offshoot of Third Mind. After two releases he handed over business to Richard Johnson from British fanzine Grim Humour. The second release was born out of collaboration between Levermore and Johnson as flexi disc for Grim Humour. Johnson had already thought about starting a label by himself and 'when Gary told me he wouldn’t be operating FD after this second release, it just made sense for me to continue with the name.'ArtistsSee alsoList of record labelsReferencesBritish independent record labels Record labels established in 1983 Industrial record labels Electronic music record labels New wave record labels Cassette culture 1970s–1990s", "machine_text": " Third Mind Records is an independent record label originally founded by Paul Oakenfold and Steve Osbourne in 1992 in London, England. The label was initially created to release the latest material by Oakenfold and Osbourne's music projects including Eternal, Electribe 101 and others. Since then, Third Mind has grown to release music from a diverse list of underground, electronic and dance music artists from around the world. The name 'Third Mind' was based on the philosophy of William Burroughs and Brion Gysin, who believed that the best works of art and writing were made when two different writers or musicians would overlap and, when done correctly, create a 'Third Mind.' This idea has been used to inform the label's aesthetic vision for all releases. Oakenfold and Osbourne have since gone on to become major players in the world of electronic music, but Third Mind Records has maintained its independent and underground mentality. With a consistent discography, Third Mind has always served as a platform for up-and-coming and established independent electronic music producers and DJs. The label has released music from dozens of major artists, including The Prodigy, Future Sound of London, Daft Punk and The Chemical Brothers, as well as many lesser-known artists. In 1998, Third Mind released the classic 'Sadeness (Part 1)' by Enigma, which became an international hit. The label also released seminal albums from acts like Dave Clarke, Orbital and Slam. Third Mind Records has been instrumental in establishing and popularizing the United Kingdom's electronic music scene. With a wide range of genres, and often taking risks on unknown talent, the label has earned its place as one of the most respected and influential independent labels in the history of the music industry.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Bothy\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "A bothy is a basic shelter, usually left unlocked and available for anyone to use free of charge. It was also a term for basic accommodation, usually for gardeners or other workers on an estate. Bothies are found in remote mountainous areas of Scotland, Northern England, Ulster and Wales. They are particularly common in the Scottish Highlands, but related buildings can be found around the world (for example, in the Nordic countries there are wilderness huts). A bothy was also a semi-legal drinking den in the Isle of Lewis. These, such as Bothan Eòrapaidh, were used until recent years as gathering points for local men and were often situated in an old hut or caravan.EtymologyThe etymology of the word bothy is uncertain. Suggestions include a relation to both 'hut' as in Irish bothán and Scottish Gaelic bothan or bothag; a corruption of the Welsh term bwthyn, also meaning small cottage; and a derivation from Norse būð, cognate with English booth with a diminutive ending.CharacterMost bothies are ruined buildings which have been restored to a basic standard, providing a windproof and watertight shelter. They vary in size from little more than a large box up to two-storey cottages. They usually have designated sleeping areas, which commonly are either an upstairs room or a raised platform, thus allowing one to keep clear of cold air and draughts at floor height. No bedding, mattresses or blankets are provided. Public access to bothies is either on foot, by bicycle or boat. Most have a fireplace and are near a natural source of water. A spade may be provided to bury waste.There are thousands of examples to draw from. A typical Scottish bothy is the Salmon Fisherman's Bothy, Newtonhill, which is perched above the Burn of Elsick near its mouth at the North Sea. Another Scottish example from the peak of the salmon fishing in the 1890s is the fisherman's bothy at the mouth of the Burn of Muchalls. A further example is the Lairig Leacach Bothy in Lochaber, not far to the east of Fort William.Bothy codeBecause they are freely available to all, the continued existence of bothies relies on users helping look after them. Over the years, the Mountain Bothies Association has developed a Bothy Code that sets out the main points users should respect:Bothies are used entirely at users' own risk.Leave the bothy clean and tidy with dry kindling for the next visitors. Make other visitors welcome.Report any damage to whomever maintains the bothy. Take out all rubbish which you cannot burn. Avoid burying rubbish; this pollutes the environment. Do not leave perishable food as this attracts vermin. Guard against fire risk and ensure the fire is out before you leave. Make sure the doors and windows are properly closed when you leave.If there is no toilet at the bothy bury human waste out of sight and well away from the water supply; never use the vicinity of the bothy as a toilet.Never cut live wood or damage estate property. Use fuel sparingly.Large groups and long stays are to be discouraged – bothies are intended for small groups on the move in the mountains.Respect any restrictions on use of the bothy, for example during stag stalking or at lambing time. Please remember bothies are available for short stays only.

Bothies are not available for commercial groups.OwnershipBothies are usually owned by the landowner of the estate on which they stand, although the actual owner is rarely involved in any way, other than by permitting their continued existence, and by helping with transport of materials.

Bothies are typically small, simple shelters used as temporary accommodation by walkers, cyclists, or mountaineers. They are mostly built in remote rural areas such as the Highlands and Lake District, and are commonly found on popular walking routes in the UK. Bothies are normally inherited from generations of local farmers, with some huts being over 100 years old. There is no formal ownership of bothies, and they are normally maintained by local countryside trusts or by voluntary bothy associations. Often these organisations require donations to maintain the bothy and provide basic amenities such as firewood, a stove, and basic furniture. Bothies range from small stone cottages to basic wooden huts and are situated in some of the most stunning parts of the countryside. Most are unfurnished, and are used as shelter or overnight accommodation during bad weather or for campers. Some bothies have basic amenities such as fireplaces and stoves, while some of the more luxurious bothies have running water and electric lights. Generally, all items left in bothies should be left for others to use and not taken. Bothies are often located in remote parts of the landscape, so it is important to plan trips carefully and take the necessary safety precautions before travelling to either. This includes checking the weather forecast and taking adequate supplies. In addition, walkers should be familiar with the local area and have the necessary maps and guidebooks to know where they are travelling to and from in order to stay safe and enjoy the experience. Overall, bothies are a great way to enjoy the beauty of the countryside with minimal equipment and budget. Walking to a bothy can be an adventure in itself and the experience will always be enjoyed as the landscape is still wild and untamed but yet full of beauty. It is important to respect bothies and treat them with humility as most are privately owned and without proper maintenance, they could easily be damaged. Therefore, every visitor should always follow rules strictly to maintain the tradition of bothy use as they have done since centuries ago.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1774993}

From an early age he was attracted to painting.His uncle, the sculptor Jules Printemps, a student of François Jouffroy at the École nationale des Beaux-Arts, supported his vocation and prepared him for the entrance examination to this school. He was admitted in 1892, joined the workshop of Gustave Moreau and regularly visited it until Moreau’s death in 1898. He also associated with such artists asRouault, Matisse, Evenepoel, Albert Marquet, Edgar Maxence and Charles Milcendeau.Around this period his work was largely part of the Symbolist movement and he experimented with a poetic or mythological vision and with the sensuality of the female nude.WorkPortrait painterHe soon established his reputation as a portrait artist receiving commissions from such eminent personalities as Sully Prudhomme, the first recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature, the Prince and Princess of Waldeck, Mr and Mrs Commettant, and Prince Yusupov, the assassin of Rasputin.Léon Printemps married in 1903 and frequently painted his family in an intimate tone, particularly his daughter Lucile whose death at the age of 6 touched him profoundly, as well as his son René.Landscape painterLéon Printemps was a landscape painter his entire life. His desire to meet Flemish masters prompted him to travel to Belgium and the Netherlands at the end of the nineteenth century, returning home with various studies.Later in life his attraction to the beaches of Normandy, which were quite fashionable at the time, became more marked. After the First World War he started painting landscapes in Brittany and particularly the islands of the Vendée coast, the island of Noirmoutier, the island of Yeu, where he painted seascapes and portraits of fishermen and old farmers’ wives.Flemish and Dutch influenceThe appeal of the work of Flemish and Dutch masters during Printemps’ visits to the Louvre Museum inspired him to travel to Belgium and the Netherlands on several occasions with a desire to better understand the art of these great Flemish and Dutch masters. Several paintings, which were the outcome of his first visits to Belgium, were presented at the Salon des artistes français (1898 and 1905), the Salon artistique des PTT (1905) and in regional exhibitions, in Lille (1898) and in Nantes (1906).In 1894 Printemps travelled to Belgium for the first time, presumably in the company of other students of Gustave Moreau, visiting Bruges, Ghent, Mechelen and Antwerp. Two years later he travelled to the Meuse Valley where he painted the Bayard Rock, a remarkable sight in Dinant. In 1897, he spent some time in the Netherlands visiting the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. In 1898, he returned to Bruges and Mechelen. In 1929 and 1933 he also took his son René, who was also studying to become a painter at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, on a trip to explore these two cities.Léon Printemps died on 9 July 1945, in his studio at 6 rue Furstenberg, where the Musée National Eugène Delacroix is currently located.GalleryParticipation in Exhibitions – Awards and MeritsSalon des artistes français, between 1893 and 1939.

He is best known for his orchestral and chamber works, which often invoke traditional French music. Printemps was born in Paris, France and began playing the piano at a young age. He received his formal education in the Conservatoire de Paris in the early 1980s, studying under the tutelage of composers such as Olivier Messiaen and Henri Dutilleux. His compositions began to be influenced by his studies of classical and romantic composers, and he soon began to develop his own contemporary sound. In 1989, Printemps's first orchestral piece, “Élégiaque”, was performed by the Orchestre National de France and was met with critical acclaim. His success as a young composer caught the attention of renowned conductor Pierre Boulez and together they opened the Ensemble Intercontemporain in 1997. The ensemble was dedicated to promoting the music of up and coming young composers, with Boulez and Printemps at the forefront of the modern music scene. As the recognition of Printemps' compositional prowess grew, so did public appearances. He was invited to perform in national and international locations such as the U.S., Japan, Germany, and the Netherlands. Printemps was featured as the composer-in-residence of the Université de Montréal in 2003, as well as the Cité de la Musique in Paris in 2011. Printemps has received numerous awards throughout his career, including the Grand Prix Sacem in 2005, the French Academy of Music Award in 2006, and the Legion of Honor in 2011. He currently serves as the professor of composition at the National Conservatory of Music in Paris, and has published several works, including his most famous orchestral piece “Chansons de Cour” (2013). Léon Printemps remains as one of the premier composers of classical music in France and continues to influence new generations of musicians by providing them with works of great beauty and complexity.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 34871387}

Deployable structures are typically composed of lightweight, durable materials, such as metal frames and canvas coverings, that can be quickly erected in various configurations. Their adaptability to diverse conditions and locations makes them invaluable for certain activities, such as military camps, sporting events, and observation stations. As such, deployable structures have a broad range of uses, including providing shade and shelter in harsh climates, providing protection from the elements, and even serving as temporary medical clinics. Deployable structures are designed to be collapsible and portable, yet still be able to withstand extreme weather conditions. In most cases, they can be folded or collapsed down to a small size, and still withstand harsh wind, rain, or snow. Furthermore, they are often designed with components that are connected together with elastic cords or zippers, making them easy to disassemble and transport in a vehicle. For military applications, deployable structures have been used for a variety of purposes, such as creating portable bases for troops, providing emergency accommodation for refugees, and forming portable command posts. In addition, they can be used to quickly construct field hospitals, as well as communications and surveillance centers. In the sporting arena, deployable structures can be used as temporary stands and changing rooms, as well as emergency treatment and reception centers. For scientific purposes, they are commonly used to form field observatories or outdoor research stations. Deployable structures have become increasingly popular due to their flexibility, portability, and ease of assembly. Their efficiency, portability, and durability make them an invaluable tool to many different professions and activities. With minimal training, these structures can be quickly and easily put together, providing an unparalleled level of shelter and convenience.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 29888101}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Cartographic censorship\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Cartographic censorship is thedeliberate modification of publicly available maps in order to disguise, remove, or obfuscate potentially strategic locations or buildings, such as military bases, power plants or transmitters. Sensitive objects and places have been removed from maps since historic times, sometimes as a disinformation tactic in times of war, and also to serve competitive political and economic interests, such as during the Age of Discovery when strategic geographic information was highly sought after. In modern times requests for censorship are sent to Google Earth for certain sites that are deemed to pose security risks for national governments.History The renowned map historian, J.B. Harley, wrote in 1989:Throughout the history of modern cartography in the West ... there have been numerous instances of where maps have been falsified, of where they have been censored or kept secret, or of where they have surreptitiously contradicted the rules of their proclaimed scientific status.The early policy of secrecy proved difficult to enforce and soon maps became subject to censorship and falsification.Cartographic disinformation has long been a weapon in political propaganda, military counter-intelligence and covert diplomacy.Maps are weapons of war and the falsification of maps is a legitimate ruse de guerre. However, such Machiavellian arts were not confined to wartime, particularly in an age when there was very little peacetime. Fake maps were a weapon for all seasons, to be used against all rivals, political and commercial.North AmericaIn October 1941, before the United States entered World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt announced that he had 'a secret map' of South America titled 'Luftverkehrsnetz der Vereinigten Staaten Süd-Amerikas Hauptlinien'. He said the map had been 'made in Germany by Hitler's government' and that it showed that the Nazis had designs against the United States. It was a fake map, probably created by British intelligence agents, but Roosevelt may have thought it was genuine.EuropeIn the Age of Discovery there was a premium on geographic information: ports of call for wood and fresh water, deep natural harbours, shorter passages and straits.GermanyCensorship of maps was also used in former East Germany, especially for the areas near the border to West Germany in order to make attempts of defection more difficult.NetherlandsThe Dutch East India Company, or VOC, had a mission to censor cartographic knowledge of newly explored regions. It complained when ships owned by its rival, the Australische Compagnie, entered the Pacific by a new passage round Cape Horn, named the Le Maire Strait. The VOC persuaded the Dutch government to prohibit the publication of this latest geographical information. However, the injunction was lifted after twelve months and Willem Blaeu and other cartographers were permitted to publish revised maps.PortugalThe German cartographer Henricus Martellus made his famous mappamundi (World Map), soon after the Portuguese navigator, Bartolomeu Dias, sailed roundthe southern tip of Africa. The map is based on a Portuguese prototype (which has not survived), but the coast of southern Africa is greatly extended and dislocated. Some scholars have suggested that this distortion is a result of misinformation circulated by King John II. His purpose was to pretend that the new eastern sea route to Asia and was far longer than it actually is, in order to discourage foreign interlopers from profiting from Portuguese discoveries.Christopher Columbus may have consulted Martellus' map (or a copy) before leaving Spain in 1492 to find the western route to Asia.RussiaIn 1765, the Swiss geographer Samuel Engel, accused the Russian government of deliberately falsifying maps by extending Siberia 30° eastward. Its purpose, according to Engel, was to exaggerate the length and difficulty of the Northeast Passage along the arctic coast, in the hope of discouraging rival European merchants from attempting this route to the Pacific and China.United KingdomFrancis DrakeWhen Francis Drake sailed on his voyage round the world in 1577, he was given clear instructions that 'none shall make any charts or descriptions of the said voyage.' Furthermore, all charts made or captured from foreigners had to be delivered to the Lords of Her Majesty's Privy Council. Two hundred years later, the Admiralty's instructions to Captain Cook were almost identical.Captain CookThe British Admiralty sent James Cook on his three Pacific voyages during the Second Hundred Years War when France and Britain were vying for commercial supremacy and control of shipping lanes around the world.Cook has been accused of making 'major mistakes in his charting', such as depicting 'Stewart Island as a peninsula, and the failure to determine the insular character of Tasmania'.However, Cook was the greatest navigator of his day and too experienced to make such errors. During his three Pacific voyages, Cook was on a mission to keep secret any strategic discoveries he made such as off-shore islands and deep, natural harbours. He would report such prizes to the Admiralty when he returned to London, but meanwhile he would omit them from his journal and charts. Cook's program of disinformation was first proposed in the book Lying for the Admiralty: Captain Cook's Endeavour Voyage (2018).In 1770, Cook found Sydney Harbour by walking overland from Botany Bay, along an Aboriginal track connecting the two inlets. He also identified Bass Strait which separates Tasmania from mainland Australia. However, off-shore islands can provide a base from which operations could be mounted by a hostile power so he concealed Tasmania's insularity. Similarly, Cook depicted New Zealand's Stewart Island as a peninsula, concealing Foveaux Strait.Captain Cook's fake maps were not fake enough for the Admiralty. It wanted even greater concealment of politically sensitive discoveries when it commissioned Dr. Hawkesworth to write the official account of Cook's voyages. Thus the Admiralty's engraverdeliberately altered and refined Cook's manuscript charts when preparing them for printing. Hawkesworth's 'Journals' was a bestseller in Europe, and the Admiralty's fake maps misled Britain's rivals for decades.Cold WarIn the United Kingdom, during the Cold War period and shortly after, a number of military installations (including 'prohibited places') did not appear on commercially issued Ordnance Survey mapping. This practice was effectively curtailed with the mass availability of satellite imagery. Another aspect of map censorship in the UK is that the internal layout of HM Prison facilities were not shown on public OS mapping.False altitudes A variant of censorship of maps is putting in false altitudes. This can be important for predicting flooding. In World War I many German soldiers were killed in Belgium after their camps were flooded, even though the maps used by German military indicated the camp sites were not prone to flooding.Modern useCensorship of maps is today still often applied, although it is less effective in the age of satellite picture services. A 'dead map' is a term often applied to sensitive government maps that show the location of top secret facilities and other highly sensitive installations within a country. Russia, the United States and Great Britain all have such maps.Google Earth censors places that may be of special security concern. The following is a selection of such concerns:Former Indian president Abdul Kalam had expressed concern over the availability of high-resolution pictures of sensitive locations in India.Indian Space Research Organization says that Google Earth poses a security threat to India and seeks dialogue with Google officials.The South Korean government has expressed concern that the software offers images of the presidential palace and various military installations that could possibly be used by North Korea.Operators of the Lucas Heights nuclear reactor in Sydney, Australia asked Google to censor high resolution pictures of the facility. However, they later withdrew the request.The government of Israel also expressed concern over the availability of high-resolution pictures of sensitive locations in its territory, and applied pressure to have Israeli territory (and the Occupied Territories held by Israeli forces) appear in less clear detail.The Vice President of the United States' residence (Naval Observatory) in Washington, DC has been pixelated, as has the Federal Gold Depository at Fort Knox.From June 2007 until January 2009, downtown Washington, DC was shown using USGS aerial photography from the spring 2002, while the rest of the District of Columbia was shown using imagery from 2005.Censorship of maps is also applied by Google Maps, where certain areas are greyed out or areas are purposely left outdated with old imagery.In Lebanon, all maps concerning the country are property of the Lebanese Army and are issued by the Directory of Geographic affairs of the Lebanese military. It is considered a felony to reproduce whole or portions of maps without the permission of the military, although maps can be issued to certain universities and urban design schools for use by students and can be issued to civilian upon presenting certain documents. A notice is written on the maps prohibiting reproduction, copying or sale of the map and that it should be returned to the Ministry of National Defense upon request. This policy is meant to prohibit terrorists, outlaws, and entities that are at war with Lebanon from obtaining those maps.Similar casesLists of air traffic obstacles may not be published by many countries as many of them are strategically important (chimneys of power stations, radio masts, etc.)ExampleHiding a VLF-transmitter of Russian Navy on a map.

This includes the alteration of maps and other geographic data in order to distort the public’s understanding of countries, locations, or events. It is often used as part of a political strategy by governments, corporations, or other organizations, in an effort to control public opinion and information about the location or activities of those entities. Cartographic censorship is often employed in order to avoid political, economic, military or social embarrassment. For example, the dividing line between North and South Korea is often deliberately blurred on maps to avoid recognition by foreign powers of the Korean Demilitarized Zone, or the border demarcations between India and Pakistan. Similarly, Chinese maps of the South China Sea, published by the government and various private entities, distinctively flatten out the disputed Spratly Islands, indicating that all of the contested waters belong to China. The use of cartographic censorship can be traced back to the 16th and 17th centuries, primarily when colonial powers sought to erase indigenous claims to land. The erasure of local place names and the introduction of European names were all signs of cartographic censorship. In more recent history, the British and Russian empires engaged in cartographic censorship to create an illusion of their colonial empires' size and geographical reach. In the modern era, cartographic censorship continues to be a tool used by governments and other entities in order to control the public's understanding of geographical events and locations. In some cases, such as in maps of the Gaza Strip, mapmakers will deliberately erase Israeli settlements and replace them with Palestinian villages in order to promote the Palestinian view of the conflict. In other cases, such as with the disputed islands in the South China Sea or maps of the Crimean peninsula, mapmakers will selectively use or omit boundaries to promote one side's claim over the other's. Though maps are the most visible form of cartographic censorship, it also takes place in GIS data and data sets used in scientific research. In the case of GIS data, it is often much harder to detect, as there is no visual alteration to the data but the underlying facts are manipulated to create a false view of the location or event in question. Cartographic censorship is a censorious practice and is often condemned by civil society organisations and international bodies. The International Telecommunication Union, the international body responsible for regulating media, has stated in its code of conduct that it is “unacceptable for any organisation to distort or omit geographic or cartographic data or to deny access to such data”. Though cartographic censorship remains prevalent, advances in digital mapmaking and open-source mapping have made it easier for organisations and individuals to detect where deliberate alterations to public maps have taken place. These advances have made it much harder for governments and organisations to conceal the truth from the public through cartographic censorship.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 15379681}

He began writing in the early 1980s and has since developed a body of work that has been characterized as tackling the complex emotional history of America's African American experience. Smith's plays often draw from American history, particularly the northeastern region in which he lives and grew up. His plays, including Free Man of Color, Yellowman, How I Got That Story, and Knock Me A Kiss, often center around the struggles of African Americans and their tenuous relationship with white society. Smith's work is acclaimed for its honesty and emotional depth, and has been produced at several major regional theaters including the Goodman Theater in Chicago and the Yale Repertory Theater in New Haven, Connecticut. Smith launched his theater career with The Rainmaker, a play he wrote for members of the Negro Ensemble Company in New York City. The play was critically acclaimed and became the first in a series of plays he would write. He soon created the Off-Broadway smash hit Tulsa, which toured around the United States during the late 1980s. In 1990, his play Finishing Tusha was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize, and it has since been seen around the world, with productions staged in Germany, Japan, and South Africa. In the 2000s, Smith's plays continued to develop in popularity. His works, including Free Man of Color, knocked Me a Kiss, and The Piano Lesson, were greeted by widespread reviews, which praised the works for their talent for creating characters with complex and difficult personal histories. Smith’s body of work has led him to become a leader in African-American theater by allowing audiences to confront and discuss the ageless questions of race and the distinctions between power and freedom within American life. Smith is an alumnus of Binghamton University in New York, and a faculty advisor for Stanford University's MFA program in dramatic writing. He is currently an artist-in-residence at the Signature Theater in Washington D.C. In 2015 Smith received the Horton Foote Playwriting Award from the Lotos Club of New York, which recognizes playwrights who have made an outstanding contribution to the American Theater. Smith currently resides in Albany, New York. He enjoys running, and is an avid enthusiast of jazz music and photography.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 53342211}

From the Secretary of State depends a single department, the General Secretariat for Immigration and Emigration, body that in other times has assumed the functions of the secretariat of state.History Since its inception and its worldwide expansion, Spain has always been a country that has received and sent large amounts of population. Most of the South American population and in a lesser amount the North American population, descends from Spanish ancestry.That has provoke that a common culture and language link dozens of countries of all the world, not just Latin American countries but also Asian countries like the Philippines, African countries like Morocco or Equatorial Guinea and North American countries like United States and Canada.It is not clear when migratory issues took center stage within the Spanish administration, although there is evidence that in 1882, a section was created inside the Ministry of Development destinated to these matters. Before this, there are documents that proves that the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of the Navy and the Ministry of Overseas were in charge of overseeing the migrations in the Peninsular Spain and in the Spanish territories in the Americas, Africa, Asia and Oceania and that there were also parliamentary committees to discuss migrations matters.In the 1920s, the Ministry of Labour assumed the competencies over immigration and emigration that still today maintains. During the dictatorship of Franco, in 1956, it was created the Spanish Institute for Emigration in order to control the emigration of the Spanish population, trying to direct it to countries with cultural links like South American's. This was done through collecting labor information abroad to offer Spaniards more attractive jobs in this type of countries.In 1985, the Institute was transformed into a Directorate-General being called Directorate-General of the Spanish Institute for Emigration. The name of this directorate was changed in 1991 to Directorate-General for Migration, a more accurate name because since 1985 this directorate had competences not only over emigration, but also over all kind of migrations.The Directorate-General change its name many times, in 1996 to Directorate-General for Labor and Migration and in 1998 Directorate General for the Regulation of Migrations.In 2004 was created the current Secretariat of State under the name of Secretariat of State of Immigration and Emigration and depending on it were three directorate-generals: Directorate-General for Immigration, Directorate-General for Emigration and Directorate-General for the Integration of Immigrants.

The position may also involve international agreements and border control. Since the economic and political spheres are closely intertwined with migration, the Minister of Migration may be expected to also handle economic and foreign policy. The Secretary of State for Migration is typically appointed by the head of state, usually with the consent of the legislature, and is usually responsible for a ministry or department of their own. In some countries, the Minister may be granted additional power over related issues such as employment, integration and human rights. The role of the Secretary of State for Migration may vary depending on the country and its specific migration policy. In countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada, the Secretary of State for Migration is typically in charge of the ministry responsible for managing the country's immigration and border policies. The Secretary may work closely with other government agencies in order to monitor and control the flow of people entering and exiting the country. The Secretary may be involved in negotiating agreements with foreign countries in order to regulate the flow of foreign nationals and refugees into the country. The Secretary is also responsible for setting and overseeing the rules and regulations governing the immigration process. The Secretary is typically responsible for implementing government programs and initiatives that are related to migration. These may include promoting economic development, assisting refugees and ensuring the welfare of immigrants. The Secretary may also be responsible for providing support to refugee camps and assisting in the process of resettling refugees. The Secretary may also be tasked with promoting policies that support the integration of immigrants into society. The Secretary of State for Migration may also be involved in the decision making surrounding granting asylum seekers the right to stay in the country. They may be responsible for liaising with other departments and organizations to ensure that an asylum seeker’s application is processed first and comprehensively. The General Assembly of the United Nations (UN) has created an annual International Migrants Day held on December 18th to honour the work done by the Secretary of State for Migration. This day recognises the efforts to make migration safe, orderly and regular. The UN calls on governments to implement effective policies that protect the rights of migrants, including their right to be protected from exploitation and violence. Overall, the Secretary of State for Migration plays an important role in managing a country's immigration and border policies.

He was born in Coburg, Saxony, and studied in Leipzig before moving to the Royal Academy of Arts in Dresden in 1834. During his time in Dresden, Richter established close relationships with several of the Pre-Raphaelite artists including William Holman Hunt and John Everett Millais; these relationships were to prove influential throughout his artistic career. Richter moved to England in 1837, settling in Canterbury and then London, where he quickly established a demanding client-base in watercolour portraiture and interior paintings. Although he was best known for his delicate watercolour, he also produced a number of etchings and undertook commissions for stained glass. In 1839 Richter joined the Institution of British Architects, allowing him to gain a greater degree of access to potential patrons, and provide him with greater freedom to experiment with his artwork away from any commercial constraints. It was at this Institution that he met several of the prominent Pre-Raphaelite painters, furthering his career with commissions from the Royal Academy of Arts and the National Gallery. Throughout the 1840s Richter turned his attention to landscape paintings, travelling around the country visiting scenic locations. He was particularly fond of Snowdonia and the Brecon Beacons in Wales, and often returned to these sites to paint their rugged beauty. To complement this Romantic vision of the British landscape, Richter frequently painted pastoral scenes set in the Shropshire countryside. In 1852 Richter joined the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, standing out among its members due to his age, being significantly older than William Holman Hunt, John Everett Millais and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Despite being painted in the style of the Pre-Raphaelites, Richter's palette quickly moved away from their bright and vivid colours of their heyday, instead concentrating on a more subdued palette of greens and blues. Richter died of pneumonia in 1883; having previously suffered a period of ill-health he was cremated following his death. He is seen as an important figure in the history of British art, painting both in the style of his fellow Pre-Raphaelites but also as a high-profile representative for German art in England.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 47932471}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Convergence of measures\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "In mathematics, more specifically measure theory, there are various notions of the convergence of measures. For an intuitive general sense of what is meant by convergence in measure, consider a sequence of measures μn on a space, sharing a common collection of measurable sets. Such a sequence might represent an attempt to construct 'better and better' approximations to a desired measure μ that is difficult to obtain directly. The meaning of 'better and better' is subject to all the usual caveats for taking limits; for any error tolerance ε > 0 we require there be N sufficiently large for n ≥ N to ensure the 'difference' between μn and μ is smaller than ε. Various notions of convergence specify precisely what the word 'difference' should mean in that description; these notions are not equivalent to one another, and vary in strength.Three of the most common notions of convergence are described below.Informal descriptions This section attempts to provide a rough intuitive description of three notions of convergence, using terminology developed in calculus courses; this section is necessarily imprecise as well as inexact, and the reader should refer to the formal clarifications in subsequent sections. In particular, the descriptions here do not address the possibility that the measure of some sets could be infinite, or that the underlying space could exhibit pathological behavior, and additional technical assumptions are needed for some of the statements. The statements in this section are however all correct ifis a sequence of probability measures on a Polish space.The various notions of convergence formalize the assertion that the 'average value' of each 'sufficiently nice' function should converge:To formalize this requires a careful specification of the set of functions under consideration and how uniform the convergence should be.The notion of weak convergence requires this convergence to take place for every continuous bounded function .This notion treats convergence for different functions f independently of one another, i.e., different functions f may require different values of N ≤ n to be approximated equally well (thus, convergence is non-uniform in ).The notion of setwise convergence formalizes the assertion that the measure of each measurable set should converge:Again, no uniformity over the setis required. Intuitively, considering integrals of 'nice' functions, this notion provides more uniformity than weak convergence. As a matter of fact, when considering sequences of measures with uniformly bounded variation on a Polish space, setwise convergence implies the convergencefor any bounded measurable function . As before, this convergence is non-uniform inThe notion of total variation convergence formalizes the assertion that the measure of all measurable sets should converge uniformly, i.e. for everythere exists N such thatfor every n > N and for every measurable set . As before, this implies convergence of integrals against bounded measurable functions, but this time convergence is uniform over all functions bounded by any fixed constant.Total variation convergence of measures This is the strongest notion of convergence shown on this page and is defined as follows. Letbe a measurable space. The total variation distance between two (positive) measures μ and ν is then given byHere the supremum is taken over f ranging over the set of all measurable functions from X to [−1, 1]. This is in contrast, for example, to the Wasserstein metric, where the definition is of the same form, but the supremum is taken over f ranging over the set of measurable functions from X to [−1, 1] which have Lipschitz constant at most 1; and also in contrast to the Radon metric, where the supremum is taken over f ranging over the set of continuous functions from X to [−1, 1]. In the case where X is a Polish space, the total variation metric coincides with the Radon metric.If μ and ν are both probability measures, then the total variation distance is also given byThe equivalence between these two definitions can be seen as a particular case of the Monge-Kantorovich duality.From the two definitions above, it is clear that the total variation distance between probability measures is always between 0 and 2.To illustrate the meaning of the total variation distance, consider the following thought experiment. Assume that we are given two probability measures μ and ν, as well as a random variable X. We know that X has law either μ or ν but we do not know which one of the two. Assume that these two measures have prior probabilities 0.5 each of being the true law of X. Assume now that we are given one single sample distributed according to the law of X and that we are then asked to guess which one of the two distributions describes that law. The quantitythen provides a sharp upper bound on the prior probability that our guess will be correct.Given the above definition of total variation distance, a sequence μn of measures defined on the same measure space is said to converge to a measure μ in total variation distance if for every ε > 0, there exists an N such that for all n > N, one has thatSetwise convergence of measures Fora measurable space, a sequence μn is said to converge setwise to a limit μ iffor every set .For example, as a consequence of the Riemann–Lebesgue lemma, the sequence μn of measures on the interval [−1, 1] given by μn(dx) = (1+ sin(nx))dx converges setwise to Lebesgue measure, but it does not converge in total variation.Weak convergence of measuresIn mathematics and statistics, weak convergence is one of many types of convergence relating to the convergence of measures. It depends on a topology on the underlying space and thus is not a purely measure theoretic notion.There are several equivalent definitions of weak convergence of a sequence of measures, some of which are (apparently) more general than others. The equivalence of these conditions is sometimes known as the Portmanteau theorem.Definition. Letbe a metric space with its Borel -algebra . A bounded sequence of positive probability measuresonis said to converge weakly to the finite positive measure(denoted ) if any of the following equivalent conditions is true (heredenotes expectation or thenorm with respect to , whiledenotes expectation or thenorm with respect to ):for all bounded, continuous functions ;for all bounded and Lipschitz functions ;for every upper semi-continuous functionbounded from above;for every lower semi-continuous functionbounded from below;for all closed setsof space ;for all open setsof space ;for all continuity setsof measure .In the casewith its usual topology, ifanddenote the cumulative distribution functions of the measuresand , respectively, thenconverges weakly toif and only iffor all pointsat whichis continuous.For example, the sequence whereis the Dirac measure located atconverges weakly to the Dirac measure located at 0 (if we view these as measures onwith the usual topology), but it does not converge setwise. This is intuitively clear: we only know thatis 'close' tobecause of the topology of .This definition of weak convergence can be extended forany metrizable topological space. It also defines a weak topology on , the set of all probability measures defined on .The weak topology is generated by the following basis of open sets:whereIfis also separable, thenis metrizable and separable, for example by the Lévy–Prokhorov metric. Ifis also compact or Polish, so is .Ifis separable, it naturally embeds intoas the (closed) set of Dirac measures, and its convex hull is dense.There are many 'arrow notations' for this kind of convergence: the most frequently used are ,and .Weak convergence of random variablesLetbe a probability space and X be a metric space. Ifis a sequence of random variables then Xn is said to converge weakly (or in distribution or in law) to X asif the sequence of pushforward measures (Xn)∗(P) converges weakly to X∗(P) in the sense of weak convergence of measures on X, as defined above.See alsoConvergence of random variablesProkhorov's theoremLévy–Prokhorov metricTightness of measuresReferencesMeasure theory Measure, Convergence of", "machine_text": " Convergence of measures is a topic in measure theory that studies convergence criteria and trends between measures on similar spaces. This field of study is important as it provides insights into the relationship between different types of measures, and can be used to develop powerful models for comparison. The most general approach to convergence of measures is the Radon-Nikodym theorem, which states that if two measures have the same sets of masses, then their values must be equal for those sets. This theorem can be used to determine the set of mass measures for which convergence is assured. It can also be used to understand how closely related two measures are and to predict the rate of convergence. In modern mathematics, convergence of measures is further developed using the notion of weak convergence. This approach looks at the behavior of a sequence of measures over some space and looks at how they converge over time. Weak convergence can be used to prove weak versions of the Radon-Nikodym theorem and has been applied in a range of fields, including probability theory and harmonic analysis. Another approach to the topic of convergence of measures is the notion of absolute continuity. This looks at how two measures can be made to coincide by introducing a third measure that is absolutely continuous with each of them. This approach can be used to compare densities and Lebesgue integrals and it can also be used to prove versions of the Radon-Nikodym theorem. The relationship between measures can also be studied using the notion of bounded variation. This provides an upper bound on the difference between measures, which can be used to prove their mutual absolute continuity. This has been used to study the relationship between probability measures and the notion of convergence for certain processes, such as Markov chains. Finally, measure theory has been used to study the generalized notion of convergence of measures. This allows for a unified approach to the theory of convergence of measures, as it unifies a great deal of different criteria and trends into a single framework. As such, convergence of measures is an important topic in measure theory and has been used in a wide range of applications.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 6811795}

The gang began to spread from the Bronx to Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, Staten Island, New Rochelle, New Jersey, Massachusetts and Connecticut by the late 1980s. During this period Hispanic and white members were more common. The Black Spades have made a comeback in 2019 with more members joining. They are now TBS New Direction, a community service group championing anti-violence initiatives and providing food distribution for the food insecure.History The gang originated in 1968 in the Bronxdale Houses in the Soundview section of the Bronx. Although rumor says they were originally named the Savage Seven, the name from the start was the Black Spades.The Black Spades officially formed in Junior High School 123 on Morrison Ave in Soundview. Originally a teenage street organization, The Spades followed the teachings of The Five-Percent Nation, Malcolm X, the Nation of Islam, and were influenced by the Black Panthers and the Weather Underground Organization. Under the leadership of the original president David Brockington, who was a member of the Nation of Islam, the Spades organized to fight against the racism and bigotry in the Soundview, Clason Point, Parkchester, Castle Hill, and Throgs Neck neighborhoods of the Bronx. The 1st division Black Spades policed and protected Bronxdale Houses from the rise in crime, drug dealers, and heroin addicts who began to take over thecommunity.The gang quickly spread to nearby housing projects in the Soundview area (Monroe Houses, Soundview Houses, Bronx River Houses) and throughout the Bronx, starting a subculture inviting music in the lives of gang members. The Black Spades were also participants in the Hoe Avenue peace meeting. The Black Spades also included a women's division that started in Clason Point housing and Junior High School I.S. 131.By the early 1970s the Black Spades had increased in numbers and members began to lose focus of their original purpose. The Black Spades and younger members (Young Spades/Baby Spades) became violent and other divisions were unrestrained. David Brockington didn't like the direction that they were headed so he stepped down as 1st division president. Afterwards Monk became the new supreme president of the Black Spades which became a full-fledged street gang.New York street gang activity peaked in 1973, and then began to decline. Reasons for this decline included violence and drug use as well as a move to the burgeoning hip hop culture in park jams, block parties and clubs.Afrika Bambaataa was a warlord in a Black Spade division before becoming a famous hip hop DJ. He went on to form the Universal Zulu Nation on November 12, 1973;with several members following him.Kool DJ Herc, an early hip hop music pioneer, credits gangs including the Black Spades with getting the hip hop scene started.The organization had a strong following through the late 1990s.

It was one of the first organized gangs originating from the Bronx area. The Black Spades were considered to be among the earliest rap/hip-hop groups, pioneering the world of break dancing. Their members played a great role in spreading hip-hop culture throughout the nation. The gang's original leader was Hector 'The Mad Chief' Lescale, whose birth name was Hector Cruz Martinez. The Black Spades had many factions and sub-groups, each with its own hierarchy. The group had prominent members such as Kool Herc, who is given credit as the 'father of hip hop'; Grandmaster Flash, one of the original three masters of hip-hop deejaying; Cowboy, the founder of funk; Cool G Rap, a pioneering member of the golden age of hip hop. The gang typically dealt with drug dealing, robberies, burglaries and paint-bombing, as well as graffiti writing. Many members also participated in illegal drag racing and tagging in their blue and black uniform. The Black Spades were also known for their rapping and breakdancing talents. The Black Spades were eventually overtaken by other gangs in the area, due to their unstable and quickly shifting hierarchy. However, some of the members still remain loyal to the original gang. The impact of the Black Spades is evident in Americans’ interest in rap and hip-hop culture to this day. The gang is credited for many elements of the hip-hop culture, such as graffiti writing, DJing, break dancing and MCing. They also served as a source of inspiration for the break dancing movie Breakin'.

He also served as Duke of Cieszyn.Born in Vienna on 8 September 1633, and baptised as Ferdinand Franz,Ferdinand IV was the eldest son of Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor and his first wife Maria Anna, the daughter of Philip III of Spain. At a young age, Ferdinand IV took his father's role as Archduke of Austria. In 1646, Ferdinand IV became King of Bohemia as he shared the role with his father Emperor Ferdinand III. He was crowned on 5 August 1646, and also shared the role of Duke of Cieszyn with Ferdinand III. Ferdinand IV also shared the role as King of Hungary and Croatia with his father; his coronation took place on 16 June 1647 in Pressburg, present-day Slovakia.After the French attempted to modify the system of the election of King of the Romans, Emperor Ferdinand III made an opportunity of a recent decline in the prestige of France, and was able to install Ferdinand IV as King of the Romans, and de facto heir to the Holy Roman Empire. He was crowned in Ratisbon (Regensburg, present-day south-east Germany) on 18 June 1653 after gaining the position on 31 May 1653. However, Ferdinand IV unexpectedly died of smallpox in Vienna on 9 July 1654, and was later succeeded by his brother Leopold I as King of the Romans. Prior to his death, it was planned that he would marry Philip IV of Spain's daughter Maria Theresa of Spain, his cousin.

As King of the Romans, Ferdinand was the head of the Holy Roman Empire, and his rule oversaw many of the political and religious conflicts in Europe during the Reformation and Counter Reformation eras. Ferdinand was born in 1473, son of Emperor Maximilian I and Mary of Burgundy. As a child he was known as 'Ferdinand the Learned' due to his aptitude for languages, although he was not originally seen as a potential successor to his father as emperor. He was only named heir after his elder brother, Philip the Fair, died in a riding accident in 1492. Ferdinand succeeded Maximilian as emperor at the Diet of Worms in 1493, becoming King of the Romans and simultaneously Archduke of Austria and King of Bohemia. In the beginning of his reign he concentrated much of his energy on the repression of the growing Protestant movements in the Holy Roman Empire. His army, led by his cousin and eventual successor Charles V, was successful in stopping the spread of Lutheranism, most notably their victory at the Battle ofAugsburg in 1530. On the international stage, Ferdinand's rule was marked by conflict with other European powers, particularly France, with whom he was engaged in a series of wars for control of northern Italy. Though the wars, begun in 1494 and ending in 1559, proved costly for all involved, Ferdinand ultimately emerged with more territory in northern Italy and increased influence in the region. Finally, Ferdinand's reign was important in setting the foundations for the eventual dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806. Ferdinand abdicated in 1558, leaving the throne to his son Karl II, who in turn passed the title of Holy Roman Emperor to his brother, Charles V the following year. Without Karl's claimed right to the throne, the concept of a universal Roman Empire quickly faded. In conclusion, Ferdinand IV of Habsburg was a key figure in the Reformation and Counter Reformation eras of European history. His rule as King of the Romans from 1493-1558 was marked by religious and political conflicts, as well as his campaigns for control of northern Italy. After his death in 1564 his title of Holy Roman Emperor was passed on to his eldest son, Karl II, and his legacy to the eventual dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 217682}

It is the top-tier competition for clubs whose countries' national teams compete in the Six Nations Championship. Clubs qualify for the Heineken Champions Cup via their final positions in their respective national/regional leagues (English Premiership, French Top 14, and United Rugby Championship) or via winning the second-tier Challenge Cup; those that do not qualify are instead eligible to compete in the second-tier Challenge Cup.Between 1995 and 2014, the equivalent competition was known as the Heineken Cup and was run by European Rugby Cup. Following disagreements between its shareholders over the structure and governance of the competition, it was taken over by EPCR and its name was changed to the European Rugby Champions Cup, without title sponsorship. Heineken returned as sponsor for the 2018–19 season, resulting in the competition being known as the Heineken Champions Cup.Toulouse are the current holders of the title, having won their record setting fifth title by beating Stade Rochelais in the 2021 final.HistoryHeineken Cup1995–1999The Heineken Cup was launched in the summer of 1995 on the initiative of the then Five Nations Committee to provide a new level of professional cross border competition. Twelve sides representing Ireland, Wales, Italy, Romania and France competed in four pools of three with the group winners going directly into the semi-finals. English and Scottish teams did not take part in the inaugural competition. From an inauspicious beginning in Romania, where Toulouse defeated Farul Constanţa 54–10 in front of a small crowd, the competition gathered momentum and crowds grew. Toulouse went on to become the first European cup winners, eventually beating Cardiff in extra time in front of a crowd of 21,800 at Cardiff Arms Park.Clubs from England and Scotland joined the competition in 1996–97. European rugby was further expanded with the advent of the European Challenge Cup for teams that did not qualify for the Heineken Cup. The Heineken Cup now had 20 teams divided into four pools of five. Only Leicester and Brive reached the knock-out stages with 100 per cent records and ultimately made it to the final, Cardiff and Toulouse falling in the semi-finals. After 46 matches, Brive beat Leicester 28–9 in front of a crowd of 41,664 at Cardiff Arms Park, the match watched by an estimated television audience of 35 million in 86 countries.The season 1997–98 saw the introduction of a home and away format in the pool games. The five pools of four teams, which guaranteed each team a minimum of six games, and the three quarter-final play-off matches all added up to a 70-match tournament. Brive reached the final again but were beaten late in the game by Bath with a penalty kick. Ironically, English clubs had decided to withdraw from the competition in a dispute over the way it was run.Without English clubs, the 1998–99 tournament revolved around France, Italy and the Celtic nations. Sixteen teams took part in four pools of four. French clubs filled the top positions in three of the groups and for the fourth consecutive year a French club, in the shape of Colomiers from the Toulouse suburbs, reached the final. Despite this it was to be Ulster's year as they beat Toulouse (twice) and reigning French champions Stade Français on their way to the final at Lansdowne Road, Dublin. Ulster then carried home the trophy after a 21–6 win over Colomiers in front of a capacity 49,000 crowd.1999–2004 English clubs returned in 1999–00. The pool stages were spread over three months to allow the competition to develop alongside the nations' own domestic competitions, and the knockout stages were scheduled to take the tournament into the early spring. For the first time clubs from four nations – England, Ireland, France and Wales – made it through to the semi-finals. Munster's defeat of Toulouse in Bordeaux ended France's record of having contested every final and Northampton Saints' victory over Llanelli made them the third English club to make it to the final. The competition was decided with a final between Munster and Northampton, with Northampton coming out on top by a single point to claim their first major honour.England supplied two of the 2000–01 semi-finalists – Leicester Tigers and Gloucester – with Munster and French champions Stade Français also reaching the last four. Both semi-finals were close, Munster going down by a point 16–15 to Stade Français in Lille and the Tigers beating Gloucester 19–15 at Vicarage Road, Watford. The final, at Parc des Princes, Paris, attracted a crowd of 44,000 and the result was in the balance right up until the final whistle, but Leicester walked off 34–30 winners.Munster reached the 2001–02 final with quarter-final and semi-final victories on French soil against Stade Français and Castres. Leicester pipped Llanelli in the last four, after the Scarlets had halted Leicester's 11-match Heineken Cup winning streak in the pool stages. A record crowd saw Leicester become the first side to successfully defend their title.From 2002, the European Challenge Cup winner now automatically qualified for the Heineken Cup. Toulouse's victory over French rivals Perpignan in 2003 meant that they joined Leicester as the only teams to win the title twice. Toulouse saw a 19-point half-time lead whittled away as the Catalans staged a dramatic comeback in a match in which the strong wind and showers played a major role, but Toulouse survived to win.In 2003–04 the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) voted to create regions to play in the Celtic League and represent Wales in European competition. Henceforth, Wales entered regional sides rather than the club sides that had previously competed. English side London Wasps had earned their first final appearance by beating Munster 37–32 in a Dublin semi-final while Toulouse triumphed 19–11 in an all-French contest with Biarritz in a packed Stade Chaban-Delmas in Bordeaux. The 2004 final saw Wasps defeat defending champions Toulouse 27–20 at Twickenham to win the Heineken Cup for the first time. The match was widely hailed as one of the best finals. With extra time looming at 20–20, a late opportunist try by scrum half Rob Howley settled the contest.2005–2014 The tenth Heineken Cup final saw the inaugural champions Toulouse battle with rising stars Stade Français when Murrayfield was the first Scottish venue to host the final. Fabien Galthié's Paris side led until two minutes from the end of normal time before Frédéric Michalak levelled the contest for Toulouse with his first penalty strike. He repeated this in the initial stages of extra time and then sealed his side's success with a superb opportunist drop-goal. Toulouse became the first team to win three Heineken Cup titles.In 2006, Munster defeated Biarritz in the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff, 23–19. It was third time lucky for the Irish provincial side, who had previously been denied the ultimate prize twice by Northampton and Leicester.The 2006–07 Heineken Cup would be distributed to over 100 countries following Pitch International's securing of the rights. That season was the first time in the history of the competition that two teams went unbeaten in pool play, with both Llanelli Scarlets and Biarritz doing so. Biarritz went into their final match at Northampton Saints with a chance to become the first team ever to score bonus-point wins in all their pool matches, but were only able to score two of the four tries needed. Leicester defeated Llanelli Scarlets to move into the final at Twickenham, with the possibility of winning a Treble of championships on the cards, having already won the Anglo-Welsh Cup and the English Premiership. However, Wasps won the final 25 points to 9 in front of a tournament record 81,076 fans.During competition there was uncertainty over the future of the tournament after the 2006–07 season as French clubs had announced that they would not take part because of fixture congestion following the Rugby World Cup and an ongoing dispute between English clubs and the RFU. It was speculated that league two teams might compete the next season, the RFU saying 'If this situation is not resolved, the RFU owes it to the sport to keep this competition going...We have spoken to our FDR clubs, and if they want to compete we will support them.'. A subsequent meeting led to the announcement that the tournament would be played in 2007–08, with clubs from all the six nations. On 20 May it was announced that both French and English top-tier teams would be competingIn the 2008 final, Munster won the cup for their second time ever by beating Toulouse at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.Leinster won the title in 2009 in their first ever final after beating Munster in the semi-final in front of a then world record Rugby Union club match attendance in Croke Park. They beat the Leicester Tigers in the final at Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh. They also beat Harlequins 6–5 in the quarter-finals at Twickenham Stoop, in the famous Bloodgate scandal.In the 2010 final, Toulouse defeated Biarritz Olympique in the Stade de France to claim their fourth title, a Heineken Cup record.The 16th Heineken Cup tournament in 2011 resulted in an Irish province lifting the title for the fourth time in six years as Leinster recorded their second triumph in the competition. They defeated former multiple Heineken Cup winners Leicester and Toulouse in the quarter- and semi-finals. At the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, in front of 72,000 spectators, Leinster fought back from a 22–6 half-time deficit in the final against Northampton Saints, scoring 27 unanswered points in 26 second-half minutes, winning 33–22 in one of the tournament's greatest comebacks. Jonathan Sexton won the man-of-the-match award, having scored 28 of Leinster's points total, which included two tries, three conversions, and four penalties.Leinster successfully defended their crown in 2012 at Twickenham, eclipsing fellow Irish province and former champions Ulster 42–14 to establish the highest Heineken Cup final winning margin. The performance broke a number of Heineken Cup Final records. Leinster became only the second team to win back-to-back titles, and the only team ever to win three championships in four years. In addition, the game had the highest attendance at a final (81,774), the highest number of tries (5) and points (42) scored by one team and the highest points difference (28).The final edition of the tournament as constituted as the Heineken Cup was won for a second time by Toulon at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff in May 2014.Champions Cup2014–18 The tournament began on 17 October 2014, with Harlequins playing Castres Olympique in the first ever Champions Cup game. Toulon retained their title, beating Clermont 24–18 in a repeat of the 2013 Heineken Cup Final, thereby becoming the first club to win three European titles in a row.Following the November 2015 Paris attacks, all Round 1 games due to take place in France that weekend were called off, along with the Round 2 fixture between Stade Français and Munster. Rescheduling of some matches was difficult, partly caused by fixture congestion due to the 2015 Rugby World Cup.Saracens won their first title defeating Racing 92 in Lyon 21–9 in 2016 final and followed it up with their second in 2017, beating Clermont 28–17 in Edinburgh.In 2017–18 season, Leinster overcame the 'pool of death' consisting of Glasgow Warriors (who finished the 2017–18 season top of the Pro14), Montpellier (who finished the 2017–18 season top of the TOP 14) and Exeter (who finished the 2017–18 season top of the English Premiership), beating all three teams both home and away. Leinster went on to face the back to back Champions Saracens, dispatching a defeat at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin, to set up a semi-final against reigning Pro12 champions Scarlets. Leinster defeated Scarlets to face Racing 92 in Champions Cup Final in Bilbao. Leinster defeated Racing 92 by a scoreline of 15–12, becoming only the second team in history to earn four European titles. Leinster also won the Pro14 title to become the first Pro14 side to win such a double of trophies.Heineken Champions Cup2018–2020 Saracens won the 2018–19 competition, defeating defending champions Leinster 20–10 in the final. Saracens were in breach of the Premiership salary cap during this edition and the previous year, in which they qualified for the 2018–19 cup. However, the EPCR have confirmed that Premiership ruling will not affect the results of the Heineken Champions Cup for 2018–19 or previous years, stating: 'The Saracens decision is based on Gallagher Premiership Rugby regulations and does not affect the club's European record or current status in the Heineken Champions Cup.' There were no Saracens representatives at the launch of the 2019–20 competition, held in Cardiff on 6 November 2019. EPCR released a statement saying they were 'disappointed to learn of Saracens' decision to make their club representatives unavailable for today's official 2019–20 season launch'.2020– Because of the COVID-19 pandemic the 2020–21 competition took on a revised format. A similar but revised 24 team format will remain for 2021–22.FormatQualification Typically, a total of 24 teams qualify for the competition, the same number as used to qualify for the Heineken Cup. At least 23 of the 24 teams qualify automatically based on position in their respective leagues. The winner of the Challenge Cup will earn a place regardless of league position.Team distribution is typically: England: 8 teams, based on position in Premiership Rugby France: 8 teams, based on position in the Top 14 Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales: 8 teams, based on performance in the United Rugby Championship (previously the Pro14). From 2014 to 2017, the best placed team from each country in the Pro14 qualified for the competition, along with the best three remaining teams regardless of nationality In 2017, it was announced that this format would change. Starting with qualification for the 2018–19 competition, the Pro14 places would be assigned regardless of nationality, rather than the requirement that at least one team qualify from each participating nation.20th team qualification (-2020)Until 2018–19, the final team each season qualified through a play-off competition between the best placed unqualified teams.For the 2014–15 season, this was a two legged play-off between the seventh-placed teams in the Top 14 and the English Premiership. The team with the highest aggregate score over the two legs advancing to the Champions Cup. For the 2015–16 season, there was a three-team play-off; the seventh-placed team in the English Premiership, or the winners of the 2014–15 European Rugby Challenge Cup if members of the English Premiership and not already qualified, would play the eighth-placed (or highest non-qualified) team from the Pro14, with the winner playing the seventh-placed team in the Top 14. To facilitate Rugby World Cup 2015, there were no play-offs for the 2016–17 Champions Cup with the 20th place going to the winner of the 2016 Challenge Cup if not already qualified. For 2017–18, the play-off format included four clubs with a second Pro14 club competing. If not already qualified, the winner of the Challenge Cup will take the place in the play-offs of the seventh-ranked club in the English Premiership and Top 14, and will also take the place of the second Pro14 club if applicable. In May 2017, it was announced that, starting with qualification for the 2018–19 Champions Cup, the play-off will be scrapped in favour of awarding the final berth using the following criteria: Champions Cup winner, if not already qualified. European Rugby Challenge Cup winner, if not already qualified. Challenge Cup losing finalist, if not already qualified. Challenge Cup semi-finalist, if one has not already qualified (or the winner of a play-off between the semi-finalists, if both have not already qualified). Highest ranked non-qualified club by virtue of league position from the same league as the Champions Cup winner.CompetitionGroup stage For the pool stage teams are placed into pools via a draw. The teams are ranked based on domestic league performance the previous season, and arranged into four tiers. Teams are then drawn from the tiers into pools at random, with the restriction that no team will be drawn in the same pool as another team from the same league and tier.Teams will play two other teams in their pool from a different league twice, at home and away, and match points will be awarded depending on the result of each game, with teams receiving four points for a win, and two for a draw. Teams can also earn bonus points for scoring four or more tries and/or for losing a match by seven points or fewer.Following the completion of the pool stage, 16 teams qualify for the knock-out stage of the Champions Cup with a further 6 of the remaining 8 dropping into the Challenge Cup.Knock-out stage The sixteen remaining teams are seeded from 1–16 based on performance in their respective pool.The round of 16 is played over two legs with each team playing both home and away. The quarter-finals are unbracketed, and follow the standard 1v8, 2v7, 3v6, 4v5 format, as found in the Heineken Cup.The winners of the quarter-finals will contest the two semi-finals, Up to and including the 2014–15 season, matches and home country advantage were determined by a draw by EPCR.In 2015–16, EPCR decided to put a new procedure in place. In lieu of the draw that used to determine the semi-final pairing, EPCR announced that a fixed semi-final bracket would be set in advance, and that the home team would be designated based on 'performances by clubs during the pool stages as well as the achievement of a winning a quarter-final match away from home'. Semi-final matches must have been played at a neutral ground in the designated home team's country.Since 2018–19, the higher-seeded team will have home country/venue advantage for each semi-final regardless of whether they won their quarter-final at home or on the road. The EPRC may now also use its discretion to allow semi-finals to be played at a qualified club's home venue.The winners of the semi-finals will contest the final, which will be held in May each season.2020–Because of the COVID-19 pandemic the 2020–21 competition took on a revised format.A similar format will remain for 2021–22.FinalsWins by clubWins by nationControversyDisagreements over structuregovernance English and French rugby union clubs had long held concerns over the format and structure of the Heineken Cup organised by European Rugby Cup (ERC), predominantly in relation to the distribution of funds and an imbalance in the qualification process. Some proposals had been made that, in future, rather than Ireland, Wales, Scotland and Italy each sending their top-placed teams in the Pro14 to the Heineken Cup, the top teams from the league as a whole should be sent, regardless of nationality. This founding principle was eventually conceded however, when it was agreed that the top-placed teams from the four should participate in the new European competition.In June 2012, following that year's final, Premiership Rugby and the Ligue Nationale de Rugby (LNR), on behalf of the English and French clubs respectively, gave ERC two years' notice of withdrawing from the Heineken Cup and also the second-tier Challenge Cup competitions from the start of the 2014–15 season. Soon after, in September, Premiership Rugby announced a new four-year TV deal worth £152 million with BT Sport including rights for English clubs' European games - which had previously been the sole responsibility of ERC. ERC responded with claims that Premiership Rugby did not have the rights to a European tournament and announced a four-year deal with Sky Sports. The actions of Premiership Rugby were said to have 'thrown northern hemisphere rugby into disarray'.Subsequently, in September 2013, the English and French clubs announced their intention to organise their own tournament, to be named the Rugby Champions Cup, from 2014 to 2015 season onwards, and invited other European clubs, provinces, and regions to join them. The IRB (now World Rugby) stepped into the debate at the same time to announce its opposition to the creation of a breakaway tournament. In October 2013, Regional Rugby Wales, on behalf of the four Welsh regions, confirmed its full support for the proposed new Rugby Champions Cup. Negotiations for both a new Heineken Cup and Rugby Champions Cup were then ongoing.On 10 April 2014, following almost two years of negotiations, a statement was released under the aegis of European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR) announcing that the nine stakeholders to the new competition, the six unions, and three umbrella club organisations (Premiership Rugby, LNR, and Regional Rugby Wales), had signed Heads of Agreement for the formation of the European Rugby Champions Cup, the European Rugby Challenge Cup and a new, third tournament, initially called the Qualifying Competition and now known as the European Rugby Continental Shield. On the same day, BT and Sky announced an agreement that divided coverage of the new European competitions. Both will split the pool matches, quarter-finals, and semi-finals equally, and both will broadcast the final. BT will get first choice of English Premiership club matches in the Champions Cup, with Sky receiving the same privilege for the Challenge Cup.Premiership Rugby and LNR were described as having employed 'bully-boy tactics' by The Irish Times.Organisation Shortly after the establishment of European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR) to administer the new competition from a new base in Neuchatel, Switzerland, the running of the inaugural 2014–15 tournament was subcontracted to the organisation it had been meant to replace, Dublin-based European Rugby Cup (ERC). This was despite the latter having been described by chairman of Premiership Rugby, Quentin Smith, as 'no longer fit for purpose'. This was described as 'something of an about-turn' by The Daily Telegraph.EPCR were still looking to hire a permanent chairman and director-general more than a year after their establishment.2015 final The inaugural Champions Cup final was brought forward by three weeks due to a French desire not to interrupt their domestic playoffs. This was said to have 'devalued' and 'diminished the status of the occasion as the pinnacle of European club rugby'.While the 2015 Heineken Cup final had been due to take place at the San Siro in Milan, the first European final to take place in Italy, the new organisers decided to move it to Twickenham Stadium in London in order to 'guarantee the best possible financial return to clubs'. However, with less than two weeks to go before the final took place, it was reported that fewer than half of the stadium's 82,000 seats had been sold, with just 8,000 French supporters travelling to London to watch Toulon face Clermont. The organisers subsequently made 'free' tickets available on Ticketmaster (with only a £2 booking fee applicable), before admitting to this being a mistake – the offer supposed to have been linked to a purchase of a Premiership final ticket. This was described as an 'embarrassing fiasco' by the Western Mail in Wales. 56,622 fans subsequently attended the game. EPCR were said to have 'failed on many levels' by The Irish Times, with the attendance figure for the final 'a fitting postscript to the hastily-convened decider to what was, after all the brinkmanship, a hastily-convened tournament'.Sponsorship and suppliersSponsors During the creation of the Champions Cup, former organisers ERC had been criticised for 'failing to maximise the commercial potential' of the Heineken Cup. New organisers EPCR pledged to move from a single title sponsor format to a Champions League-style partner system, with 2–3 primary partners projected for the inaugural tournament and 5 being the ultimate target. However, only Heineken agreed to sign up for the 2014–15 season, at a much reduced price from that which they had been paying previously.Principal partners Heineken (1995–2014; 2018–Present)Heineken, who had sponsored the Heineken Cup since 1995, signed on as the first partner for the Champions Cup in 2014, and were credited as the Founding Partner of European Rugby. They returned to the competition as title sponsors in 2018, resulting in it being renamed as the 'Heineken Champions Cup'. Due to French restrictions on alcohol advertising, it is known as the 'H Cup' in France.

Coverage was split between the two in order to raise revenues, but this was said to have 'diluted the focus and reduced the buzz around the event'.Attendance This lists the average attendances for each season's European Cup competition, as well as the total attendance and highest attendance for that season. The final is typically the most-attended match, as it is generally held in a larger stadium than any club's home venue.The highest attended match of the 2002–03 competition was a quarter-final between Leinster and Biarritz before 46,000 fans at Lansdowne Road in Dublin.The 2009 final held at Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh was only the third most-attended match that season. The most-attended match was a semi-final between Irish rivals Leinster and Munster played in Croke Park in Dublin. The attendance of 82,208 set what was then a world record for a club match in the sport's history. Second on that season's list was a pool match between Stade Français and Harlequins that drew 76,569 to Stade de France in Paris (a venue that Stade Français has used for select home matches since 2005).While the 2010–11 tournament's highest attended match was unsurprisingly the final, the second-highest attended match was notable in that it was held in Spain. Perpignan hosted Toulon in a quarter-final before a sellout crowd of 55,000 at the Olympic Stadium in Barcelona, Spain.See alsoList of European Rugby Champions Cup finalsEuropean Rugby Challenge CupPremiership (England)United Rugby Championship (Ireland, Italy, Scotland, South Africa and Wales)Top 14 (France)NotesReferencesExternal linksOfficial websiteRugby union competitions in Europe for clubs and provinces 1995 establishments in Europe Recurring sporting events established in 1995 Multi-national professional rugby union leagues Multi-national professional sports leagues", "machine_text": " The European Rugby Champions Cup is the top-level pan-European professional rugby union club competition which exists to determine the continent's best club rugby team each year. Organized by European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR), the competition was first established in 2014. It replaced the former Heineken Cup, which ran from 1995 to 2014, as the strongest European club rugby competition. The competition is contested by teams from the six main European domestic leagues: the English Premiership, French Top 14, Guinness Pro14 (comprising teams from Ireland, Italy, Scotland, and Wales), and the two main Spanish divisions, the División de Honor and División de Honor Femenina. The current champions are French side La Rochelle, who beat Toulouse in the 2021 final. The Champions Cup involves 20 teams competing in five Pool stages, where each Pool is contested by four teams. Each team plays one another in home and away fixtures, with the three highest-ranked teams in each Pool progressing to the knockout stages of the tournament. At the end of the Pool stages, the top two teams from each and the two third-placed teams with the most tournament points progress to the quarter final stage. The knockout stages are single-elimination, with a single-legged semifinal, followed by the European Rugby Champions Cup Final. The ultimate winners of the tournament are rewarded with the European Rugby Champions Cup Trophy, which is a silver cup modelled on the original design from the Heineken Cup. The Champions Cup also encompasses various awards. These include Player of the Tournament, Top Points Scorer, Top Try Scorer, and several other awards determined by the EPCR. The tournament is widely considered to be one of the best of its kind in the world, and has become internationally celebrated since its inception in 2014. It is followed avidly throughout Europe, Asia, and Oceania, with many fans attending the final each year. In addition to the rugby, the weekend of the Champions Cup Final often hosts other events including concerts, entertainment, and the winners’ presentation ceremony.

The team joined the NHL in 1967 as an expansion team with five other teams; the Cleveland Barons, another 1967 NHL expansion team, were merged with the North Stars in the 1978–79 season. The North Stars played in the Stanley Cup Finals twice: as the Prince of Wales Conference champions in the 1980–81 season, and in the 1990–91 season after winning the Clarence S. Campbell Bowl, but lost in both Finals. The North Stars played their home games at the Met Center. The team relocated to Dallas, Texas in 1993, after former owner Norman Green announced that he was moving the team to Dallas's Reunion Arena in search of a better economic situation, and are now known as the Dallas Stars. The North Stars played in the Norris Division of the Clarence Campbell Conference in the National Hockey League (NHL) in their last season. There were 16 head coaches for the North Stars team.The North Stars' first head coach and general manager was Wren Blair, who coached for the first three seasons, and was the North Stars' general manager until 1974; Jack Gordon, Lou Nanne, and Bob Gainey were also the general manager of the North Stars during their tenures as head coach. Nine of the first twelve North Stars head coaches lasted less than two complete seasons, while ten of the first twelve head coaches have spent their entire NHL head coaching careers with the North Stars. Gordon was the first North Stars head coach to have coached more than two complete seasons, with four.Several head coaches have had multiple tenures with the North Stars. Glen Sonmor served three terms as North Stars head coach. He is the North Stars' all-time leader for the most regular-season games coached, regular-season game wins, regular-season points, playoff games coached, and playoff-game wins. Sonmor's first term lasted five seasons, the longest duration for one North Stars head coach term; his last term lasted two games, which was the shortest tenure. Blair, Gordon and Charlie Burns each served two terms as the North Stars' head coach. None of their second terms were winning seasons.Burns, Ted Harris, Parker MacDonald, Nanne, and Murray Oliver had once played for the North Stars; Burns is the only person to have been a player-coach for the North Stars, having done so in the 1969–70 season. 1980 U.S. Olympic 'Miracle on Ice' coach Herb Brooks, who coached the North Stars in the 1987–88 season, is the only North Stars head coach to have been elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame as a builder; Harry Howell and Gainey were inducted as players. Sonmor and Gainey are the only head coaches to reach the Stanley Cup Finals with the North Stars, in the 1981 and 1991 Finals respectively. Gainey was the last head coach of the North Stars; he coached the franchise until the 1995–96 season.KeyHead coachesHead coaches with multiple tenuresNotesA running total of the number of coaches of the North Stars.

The North Stars attained the best success during the 1988–89 season, when the team won the division title and reached the Stanley Cup Finals. The franchise has seen 28 head coaches fill the vacancy since 1967, when the team was initiated into the National Hockey League. The most successful Minnesota North Stars coaches, to date, are Glen Sonmor, who led the team to playoff appearances three years in a row from 1987 to 1989, and Jack Gordon, who remains the team's longest-tenured head coach, coaching for seven seasons from 1978-1985. Roger Neilson was the first head coach of the Minnesota North Stars, coaching the 1967–68 season which saw the team make its debut in the NHL. Parker MacDonald followed suit, then Jack Gordon, who coached the team to its first division championship in the 1979-80 season. Glen Sonmor, who coached the North Stars from 1986 to 1990, was the longest-tenured and most successful head coach for the North Stars. His success brought the franchise to the Stanley Cup Finals in its first season, which the team lost to the Edmonton Oilers. This was followed by reasons of competence and results. After Sonmor left the team, Bob Gainey became the North Star's head coach. He was the first North Stars coach to qualify for the playoffs after the expansion to 14 teams in 1991–92. The post-Gainey era saw Dave Tippett, Ken Hitchcock, Jacques Lemaire, and Marc Crawford at the helm of the Minnesota franchise. Jacques Lemaire was the most successful of these coaches and guided the team to their first post-season appearance after the expansion. Lemaire's tenure was followed by a series of brief coaching tenures. Doug McLean was aided by assistant coach Andy Murray and guided the team to their first division title in 15 seasons. He was then succeeded by former North Stars player, Lorne Henning. Darryl Sutter then took the head coach role for the rest of the 1996–97 season. Jacques Lemaire was then rehired in 2000 and Doug Palazzari succeeded Lemaire in 2003. The Mike Keenan era began in 2005, but Keenan was not retained after the 2007 season. Todd Richards filled the head coach role from 2008 until his dismissal in 2009. Following Richards, the head coaching role was permanently filled by Marc Crawford. Tom Renney and Rich Winter followed the Crawford era and served brief stints as the North Stars' head coach. Dean Evason and Don Granato finished off the Minnesota North Stars' head coach history, and the team became the Dallas Stars in 1993. The Minnesota North Stars' head coach position has seen its share of successes, including a berth in the 1989 Stanley Cup Finals and a division title, as well as a long list of disappointments and unfinished seasons. Despite the team's relocation to Dallas and subsequent change of name, the Minnesota North Stars' legacy remains when it comes to the team's long and storied head coaching history.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 10102776}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Union representative\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "A union representative, union steward, or shop steward is an employee of an organization or company who represents and defends the interests of their fellow employees as a labor union member and official. Rank-and-file members of the union hold this position voluntarily (through democratic election by fellow workers or sometimes by appointment of a higher union body) while maintaining their role as an employee of the firm. As a result, the union steward becomes a significant link and conduit of information between the union leadership and rank-and-file workers.The duties of a union steward vary according to each labor union's constitutional mandate for the position. In general, most union stewards perform the following functions: Monitor and enforce the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement (labor contract) to ensure both the firm and union worker are not violating the terms of the agreement. Ensure that the firm is in compliance with all federal, state and local laws and regulations. Represent and defend fellow workers whom the firm believes violated company policy or the terms and conditions of the collective bargaining agreement, often through the grievance process. Communicate and disseminate official union policy, memos and directives to workers in the shop. Popularize and promote union consciousness and values in the workplace.Shop stewardUnlike other union representatives, stewards work on the shop floor, connecting workers with union officials at regional or national levels.The role of shop stewards may vary from being a mere representative of a larger national union towards independent structures with the power of collective bargaining in the workplace.In the United Kingdom, a network called Shop Stewards Movement organised shop stewards against the first World War. In Germany, a network of shop stewards called Revolutionary Stewards took an important role in the revolutionary 'January Strike'.Collective bargaining agreement sample steward clause Labor contract between the Service Employees International Union, Local 767, and Windemere Nursing5.6 Stewards.(a) The Home agrees to recognize such Union stewards, duly appointed by and acting as agents of the Union, who may receive complaints and process grievances through the grievance procedure.

They are often delegated to negotiate collective bargaining agreements, mediate labor disputes, work as union advocates for internal grievances, and even protect employment rights. Usually, a union representative is democratically elected by the labor union's members to serve in the particular role. Generally, union representatives are either administrators, organizers, or activists who take part in the activities of the union. They are typically present at executive council meetings and labor union conventions and take part in all decisions relating to union membership rights, benefits, and privileges. Union representatives are also often part of labor unions' professional bodies, such as bargaining committees, which handle negotiations between labor unions and employers. In particular, union representatives who serve on bargaining committees have the responsibility of negotiating union contracts for members and ensuring that any changes in collective bargaining regulations are mutually agreed upon by both sides. In some organizations, the job of the union representative is to investigate, publicize, and defend any claims of discrimination, unfair labor practices, or safety hazards. Union representatives are required to be knowledgeable about the organization's labor laws, rules, and regulations regarding labor disputes, and they may present grievances to management on behalf of union members. Representatives can even represent members in court cases, and in other legal proceedings. In addition to protecting and promoting the interests of the union members, union representatives also often serve as the source of information for the group. They have the ability to disseminate information about the union's activities and objectives and can also produce educational materials regarding labor laws, safety regulations, collective bargaining agreements, and collective bargaining rights. Union representatives may also serve as the organizational bridge between the labor union and potential employers. Through their negotiating and formulation of collective bargaining agreements, union representatives can often attract new employers, helping to increase the number of union members. This in turn, can create workspace security, job opportunities, job security, and better working conditions for union members. Union representatives are typically highly respected members of labor organizations and typically enjoy excellent job stability. With the knowledge of labor laws and regulations, they can help secure better working conditions and benefits for the members of their labor unions.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2965467}

It later passed into the ownership of Farrell's grandson, Norman Hale, and has been used as a cattle ranch ever since. The headquarters is located in Harshaw and includes multiple historic buildings, associated outbuildings, and building foundations.The most prominent of these is the James Finley House, a red brick and adobe structure originally used as the office for the Hermosa Mining Company. Because of its unusual construction—red bricks salvaged from a nearby mine—and its association with the early history of Harshaw, the James Finley House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.Another historic home located on the ranch is the Norman Hale Residence, an adobe house with a tin gabled roof, part of which dates back to the 1880s. Nearby is the Mary Hale Residence, another adobe house with a tin hipped roof, built around the same time as the others and locally referred to as the 'Lions Den'. Further down the road is the ruin of a third adobe building that was originally owned by Ignacio 'Nacho' Arias, who used it as his home and a pool hall.In addition to the old houses and outbuildings, there are the foundations of several historic structures. The most notable is that of the Hermosa Mill, which was originally built in the 1870s when mining operations began. Closer to the James Finley House is the concrete foundations of a two-room frame schoolhouse and a Catholic church built of volcanic tuff, both of which were built in the 1940s and torn down in the 1960s. A smaller rock alignment nearby was part of an assay office from the late 19th century.Two small cemeteries are also located in the area. The main cemetery to the north of the Hale Ranch headquarters and the townsite is known locally as the 'Mexican cemetery', because of the many Mexican-American pioneers buried in the cemetery. A short distance away is the 'American cemetery', which is located on private property and contains the graves of American pioneers, among them Richard Farrell.A few miles to the east of the Hale Ranch headquarters is another historic ranch house owned by the Hale family. Located along the San Rafael Valley road, the home was originally the headquarters for the Ernest Best Ranch, and was used as a filming location for several Western films. The opening scene of the 1971 made-for-television film 'Wild Rovers', starring William Holden and Ryan O'Neal, was shot in the living room of the ranch house.Photo gallerySee alsoSan Rafael RanchReferencesRanches in Arizona 1915 establishments in Arizona Buildings and structures in Santa Cruz County, Arizona", "machine_text": " Hale Ranch, located in the town of Vista, California, is a large property brimming with history and unique features.

It is endemic to New Zealand. It is classified as 'At Risk, Naturally Uncommon' by the Department of Conservation. This species is regarded as having two 'forms' although doubt has been expressed whether these are the same species.TaxonomyP. pyramidias was first described by Edward Meyrick in 1901 from a specimen collected by Alfred Philpott in Invercargill. George Hudson described and illustrated this species in his 1928 book The Butterflies and Moths of New Zealand. The holotype specimen is held at the Natural History Museum, London. The holotype represents P. pyramidias sensu stricto.DescriptionMeyrick originally described the species as follows: The holotype specimen described above is typical of the species from the type locality in that it has a drab appearance and is smaller than the form of the species existing in silver beech forest. The adults of this latter form are more brightly coloured and patterned. Doubt has been expressed whether this larger, more colourful form is the same species as the smaller, more drab form of this moth.DistributionThis species is endemic to New Zealand. It is found from the Bay of Plenty to Southland. The type locality is around Awarua Bog and Tiwai Point and this is where the smaller, more drab form of the species lives. This form has also been found at Whakarewarewa in Rotorua. The more colourful and patterned form of this species is found in the above stated range where its host plant is present.Biology and life cycleThis species is on the wing between October and February.Host plants and habitatThe host plant of the larvae of P. pyramidia in the type locality and the above-mentioned population in Rotorua is Leucopogon fasciculatus. The larger, more colourful and patterned form of this species has larvae that feed on Lophozonia menziesii. This host plant is absent from Invercargill and its surrounding area.Conservation StatusP. pyramidia s.s. has been classified as having the 'At Risk, Naturally Uncommon' conservation status under the New Zealand Threat Classification System.ReferencesMoths described in 1901 Archipini Moths of New Zealand Endemic fauna of New Zealand Endangered biota of New Zealand", "machine_text": " Pyrgotis pyramidias is a species of bee native to the Mediterranean region of the Middle East and North Africa. It is a relatively small and nondescript bee, but is of particular importance due to its role in pollination of the region's native vegetation. Pyrgotis pyramidias has a unique form of mating behavior, in which the female bee sets up a “trap line” of sorts by marking certain plants with secretions, or “traps”, that she sets up to attract potential mates. A prospective mate that lands on the trap emits a pheromone signal that is picked up by the female bee. She then responds to the signal by departing the trap in search of the mate. The bee frequents mostly barren and semi-arid areas with sparse vegetation, places where its main source of food comes from various species of euphorbia. It has also been observed foraging for other flowering plants nearby, such as crepe myrtle and nightshade. As a pollinator, Pyrgotis pyramidias has the important role of spreading the pollen from the native Mediterranean vegetation to the plant species near them. This helps to ensure a continual recruitment of new genetics in the vegetation, as well as increases its viability. The species is listed in the IUCN Red List as a species of least concern, though it is threatened by habitat loss and urbanization. As an important pollinator, conservation efforts should be taken to ensure that this species of bee is not lost. Apart from its important role in pollination, this species of bee has also been studied for its utility in certain industries. For instance, its use in producing cosmetic products (specifically, wax production) due to its particularly abundant wax producing glands, has been explored. In addition, it has been studied in beekeeping to determine its 'frugality' which has the potential to increase honey production. Overall, Pyrgotis pyramidias is a small but important species of bee that plays a huge role in maintaining the Mediteranean region’s native vegetation. Continued study of the bee is important not only to ensure its continued survival, but also to help us gain a better understanding of the region’s local ecology.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 43870692}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Tribe of Dan\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Tribe of Dan (), meaning, 'Judge', was one of the tribes of Israel, according to the Torah. They were allocated a coastal portion of land when the people of Israel entered the Promised Land, later moving northwards.Biblical narrativeIn the Biblical census of the Book of Numbers, the tribe of Dan is portrayed as the second largest Israelite tribe (after Judah). Some textual scholars regard the census as being from the Priestly Source, dating it to around the 7th century BC, and more likely to reflect the biases of its authors. In the Blessing of Moses, which some textual scholars regard as dating from only slightly earlier than the deuteronomist, Dan is prophesied to 'leap from Bashan'; scholars are uncertain why this should be since the tribe did not live in the Bashan plain, east of the Jordan River.Conquest and territory According to the biblical narrative, following the completion of the conquest of Canaan by the Israelite tribes after about 1200 BCE, Joshua allocated the land among the twelve tribes. Dan was the last tribe to receive its territorial inheritance. The land originally allocated to Dan was a small enclave in the central coastal area of Canaan, between Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim and the Philistines.To the north the territory of Dan abutted Joppa, the modern Jaffa. This territory, not very extensive originally, was soon diminished by its dangerous neighbors, the Philistines. The tribe was only able to camp in the hill country overlooking the Sorek Valley, the camp location becoming known as Mahaneh Dan ('Camp of Dan'). () The region they were trying to settle extended south into the Shephelah in the area of Timnah; as a result, the modern state of Israel refers to the region as Gush Dan (the Dan area).From after the conquest of the land by Joshua until the formation of the first united Kingdom of Israel in c. 1050 BC, the Tribe of Dan was a part of a loose confederation of Israelite tribes. No central government existed, and in times of crisis the people were led by ad hoc leaders known as Judges.The most celebrated Danite was Samson, a Danite judge from the period of settlement in the lands allotted by Joshua. Pnina Galpaz-Feller sees similarities between the story of Samson and Denyen tribal legends. Excavations conducted at Tel Dan by Dr. David Ilan of the Hebrew Union College, show support for the Danites' potential Aegean connections.As a consequence of the pressure from the Philistines, a portion of the tribe abandoned hopes of settling near the central coast, instead migrating to the north of Philistine territory, and after conquering Laish, refounded it as the city of Dan (). Thus their territory in the end lay northeast of that of Naphtali, east of the upper Jordan River, near its eastern sources, and defining the northern extent of the land of the Israelites. A number of biblical texts thus refer to 'All Israel, from Dan to Beersheba'.United Monarchy With the growth of the threat from Philistine incursions, the Israelite tribes decided to form a strong centralised monarchy to meet the challenge, and the Tribe of Dan joined the new kingdom with Saul as the first king. After the death of Saul, all the tribes other than Judah remained loyal to the House of Saul.But after the death of Ish-bosheth, Saul's son and successor to the throne of Israel, the Tribe of Dan joined the other northern Israelite tribes in making David, who was then the king of Judah, king of a re-united Kingdom of Israel. The tribe provided substantial military support for the kingdom in the form of 28,600 soldiers, being considered 'experts in war'.Northern Kingdom of Israel However, on the accession of Rehoboam, David's grandson, in c. 930 BC the northern tribes split from the House of David to re-form a Kingdom of Israel as the Northern Kingdom.Assyrian conquest and demise As part of the Kingdom of Israel, the territory of Dan was conquered by the Assyrians, and exiled; the manner of their exile led to their further history being lost.Claims of descent from Dan A 15th-century Latin chronicle, 'Chronicon Holsatiae vetus', found in Gottfried Leibniz's Accessiones historicae (1698),states the Danes were of the Tribe of Dan. The antiquarian Henry Spelman in 1620 had made a similar claim that the Danes were the Israelite Tribe of Dan, based on the apparent similarity in name. Additionally, proponents ofNordic and British Israelism have made similar claims about descent from the tribe of Dan. British Israelite authors such as John Cox Gawler and J. H. Allen identified the Tribe of Dan with Denmark. While another prominent British Israelite author, Edward Hine, took the view that the tribe of Dan had originated in Denmark and then migrated to the British Isles.Some Ethiopian Jews, also known as Beta Israel, claim descent from the Tribe of Dan, whose members migrated south along with members of the tribes of Gad, Asher, and Naphtali, into the Kingdom of Kush, now Ethiopia and Sudan, during the destruction of the First Temple. This position is supported by former Sephardic Chief Rabbi Ovadia Yosef. They are said to have fought with the natives. Charles Upton relates the serpent Haitian Vodou (voodoo) God Danbhala as derived in part from a heterodox form of Ethiopian Judaism, despite the Africans in Haiti deriving from West Africa, not Ethiopia.Characteristics Their primary trade characteristic was seafaring, unusual for the Israelite tribes. In the Song of Deborah the tribe is said to have stayed on their ships with their belongings.IconographyModern artists use the 'scales of justice' to represent the Tribe of Dan due toreferencing Dan 'shall achieve justice for his kindred'. More traditional artists use a snake to represent Dan, based upon Genesis 49:17, 'Let Dan be a serpent by the roadside, a horned viper by the path, That bites the horse's heel, so that the rider tumbles backward.'Book of Revelation Revelation 7:4–8 mentions that people from the twelve tribes of Israel will be sealed. The selection of the twelve tribes does not include the names of Ephraim and Dan, although their names were used for the twelve tribes that settled in the Promised Land. It has been suggested that this could be because of their pagan practices. This led Irenaeus, Hippolytus of Rome and some Millennialists to propose that the Antichrist will come from the tribe of Dan.See alsoBook of JudgesBritish IsraelismDan (biblical figure)DenyenNordic IsraelismTen Lost TribesReferencesExternal linksDan, Tribe of DenyenDanish people", "machine_text": " The Tribe of Dan (Hebrew: דָּן‎) was one of the Twelve Tribes of Israel. It is believed to be named after the grandson of Jacob and Leah. They were divided into two divisions, which became known as Danites and Danessites. The Tribe of Dan is mentioned in the Books of Numbers and Joshua. The Tribal Territory of Dan initially included the Eastern Shore of the Mediterranean Sea. This included the cities of Zorah, Timna, and its two associated cities, Dan, and Eltekeh. This area was later taken from the tribe of Dan and given to the tribe of Judah. The Tribe of Dan is associated with Judges chapter 18, in which the Danites are said to have gone against the commandment of God by stealing the shrine of the Micos and bringing it back to their home in Laish. This is said to have angered God, and He gave the Danites over to the Philistines. The Tribe of Dan is traditionally associated with ships. Their navy is said to have roamed the Mediterranean and traveled to far-away lands. Some believe that the Tribe of Dan was comprised of traders and merchants, while others believe they were skilled sailors. The Tribe of Dan is also associated with two Judges in the Bible: Samson and Eli. They both held the position of the High Priest and judge of the Israelites. Samson is said to have been chosen because of his strength and power. It is believed to have been his strength and courage that enabled him to fight and defeat the Philistines. Some believe that the Tribe of Dan was no longer politically strong after a civil war in the 7th century BC. It is believed that due to the lack of leadership and unity, the Tribe of Dan was broken away from the twelve tribes and did not regain its strength until the 12th century AD. Today, there are several Jewish organizations and communities that identify as the Tribe of Dan, bearing their name as a reminder of their connections to the ancient Israelites and their descendants. There are also Christian organizations that look to their shared faith as a reminder of their shared connection as Israelites, wherever they may be today.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 332563}

The film is set in feudal Japan and stars Hibari Misora as Oko and Denjirô Ōkōchi as Taro Takai. The film's story follows the lives of Oko, a peasant girl who was adopted by a family in a Japanese village, and Taro Takai, the ruthless master of the estate. Along with other villagers, they face the oppression of their landowner and the villagers’ growing discontent with the situation. The film’s main characters and events are based on the true story of a peasant rebellion in the town of Ikata during the Meiji period in Japan. The story focuses onOkos’ and Taro’s oppression of the villagers and their gradual rise to power as they fight against their historical oppressors. During the film, the villagers strive to protect their land and fight valiantly against Taro and his armies. While the battle is ultimately unsuccessful, the film ends with Oko’s spirit being seen as a sign that the villagers will never be conquered. The film was well-received by both critics and audiences and was selected as part of New Crowned Hope, a milestone collection of 67 classic films from around the world, to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the birth of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The film was released by Nikkatsu on 24 December 1949 in Japan-wide circulation. It is considered to be one of the most important films of the jidaigeki genre.

The habitat is forest and dense agricultural land.Adults mimic distasteful day-flying moths. Both sexes have been recorded feeding from the secretions of the Auchenorrhyncha species that the larvae feed on.The larvae are carnivorous. They feed on Auchenorrhyncha species belonging to the families Cicadellidae and Membracidae, including Leptocentrus altifrons, Anchon relatum, Gargara variegata and Nehela ornata. They creep up on their prey, periodically stopping and vibrating the true legs. On reaching the prey, the legs are vibrated on the closed wings of their target, much as the tending ants do with their antennae. The larva then raises its body over the cicadellid, then drops onto it, grasping it with its true legs.The prey is killed by a bite to the back of the neck, then completely consumed, the legs of the larva aiding in holding the prey and guiding the prey to its mouth. The larvae are dark brown. They are associated with the ant species Pheidole aurivillii race kasaiensis and Camponotus akwapimensis var. poultoni.ReferencesExternal links Seitz, A.

Plate XIII 65 fButterflies described in 1851 Miletinae", "machine_text": " Megalopalpus zymna, also known by its common name, the yellow-headed beer moth, is a species of moth belonging to the family Crambidae. It is found across much of the Palearctic ecozone, ranging from parts of Europe to Central Asia and Siberia. It is particularly common in Central Europe, most notably in Germany and Austria. M. zymna moths typically measure between 14 and 18 mm in length, and feature a distinctive yellow head and base of the antennae. Their wings are a rich orange chestnut color, marked with some darker shading around the edges. On either side of the wings, a white, 'L-shaped' pattern is visible, but more prominent in the males than in the females. The larvae of M. zymna feed on a variety of grasses and cereals, although they are most commonly found on barley and wheat. Additionally, they can be found on the leaves and stems of other cereal plants, such as oats, rye and maize. In Germany, the larvae are an important pest species, and considerable damage can be done to agricultural fields and grain stores. Adult M. zymna are typically active between June and October in most regions, although they can sometimes be found earlier in the season in southern parts of their range. After mating, the females lay their eggs on the leaves and stems of cereal plants, and the larvae emerge after around two weeks. They feed for approximately six weeks before pupating, developing into adult moths shortly afterwards. The larvae are subject to natural predators, including the predaceous midge Tanytarsus lateralis, which feeds exclusively on M. zymna larvae. Additionally, a number of parasitoid wasps, such as Oomyzus sokolowskii and Microplitis mediator, have been identified as natural enemies of the species. As a result of such natural control, large-scale population outbreaks of M. zymna are relatively rare. The species has also been known to be controlled through the usage of chemical pesticides, but more often by the destruction of crop residues and good hygiene practices, such as the removal of infested plant material from the fields. Biological control has also been employed in some areas, with various species of Trichogramma wasps being released to reduce the population size of M. zymna. In addition to its agricultural pest status, M. zymna is also regarded as an important pollinator species in many parts of Europe, pollinating cereal crops such as barley and wheat.This valuable role in crop production is generally overlooked, due to the species' status as an agricultural pest. Today, Megalopalpus zymna continues to be an important species in many areas across the Palearctic ecozone, with its agricultural pest status tightly intertwined with its role as a valuable crop pollinator. Despite the potential damage it can cause to cereal crops, the species remains an invaluable part of the region's ecosystem, and should be respected accordingly.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Blue iguana\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The blue iguana (Cyclura lewisi), also known as the Grand Cayman ground iguana, Grand Cayman blue iguana or Cayman Island rock iguana, is an endangered species of lizard which is endemic to the island of Grand Cayman. It was previously considered to be a subspecies of the Cuban iguana, Cyclura nubila, but in a 2004 article Frederic J. Burton reclassified it as a separate species because according to him the genetic differences discovered four years earlier between the different C. nubila populations warranted this interpretation. The blue iguana is one of the longest-living species of lizard (possibly up to 69 years).The preferred habitat for the blue iguana is rocky, sunlit, open areas in dry forests or near the shore, as the females must dig holes in the sand to lay eggs in June and July. A possible second clutch is laid in September. The blue iguana's herbivorous diet includes plants, fruits, and flowers. Its color is tan to gray with a bluish cast that is more pronounced during the breeding season and more so in males. It is large and heavy-bodied with a dorsal crest of short spines running from the base of the neck to the end of the tail.The iguana was possibly abundant before European colonization; but fewer than 15 animals remained in the wild by 2003, and this wild population was predicted to become extinct within the first decade of the 21st century. The species' decline is mainly being driven by predation by cats and dogs, and indirectly by reduction in suitable habitat as fruit farms are converted to pasture for cattle grazing. Since 2004, hundreds of captive-bred animals have been released into a preserve on Grand Cayman run by a partnership headed by the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, in an attempt to save the species. At least five non-profit organizations are working with the government of the Cayman Islands to ensure the survival of the blue iguana.Taxonomy Its specific name lewisi commemorates the name of the scientist who collected the holotype of this species, Charles Bernard Lewis.The closest relatives are the Cuban iguana (Cyclura nubila) and the Northern Bahamian rock iguana (C. cychlura). It can be genetically distinguished from the subspecies found on Little Cayman and Cayman Brac known as C. nubila caymanensis, although it can interbreed with this subspecies and produce fertile offspring.In 1938 Lewis of the Institute of Jamaica joined an Oxford University biological expedition to the Cayman Islands. Lewis obtained two blue iguanas, a male and a female, which were later lodged with the Natural History Museum, London. Chapman Grant, in an article published in 1940, formally described the blue iguana as an separate taxon for the first time, classifying it as the trinomial C. macleayi lewisi. Albert Schwartz and Richard Thomas reclassified it as C. nubila lewisi in 1975, making it a subspecies of the Cuban iguana. In his 2004 article Frederick Burton repeatedly states Schwartz and Carey reclassified it in a 1977 publication, but he is mistaken.Burton, who runs the captive breeding program on the island, reclassified the blue iguana as a distinct species in 2004. Although it has almost identical head scale counts and patterns as C. nubila, most individuals of this taxon often have five auricular spines in as opposed to four in caymanensis, although this is not diagnostic, and individuals of the nominate subspecies shows either morphologies in similar proportions. Also most lewisi have an extra pair scales behind the prefrontals, although not always and individuals from the other populations may also have these. Thus Burton concluded that using scale characteristics these three taxa could not be told apart in a consistent manner. According to him most important difference between the lewisi population and the other two is skin color. Although skin color is a variable characteristic that is usually considered unsatisfactory in taxonomy, Burton thought that in this instance it might be appropriate. Although all three taxa hatch with the same color, as they grow older lewisi becomes more uniformly bluish, whereas the other taxa can be more variable in coloration, although Burton states that this characteristic is not reliable in many circumstances, such as rainy weather. Other reasons Burton gave for recognising lewisi as a separate species were geography, there is at least 108 kilometres separating the forms, which Burton then interpreted to mean that the populations were reproductively isolated, despite there being no reproductive barriers between the populations. Grant reported seeing caymanensis on Grand Cayman in 1940, but Burton states that this was likely a mistaken sighting made during rainy weather. Lastly Burton points to mitochondrial DNA analysis performed by Catherine Malone et al. in 2000; although the sample size was extremely small and there was some ambiguity, the different populations did have different haplotypes. Although Malone et al. found C. nubila sensu lato to be monophyletic, Burton claimed lewisi could be separated from the other two taxa without rendering C. nubila polyphyletic. Although none of this might be used to traditionally delineate a population as a species, he proposed using the 'general lineage concept' introduced by de Queiroz in 1998 to do so anyway.Common names This animal was originally called the Grand Cayman rock iguana, or Grand Cayman blue rock iguana. After separating this population taxonomically from the other Cayman Islands rock iguanas, Burton proposed a set of new vernacular names for the population in 2004: Grand Cayman blue iguana, Cayman blue iguana or for local colloquial use he proposed the simple abbreviated blue iguana.Note that the name 'blue iguana' is also used for bright blue forms of the green iguana, Iguana iguana.Description The blue iguana is the largest native land animal on Grand Cayman with a total nose-to-tail length ofand weighing as much as . This is among the largest species of lizard in the Western Hemisphere. The largest of the Cyclura, its body length iswith a tail equal in length. The blue iguana's toes are articulated to be efficient in digging and climbing trees. The mature male's skin color ranges from dark grey to turquoise blue, whereas the female is more olive green to pale blue. Young animals tend to be uniformly dark brown or green with faint darker banding. When they first emerge from the nest the neonates have an intricate pattern of eight dark dorsal chevrons from the crest of their necks to their pelvic area. These markings fade by the time the animal is one year old, changing to mottled gray and cream and eventually giving way to blue as adults. The adult blue iguana is typically dark gray matching the karst rock of its landscape. The animal changes its color to blue when it is in the presence of other iguanas to signal and establish territory. The blue color is more pronounced in males of the species. Their distinctive black feet stand in contrast to their lighter overall body color. The blue iguana's eyes have a golden iris and red sclera.Blue iguanas are sexually dimorphic; males are larger and have more prominent dorsal crests as well as larger femoral pores on their thighs, which are used to release pheromones. The male is larger than the female by one third of his body size.Distribution The blue iguana is endemic to the island of Grand Cayman. As of 2012 the population can be found throughout the island Grand Cayman excluding the urban areas of Bodden Town, Gun Bay, Seven Mile Beach and West Bay. One theory for how the taxon ended up on the island is that a single female Cuban iguana, C. nubila nubila, with eggs inside her drifted across the sea, perhaps during a storm. Sometimes the Lesser Caymans iguana, C. nubila caymanensis, has been found on Grand Cayman.EcologyHabitatThe blue iguana is found only on the island of Grand Cayman. Comparison with other Cyclura species in the region strongly suggests that there was once a coastal population of blue iguanas which was gradually displaced or extirpated by human settlements and the construction of roads. The blue iguana now only occurs inland in natural xerophytic shrubland and along the interfaces between farm clearings, roads, and gardens and closed-canopy dry forest or shrubland. The interior population is believed to have been attracted to agricultural clearings and fruit farms which provide thermoregulatory opportunities, herbaceous browse, fallen fruit, and nesting soil, but this brought the blue iguana into contact with humans and feral animals. Females often migrate to coastal areas to nest. Blue iguanas released into the Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park on Grand Cayman were radiotracked in 2004 to determine ranges for each animal. Females were found to occupy territories ofand males an average ofwith overlap in common territories, indicating that they choose to maintain a population density of four to five animals per hectare.The blue iguanas occupy rock holes and tree cavities, and as adults are primarily terrestrial. Although not known to be arboreal, it has been observed climbing treesand higher. Younger individuals tend to be more arboreal.Diet Like all Cyclura species, the blue iguana is primarily herbivorous, consuming leaves, flowers, and fruits from over 45 species of plant. The diet is very rarely supplemented with insects, crabs, slugs and fungi.Predators Hatchlings are preyed upon by the native snake Alsophis cantherigerus. The adults have no natural predators.Longevity Longevity in the wild is unknown but is presumed to be many decades. A blue iguana named 'Godzilla' captured on Grand Cayman in 1950 by naturalist Ira Thompson was imported to the United States in 1985 by Ramon Noegel and sold to reptile importer and breeder, Tom Crutchfield in 1990. Crutchfield donated Godzilla to the Gladys Porter Zoo in Brownsville, Texas in 1997 and the lizard remained there until its death in 2004. Thompson estimated Godzilla to be 15 years of age at the time of his capture. At an estimated 69 years of age (54 of which were spent in captivity), Godzilla may be the world's longest-living lizard for which there is reliable record. A closely related Lesser Caymans iguana (C. nubila caymanensis) has been documented as living 33 years in captivity.Reproduction Mating occurs from May through June. Copulation is preceded by numerous head-bobs on the part of the male, who then circles around behind the female and grasps the nape of her neck. He then attempts to restrain the female in order to manoeuvre his tail under hers to position himself for intromission (copulation). Copulation generally lasts from 30 to 90 seconds, and a pair is rarely observed mating more than once or twice a day. A clutch of anywhere from 1 to 21 eggs are usually laid in June or July depending on the size and age of the female, in nests excavated in pockets of earth exposed to the sun. Several exploratory nests are begun before one is completed. These burrows can range fromto overin length, with an enlarged chamber at its terminal portion to allow the female to turn around. The temperature within nests that have been monitored by researchers remained a constantthroughout the incubation period which ranges from 65 to 90 days. The blue iguana's eggs are among the largest laid by any lizard.Individuals are aggressively territorial from the age of about three months onward. They typically reach sexual maturity after four years of age in captivity.ConservationEndangered statusThe blue iguana is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List. In 1988 the British researcher Roger Avery spent two weeks on the island and only observed three animals. Surveys in 2003 indicated a total population in the range of 5–15 individuals. In 2006 the iguana was one of the most endangered lizards on Earth.Restored free-roaming subpopulations in the Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park and the Salina Reserve numbered approximately 125 individuals in total after an initial release in December 2005. The restored subpopulation in the Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park has been breeding since 2001, and the subpopulation in the Salina Reserve was deemed to be breeding in 2006 after a nest of three hatched eggs was discovered in the wild. In April 2007, after another large-scale release, there were 299 blue iguanas living in the wild, with hundreds more being raised in captivity on Grand Cayman. In late 2012, the blue iguana recovery program estimated that the wild population had risen to approximately 750 individuals, and the IUCN subsequently downlisted the species from critically endangered to endangered.International trade in the species is regulated due to its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.Causes of declineHabitat destruction is the main factor threatening extinction for this iguana. Land clearance within remnant habitat is occurring for agriculture, road construction, and real estate development and speculation. The conversion of traditional crop lands to cattle pasture is eliminating secondary blue iguana habitat.Predation and injury to hatchlings by rats, to hatchlings and sub-adults by feral cats, and killing of adults by pet dogs are all placing severe pressure on the remaining wild population. Automobiles and motorscooters are an increasing cause of mortality as the iguanas rarely survive the collisions. Trapping and shooting is a comparatively minor concern, and has stopped according to the IUCN in 2012, but before 1995 occasional trapping may have occurred.The common green iguana, (Iguana iguana), has been introduced from Honduras and is well-established on Grand Cayman as an invasive species. It far outnumbers the native blue iguana. No direct negative consequences on the blue iguana due to this introduction are known, but the mere presence of the green iguana confuses public attitudes and understanding. For example, the people of the island are told that blue iguanas are endangered and rare, but the green iguana looks very similar and are quite common in suburban areas.In 2008 six blue iguanas were found dead in the preserve within Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park on Grand Cayman. The iguanas were apparently killed by human vandals armed with knives and two of the slaughtered animals were gravid females about to lay eggs.The wild population of blue iguanas had been reduced from a near island-wide distribution to a non-viable, fragmented remnant. By 2001 no young hatched in the unmanaged wild population were surviving to breeding age, meaning the population was functionally extinct, with only five animals remaining in the wild.Recovery efforts In 1990, the American Zoo and Aquarium Association designated the genus Cyclura as their highest priority for conservation. Their first project was an in situ captive breeding program for the blue iguana.One of the early difficulties encountered was that the captive stock of the early 1990s was found not to be pure. It was discovered through DNA analysis that the captive population contained a number of animals that were hybrids with C. nubila caymanensis. These hybrids were sterilized by means of hemipenectomies so that the program contain only pure-breeds. This program was created to determine the exact genealogies of the limited gene pool of the remaining animals and DNA analysis revealed that the entire North American captive population was descended from a single pair of animals.As a hedge against disaster striking the blue iguana population on Grand Cayman, in 2004 an ex situ captive population was established in 25 zoos in the USA. A minimum of 20 founder lines represented by at least 225 individuals is being maintained by captive breeding and recorded in a studbook for the species by Tandora Grant of the San Diego Zoo's Center for Conservation and Research for Endangered Species. By 2002 the Indianapolis Zoo had success with breeding the blue iguana in captivity twice since the year 2000.In October 2006, hatchlings were released into the wild for the first time to boost the species and help bring them back from the brink of extinction. Each released blue iguana wears a string of colored beads through its nuchal crest for visual identification at a distance, backed up by an implanted microchip and a high-resolution photograph of its head scales. Head scale patterns are as unique among blue iguanas as fingerprints are among humans.The blue iguana is established in captivity, both in public and private collections. There are very few pure-bred animals in private collections, animals in captive breeding programs are often hybrids with the Lesser Caymans Iguana (C. nubila caymanensis) and occasional hybrids with the Cuban Iguana (C. nubila nubila). Breeding in the pet trade minimizes the demand for wild-caught specimens.Blue Iguana Recovery ProgrammeThe Blue Iguana Recovery Programme grew from a small project started in 1990 within the National Trust for the Cayman Islands. It is now a partnership, linking the Trust with the Cayman Islands Department of Environment, National Trust Cayman Islands, Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park, Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, International Reptile Conservation Foundation, IRCF, and the European Commission. This program operates under a special exemption from provisions in the Animals Law of the Cayman Islands, which normally would make it illegal for anyone to kill, capture, or keep iguanas. BIRP's conservation strategy involves generating large numbers of genetically diverse hatchlings, headstarting them for two years so that their chance of survival in the wild is high, and using these animals to rebuild a series of wild sub-populations in protected, managed natural areas. A rapid numerical increase from a maximum possible number of founding stock is sought to minimize loss of genetic diversity caused by a population bottleneck.Restored sub-populations are present in two non-contiguous areas —the Salina Reserve and the Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park. Habitat protection is still vital, as the Salina Reserve has onlyof dry shrubland, which is not enough to sustain the 1,000 blue iguanas that were planned to be restored to the wild. The 2001 plan called for additional sub-populations to be restored in one or more other areas. When the wild sub-populations have reached the carrying capacity of their respective protected areas, release of head-started animals will be phased out.The overall captive population is likely to remain genetically fragmented in the long term. To maintain gene flow, individuals should be translocated between zoos.According to the 2001 plan, breeding of blue iguanas in the wild will require indefinite future management. To sustain this activity, a range of commercial activities was hoped to generate the required funding. An education and awareness effort in 2007 was meant to ensure local involvement and support.In April 2019, one iguana laid 18 eggs for possible hatching. Any survivals will be the first successful breeding since 2015. In 2018, seven eggs were laid but none hatched.ReferencesExternal linksBlue Iguana Recovery Program (B.I.R.P.)International Reptile Conservation FoundationThe National Trust for the Cayman Islands, the B.I.R.P's parent organizationInternational Iguana FoundationCyclura Endemic fauna of the Cayman Islands Reptiles described in 1940 Taxa named by Chapman Grant Endangered fauna of North America", "machine_text": " The blue iguana (Cyclura lewisi), also known as the Grand Cayman iguana or Grand Cayman blue iguana, is an endangered species of lizard that is native to the Cayman Islands. It is the largest native land animal in the Caribbean and is one of the longest-lived species of land reptiles in the world, capable of surviving up to 75 years in captivity. Morphologically, the blue iguana is distinguished from other species by its robust body shape and its blue dewlap, a large lobe of skin that hangs from its throat. Its dorsal and lateral scales are arranged in transverse rows, creating angular ridges that run the length of the body. Its tail is long and comprised of many overlapping scales. Its eyes are a deep orange color. The blue iguana is an important component of the stone forest, or dry coastal thicket, habitat type in which it is found. This habitat, found along the coasts of the Cayman Islands, is characterized by low shrubs, rocks, and cacti, and is favored by the iguana due to its sheltering thickets. The blue iguana is a herbivore, feeding mainly on flowers, fruits, leaves, and other vegetation. It is especially fond of algae, consuming it with its wide saliva-drenched tongue. They are diurnal, which means they are most active during the day, and they can often be observed sunning on rocks. The blue iguana population has been greatly reduced over the years due to the encroachment of humans on its habitat and its vulnerability to predation. It is listed as critically endangered on the IUCN red list, due mainly to its low reproductive rate and long-standing threats from habitat destruction and introduced predators such as cats and dogs. Conservation efforts are in place to protect the blue iguanas and its habitat. The Blue Iguana Recovery Program was created in 1990 and continues to work to save the species through captive breeding, habitat restoration, and public education. In 2014, a successful head-starting program was established, allowing for the juveniles to grow and mature in a semi-wild environment before being released into their natural habitat. The blue iguana is an iconic symbol of the Caribbean and is important to the Cayman Island's culture and identity. It is also treasured worldwide for its unique ecological role in the conservation of its threatened habitat.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1931416}

After his father's death in 1888, he moved to Scotland where he worked at a coal mine in Airdrie. In 1896 Small joined the Airdrie Miners' Union and quickly became a prominent leader in the organization, eventually becoming the union's president in 1912. He rose to prominence in the Scottish trade union movement during this time and was a founding member of the coal miners' union in Leeds. He became politically active in 1900 when he was elected as a member of the Harmony and Progress Party, a local socialist party. He was the selected as a delegate to the annual congress of the Trade Union Congress in 1901. He was actively involved in the founding of the Labour Party and was elected onto their National Executive in 1906. From 1908 to 1909, Small held the position of General Secretary of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain. He was an unrelenting advocate for improved working conditions and helped create the 1911 Mines Act, which introduced health and safety regulations in the mining industry. Small was a strong believer in the need for trade unions to become more politically involved in order to improve social and economic equality. His efforts towards this goal culminated with the creation of the Labour Representation Committee in 1906. The committee was created to secure the rights of working people and increase their representation in parliament. Small was instrumental in the formation of this committee and was elected to the executive board of the Labour Party in 1908, 1922 and 1923. Small also played an important role in the formation of the National Union of Railwaymen in 1913, which merged a number of major British railway unions into one. He served as the union's first president and continued in that role until his death. In 1925, he was appointed to the National Executive of the Trades Union Congress and was a key figure in the Parliament of Labour During the 1926 General Strike, Small worked diligently to support the league of strikers and was involved in fundraising efforts to help those affected by the strike.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Felling, Tyne and Wear\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Felling is an eastern suburb of Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, England. The town was formed when three villages coalesced in the 19th century. Historically part of County Durham, the town was subsumed into the metropolitan borough of Gateshead in 1974. It lies on the B1426 Sunderland Road and the A184 Felling bypass, less thaneast of Gateshead town centre,south east of Newcastle-upon-Tyne and 10 miles north west of the City of Sunderland. In 2011, Felling had a population of 8,908.The history of Felling stretches almost eight hundred years. The original manor at Felling was granted in the 13th century and passed through several families until it was passed to the Brandling family in 1509. While Lords of the Manor, several members of this family served as Members of Parliament among other civic duties. They were also instrumental in bringing heavy industry to the area, and Felling Colliery (John Pit), one of the oldest and largest collieries in the region, was developed on their estate. The colliery was the site of two mining disasters which cost over one hundred lives, helping prompt Sir Humphry Davy and George Stephenson to develop their safety lamps (there is a monument to the workers lost in St Mary's churchyard, Heworth). Other heavy industry took root in the 18th and 19th centuries so that Felling developed from a rural scattering of villages into firstly three distinct settlements at Low and High Felling and Felling Shore, then in 1894 these amalgamated with other local villages into the town of Felling, administered by the Felling Urban District Council at Sunderland Road. The areas that Felling council were responsible for were Felling, High Felling, Windy Nook, Whitehills Estate, Leam-Lane Estate, Pelaw, Wardley, Heworth, Bill Quay and Follingsby. The council was disbanded in 1974 when Felling was wholly incorporated into the new Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead.Felling today is broadly residential save some light industry located at the bank of the River Tyne in north Felling. It is governed locally and nationally by the Labour Party. The vast majority of residents identify as white British and, in the north areas particularly, there are high levels of unemployment and deprivation. It is well served by public transport; there are several bus services through the area and Felling lies on the Tyne and Wear Metro line and there are stations at Gateshead Stadium and Felling. Felling town centre remains the principal economic area and has recently benefitted from a £13.5 million regeneration project, with the demolition of the old Co-op supermarket and council building and rebuilding of the town shopping centre shopping units, which now run parallel to a new Asda superstore. The long and rich history of the area is reflected by over a dozen listed buildings, several churches and numerous public houses which are locally listed. It is served by several schools, though levels of educational qualification among residents are comparably low. Leisure provision is good, with four distinctive parks and various riverside facilities. Gateshead International Stadium lies in the area and several professional footballers hail from Felling, including former England international Chris Waddle, as does award-winning author David Almond.HistoryEarly historyThe name of Felling is recorded as early as 1217 and, in 1920, was said to refer to a clearing where woods and trees were felled. Since there are no other places in Britain which bear this name, despite country-wide tree felling, it is much more likely to be because it lies on the eastern descent of a Fell, which rises from Team Valley in the west to Low Fell, then still rising to High Fell, before descending down to the Tyne through Felling. Ing is a place name ending which means 'the people of'. In the 13th century, the Prior of Durham enfeoffed Sir Walter de Selby a manor at Felling 'to hold by homage, fealty, knights' service, two marks rent, and suit at the prior's every fortnight'. The estate then passed to Walter's son, Adam, whose own son forfeited the estate the manor upon his death, whereupon it was passed to Ralph de Applingden. In 1331, the manor was granted to Sir Thomas Surtees by Bishop Lewis Beaumont, who passed it to his son Alexander and whose own son, Thomas, inherited the estate in 1400 when he was only 20 weeks old. Thomas lived only 35 years, but is notable for having been High Sheriff of Northumberland in 1422. The estate continued to pass through the Surtees family until 1509, when the last surviving member of that family died.There followed a period of extensive litigation as the future of the considerable Surtees estate, which also included Low Dinsdale Manor near Darlington, was contested between the families Brandling, a staunchly Royalist and Catholic family, Blaxton and Wyclyffe. While several elements of the estate where divided by share, in 1509 the entire manor of Felling was granted by Deed of Partition to Robert Brandling and his heirs 'for life and to the total extinction' of any other claims.The Brandling familyBrandling duly lived at Felling with his wife Anne. He became sheriff of Newcastle-upon-Tyne in 1524, was mayor of Newcastle five times and was knighted by the Duke of Somerset at Mussleburgh. When he died in 1568, the estate passed to his brother Thomas. In 1605, Thomas' grandson, Robert Brandling, inherited the manor. Robert Brandling was granted Newminster Abbey by King James in 1610, served as High Sheriff of Northumberland in 1617 and was in 1621 elected Member of Parliament for Morpeth. When he died in 1636, the estate passed to his son, Sir Francis Brandling. Francis was also an MP, albeit for Northumberland, between 1624 and 1625 though he abandoned Felling in favour of residence at Alnwick Abbey. He died in 1641 and was succeeded by Charles Brandling, a cavalry colonel who also resided at both Felling and Alnwick. Charles had two brothers. The older of which, Ralph, was killed at the Battle of Marston Moor, while the second brother, Robert, also participated in the English Civil War and was captured in an otherwise successful Royalist engagement at Corbridge in February 1644 after which he switched sides and fought for the Roundheads; an action which earned him the reputation as 'a very knave' which he carried until his death in 1669.Early industrialisation 1680–1800By the turn of the 18th century, Felling consisted of little more than the large Brandling estate and a small scattering of tiny farming villages. However, Ralph Brandling, the incumbent of the Brandling estate at that time, had come to realise the value of the rich coal deposits on his estate and began drift mining around 1670. He initially found the large coal seams under his estate difficult to extract due to their depth, and indeed it was imported coal from Newcastle-upon-Tyne which saw the development of more extensive industries in salt, glass and chemicals which began to attract workers to the area. At around 1750, a large copper-works was opened at the banks of the River Tyne; the first such works to be developed on the river. Encouraged by these developments, Ralph Brandling's son, Charles Brandling, firstly commissioned more extensive mining of near-surface coal on his estate and then, encouraged by the discovery of several strata below his estate, began boring operations in 1758 to allow ultimately for deeper coal extraction. The result was the opening of Felling Colliery in 1779, working on the High Main stratum at a depth of 125 fathoms. A brown paper mill was also opened in 1798.Felling mining disastersOn 19 January 1811, the original High Main seam at Felling Colliery was closed, but by that time the colliery had grown enormously.The colliery was deepened to reach the Low Main seam.Two shafts were provided: John Pit and William Pit.The Low Main and began operation in October 1810. Disaster struck Felling Colliery on 25 May 1812 when, despite the colliery containing the most up-to-date safety measures, firedamp ignited and at around 11.30 am, 'one of the most tremendous explosions in the history of coal mining took place'. Two explosions rocked the colliery, the blast appearing in both pits.A cloud of coal dust and debris over a radius of a mile and a half was ejected from the colliery. One account recalled:Immense quantities of dust and coal rose high into the air in an inverted cone...In the village of Heworth, this cloud caused a darkness like that of early twilight and covered the roads so thickly that the footsteps of passengers were deeply imprinted in it. As soon as the explosion was heard, wives and children of the workmen ran to the pit. Wildness and terror were pictured in every countenance. The crowd soon collected to several hundreds, some crying out for a husband, others for a parent or a son, and all affected by a mixture of horror, anxiety and grief.Following the first blast at 11:30, rescue attempts started at 12:15.At 14:00 the second blast occurred and no further rescues occurred.Some 29 men were saved, but the remaining 92 men and boys were killed.Two days later the decision was made to seal the colliery to starve the fire of oxygen.Just one year later, on 24 December 1813, a further catastrophe occurred:About half-past one o'clock on the morning, an explosion took place in Felling colliery, by which nine men and thirteen boys were hurried into eternity, several others severely burnt, and all the underground horses but one destroyed. The accident occurred at the time of calling course, or when one set of men were relieving another. Several of the morning shift men were standing round the mouth of the pit, waiting to go down, when the blast occurred, and the part who had just descended met it soon after they had reached the bottom of the shaft; these were most miserably burnt and mangled.The 200th anniversary of the first disaster was commemorated in Felling on 25 May 2012 by a parade from St Mary's Church at Heworth to the place of the entrance to the colliery at Mulberry Street.The Industrial RevolutionIn spite of the disaster, Felling continued to grow and by the time of the explosions the character of Felling had changed substantially. There now existed three distinct villages. Around two miles south east of Gateshead lay High Felling; a residential village in the township of Heworth which had attracted several Wesleyan and Methodist preachers. Slightly to the north lay Low Felling. This was a more heavily industrialised village, containing Felling colliery, a large chemical works and other manufacturers, though in 1834 it was noted that there also existed 'a few neat houses and many cottages for the colliery which, with small gardens attached, give an aspect of comfort to the village'. At the north and on the bank of the River Tyne, a populous manufacturing and trading village had developed known as Felling Shore, spreading across three miles of the bank of the Tyne. A Methodist church was built there in 1805. This was accompanied by several shops and four public houses frequented predominantly by seamen and workers at the adjacent quay, coal staithes and ship building works where vessels of excellent quality were built. Industry continued to flourish here; the copperworks established in the 18th century still operated and had expanded, an oil and a paper mill had also developed, along with forging works for anchors and shovels.In 1827 the Friars Goose Chemical Works was opened by Anthony Clapham. In 1834 a second large chemical works was established by Hugh Lee Pattinson, John Lee and George Burnett; it soon employed around 300 men. Grindstone quarries produced high quality stone and a brownware pottery under Mr. Joseph Wood had opened for business. In 1842, Brandling Station was opened at Mullbery Street in Felling on the Brandling Junction railway linking Gateshead, South Shields and Sunderland. This is one of the oldest passenger stations in the world.By around 1870, Felling had reached its industrial peak. Historian John Marius Wilson noted:FELLING, a large village and a chapelry in Jarrow parish, Durham. The village stands on the Northeastern railway, 1½ mile SE of Gateshead; increased recently from two hamlets to its present condition; is maintained by factories and by mining operations; connects with Felling-Shore, a coal-shipping place on the Tyne; and has a post-office under Gateshead, a r. station, a church built in 1866, four dissenting chapels, and a Roman Catholic chapel. The chapelry was constituted in 1866. Population 5,105. The living is a vicarage. Value, £300. Patrons, Five Trustees.1870 – present dayThe industrial heights proved reasonably short-lived. By 1860, improvements to access along the River Tyne only served to highlight the better sites on the Tyne bank and so shipbuilding at Felling Shore began to decline. This decline was hastened by the limited space at Felling dock, which could not reasonably be extended and so progress enjoyed elsewhere was never matched at Felling. At around the same time, the chemical industry began to stall as bigger and more efficient competitors overtook their Felling counterparts. The industrial decline was matched by continuous residential growth, so that by the Victorian era those industrial elements which survived were met by a large sprawl of housing from the south where High and Low Felling had effectively merged.At 10:52 am on 26 March 1907, an express passenger train travelling from Heworth signal box derailed on the approach to Felling station. The cause was a combination of a sharp frost in the morning and unseasonal heat later in the day which saw the track expand and kink. The derailment, which saw all bar two carriages rolled over entirely, cost two passengers their lives, with eight more seriously hurt and a further 34 suffering minor injuries such as shock.The decline of heavy industry, meanwhile, continued apace. In 1932 the large chemical works at Felling Shore closed and was left derelict, leaving behind a 2 million tonne heap of spoil. Felling Colliery, the oldest and most extensive of all Felling's industry, had changed hands numerous times after the Brandlings finally sold their stake in the 1850s and ultimately closed in 1931 with the loss of 581 jobs. Fairs boat yard at Felling Shore had been sold in 1919 and became Mitchison's ship yard, but this too closed in 1964.In place of industry came housing. The high density terraced housing which had accompanied the industrial boom of the 19th century had sprawled south and was soon joined by a wave of development at the run of the 20th century.The earlier housing came at Stuart Street, Temple Street and Helmsdale Avenue in the form of Tyneside flats. In the inter-war years, whole derelict industrial areas were cleared and large council estates of semi-detached houses, with front and back gardens, were built at the Old Fold, Stoneygate, Brandling and Nest estates. By the time that Felling ceased to be an independent town and was incorporated into the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead in 1974, Felling had become a 'dormitory area' and remains so today.EconomyThere are two principal economic areas in Felling.

He played in Major League Baseball as a left-handed pitcher between 1898 and 1919. After the 1919 season he continued to make periodic appearances as a pinch hitter for many years, until his final game at the age of 57. As a player, Altrock was a member of two World Series winning teams and then, won a third World Series as a coach. He was a coach for the Washington Senators for many years.Biography Altrock was born in Cincinnati, to German immigrant parents. He was one of the better pitchers in baseball for a brief period fromtowith the Chicago White Sox. He was instrumental in the White Sox World Series championship in 1906, going 20–13 with a 2.06 ERA in the regular season and 1–1 with a Series-best 1.00 ERA against the Chicago Cubs.An arm injury after 1906 ruined his career, but he hung on with the White Sox and Washington Senators until , though he pitched very little afterand made sporadic pinch-hitting appearances after that, including one in(facing Rube Walberg of the Philadelphia Athletics) at 57 years of age. He appeared in major league games in five decades, one of only two players to do this (Minnie Miñoso is the other); he is one of only 29 players in baseball history to have appeared in major league games in four decades.Altrock became a coach for the Senators inand remained on the Washington staff through , a 42-year skein that represents the longest consecutive-year tenure of a coach with the same franchise in baseball history. Some Senator scorecards continued to list Altrock as a 'coach emeritus' even after his formal retirement.During that time, he was noted for his antics in the coaching box and teamed with Al Schacht, the 'Clown Prince of Baseball', for a dozen years to perform comedy routines on baseball fields in the days before official mascots. Schacht and Altrock also took their antics to the vaudeville stage where they appeared in a comedy routine. Ironically, at the height of their collaboration, Schacht and Altrock developed a deep personal animosity and stopped speaking with each other off the field. During their famous comic re-enactments of the Dempsey–Tunney championship boxing match, many speculated that they pulled no punches as they rained blows on each other.An anecdote, probably apocryphal, has been printed in some baseball books about a quip by Altrock during his coaching days with the Senators. A batter had hit a ball into the stands and it was not known whether it was fair or foul. The umpire, who had been the target of Altrock's gibes, made the call and shortly afterward a woman was carried from the stands on a litter. The umpire asked Altrock if the ball had hit the woman. In his clear voice, Nick answered, 'No. You called that one right and she passed out from shock.'He was the second oldest position player to play in a major league game when he played in 1924 at the age of 47.Altrock lived for many years in the Columbia Heights neighborhood of Washington, D.C., with his wife Eleanor, and died at age 88 in 1965. He is interred at Vine Street Hill Cemetery in Cincinnati.See alsoNick Altrock: A Columbia Heights Major Leaguer - Ghosts of DC List of Major League Baseball players who played in four decadesReferencesFurther reading Altrock Wasn't Always A Clown; Was Great Pitcher, by Harry Grayson, June 20, 1943External links, or Baseball Almanac, or Retrosheet1876 births 1965 deaths 19th-century baseball players American people of German descent Baseball coaches from Ohio Baseball players from Cincinnati Boston Americans players Burials at Vine Street Hill Cemetery Chicago White Sox players Columbus Senators players Grand Rapids Cabinet Makers players Grand Rapids Furniture Makers players Kansas City Blues (baseball) players Los Angeles Angels (minor league) players Louisville Colonels players Major League Baseball pitchers Major League Baseball pitching coaches Milwaukee Brewers (minor league) players Minneapolis Millers (baseball) players Navy Midshipmen baseball coaches Oswego Grays players Springfield Wanderers players Syracuse Stars (minor league baseball) players Toronto Royals players Vaudeville performers Washington Senators (1901–1960) coaches Washington Senators (1901–1960) players", "machine_text": " Nicholas Raymond Altrock (born June 8, 1876 - December 14, 1965) was an American left-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball (MLB). He was also an occasional first baseman and long-time coach for the Washington Senators/Minnesota Twins franchises. Altrock was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on June 8, 1876. He made his big-league debut with the Chicago Orphans in 1898 and spent four seasons with them before spending 1899 with the Louisville Colonels and 1901 with the Cincinnati Reds. In 1902 he joined the Washington Senators for a nine-season tenure with the club as a player/coach, during which he led the American League in ERA (earned run average) in 1907 and established himself as one of the game's humorous characters. He also managed 13 games for the Senators in 1910, compiling a 5-8 record. After completing his initial major-league career with the Boston Rustlers of the National League in 1914, Altrock returned to his old club in 1915 as a coach, becoming the long-time assistant to Senators/Twins manager Bucky Harris—except for a two-year stint as Miami Marlins manager in the Florida State League (1939-1940). His mediocre record as a major-league manager was due in part to the fact that he had no real coaching experience, despite working for many years as an assistant. altrock Altrock was also an accomplished artist, for which the sports world is thankful. The room in which the Washington Senators hosted their post-game banquetsused his cartoon artwork to adorn the walls. He was also a great practical joker, so much so that Sport Magazine named him 'king of clowns' in 1941. Nick Altrock was so popular in Washington, D. C., that Congress granted him a 1,000 salary in recognition of his services to the game. Altrock decided to return to the Senators in 1921 and spend the rest of his life in D. C. After 54 years as a coach and an additional 14 years as a scout, he retired from the Twins organization in 1969 at the age of 93. On December 14, 1965, Altrock died of a heart attack at age 89 in a Washington hospital. He was posthumously elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2005 with the Veterans Committee award. Altrock is the only person in baseball history to address the crowd at the Hall of Fame induction ceremony. He was inducted in 1947 and told the audience, 'It is a great honor to be here today. I'm glad I made it.' Although he did not personally receive the award, he was honored posthumously.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 938001}

In this future era, Buck travels all across the cosmos, taking part in thrilling adventures while fighting off all sorts of deadly aliens and villains. The Buck Rogers comic strip ran in newspapers all over the United States and Canada throughout its entire 46-year run.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Singapore Dreaming\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Singapore Dreaming is a 2006 Singaporean drama film. It follows the Loh family, a typical Singaporean working-class family, through their aspirations and dreams for a better and affluent life and the reality that would make it difficult for them to fulfill these aspirations.The film is inspired by a 2000 Singaporean essay titled Paved with Good Intentions, that the writers of the film had written for the Singapore International Foundation. A concatenation of e-mails Singaporeans sent to writers Colin Goh and Woo Yen Yen on their life stories in relation to the Singaporean dream eventually led them to write, produce and direct Singapore Dreaming. The film stars Richard Low as Poh Huat, Alice Lim as Siew Luan, Serene Chen as Irene, Yeo Yann Yann as Mei, Lim Yu-Beng as CK and Dick Su as Seng.The film was theatrically released on 7 September 2006, and at one time ranked fifth on the Singaporean box office. It has been acclaimed as one of the best Singaporean films of the 2000s. It won the Montblanc New Screenwriters Award at the 54th San Sebastián International Film Festival, and was the first such Singaporean film to receive an IFFPA-recognised international feature film award. Owing to its nature as a local film, Singapore Dreaming received much attention from Singaporean viewers, film critics and public figures alike, including S. R. Nathan, the then President of Singapore. It has been praised by local critics as a relatable portrayal of working-class life in Singapore.Plot Poh Huat (Richard Low), the father of the Loh family, works as a lawyer's clerk. He is married to Siew Luan (Alice Lim), a housewife who likes to brew liang teh (herbal tea) for the family. Poh Huat has a habit of buying lottery tickets in hope of winning and enjoying a better life. He also keeps newspaper cuttings of car models and condominiums and stores them in a box in his room.The family has one son, Seng (Dick Su), and one daughter, Mei (Yeo Yann Yann). Despite Mei's superior academic performance, the family has consistently shown favouritism for Seng. Even though he was ostensibly the academically poorer sibling, dropping out of school in Secondary 3, his parents still chose to fund his overseas polytechnic education instead of furthering his sister's education. Seng is due to return after two years at Dubois Polytechnical University (at Idaho). To fund his overseas studies, he had to borrow extra money from his fiancée, Irene (Serene Chen), who stays with Seng's parents.Mei works as a secretary who maintains a friendly working relationship with her boss. She is due for delivery in two months' time, and for maternity leave in a month's time. Her husband, Chin Keong (Lim Yu-Beng), quit his job in the Singapore Armed Forces a month before and is now selling insurance, though unsuccessfully. He is therefore belittled by Mei. Even though they cannot afford it, they frequently go to a condominium showroom to take a look, revealing their aspirations for a more luxurious lifestyle.Seng returns from the United States. Tensions escalate in the family between Mei and Seng, due to the family's apparent favouritism for Seng. Seng goes for several job interviews, but is unsuccessful. He becomes immensely disappointed, and lies to his family about the sanguinity of his job prospects.Poh Huat strikes the Toto lottery, winning S2 million, and the family is ecstatic. Seng decides that he wants to try starting a business. He gains his father's approval, who gives him effectively unlimited funding through a credit card. Seng also buys a car, without Irene's knowledge. Irene is infuriated when she learns Seng has been overspending without working first.Initially thrilled by his sudden elevation to the higher social class, Poh Huat dies suddenly of a heart attack while he was at a country club for a membership interview. Siew Luan goes into shock. At the funeral, Seng quarrels with Mei over the funeral expenses. Mei vents her anger on Chin Keong, who shows his displeasure by throwing the carton of drinks on the floor and storming off. Mei is called back to work one afternoon, even though she is still managing the funeral. Chin Keong expresses his outrage at this unreasonable request, but Mei says out of frustration, 'Singapore is like that, everywhere is like that, do we have a choice?' and returns to work. At work, Mei's boss, frustrated at the incapable temporary secretary, vents his anger at Mei and demands her to photocopy a stack of documents and brew coffee for him. Mei flips at the triviality of the task.Back at the funeral, Mei realizes that S500 has gone missing from the pek kim, and wrongly accuses her Filipino maid, Pinky, of stealing the money. Chin Keong reveals shortly after that the money is actually with him. Pinky, indignant at the wrong accusation, spits at Mei. Chin Keong goes to a nearby coffee shop for a drink. A beer girl from Mainland China approaches him at his table to talk to him, and Chin Keong ends up confiding his worries about life. The girl notes, 'You Singaporeans are always complaining. Do you think your life is tough?'. During the funeral wake, Seng reveals to his family that he did not graduate. Initially unbeknownst to him, Irene is standing nearby at the door, and hears his confession. Irene is greatly disappointed with Seng, and resolves to leave him.A few months later, Chin Keong, Seng and Mei, with her newly-born son, are called to a lawyer's office. It is revealed that Poh Huat's will has been found (made before either of them are born): he had left all his assets to his wife Siew Luan. However, the family has chalked up a debt of S800,000 in sending Seng overseas. Siew Luan is absent from the meeting, so the lawyer announces that, of the remaining S1, 200,000, Mei is getting S300,000, while Seng is getting S1,000. At the movie's end, Siew Luan hands some money over to Poh Huat's mistress and illegitimate son in a show of benevolence, and leaves Seng. Irene decides to go abroad to pursue a degree in photography.Cast A team of local actors composed the cast for Singapore Dreaming. Some casting decisions were made when the producers were penning the script in New York while others were made in Singapore.The characters of the film were based on the experiences of the people around the writers, that of the writers themselves, and on the e-mail responses that they received to their essay.Richard Low as Poh Huat: MediaCorp actor Richard Low had a role in one of the MediaCorp productions that was filming during the time Singapore Dreaming was set to film. However, he was not engaged as his character in that production was in coma. In the film, Poh Huat is the patriarch of the Loh family. He persistently favours and sides with his son, Seng over his daughter, Mei. Like the rest of the family, he yearns for a better life and, in particular, for a car and a country club membership. Alice Lim as Siew Luan: Alice Lim was one of the actresses that were cast later. She is the first female MC for major events in Singapore, and used to be active in the 1970s. The directors admired her 'beautiful' delivery of Hokkien in the film. In the film, Siew Luan married Poh Huat when she was young and remained a housewife ever since. She is seen to brew bottles of herbal tea perpetually (for members of the family, who, except for Irene, tend to reject them). She shares part of her life story with the audience as the film concludes. Serene Chen as Irene: The producers had a good relationship with Serene Chen from their previous work together on an earlier production, 3Meals. They planned to cast Serene Chen early on, during the initial script-writing. In the film, Serene plays the live-in fiancée of Seng, Irene. Irene is deeply attached to Seng and hankers for a marriage with him in the beginning of the film. She, together with Poh Huat, funded his overseas studies. Irene is also very close to Siew Luan. Yeo Yann Yann as Mei: Although the producers were unacquainted with Yann Yann, they used her face as a reference when writing for the character, Mei. Back in Singapore, Yann Yann accepted their offer to cast as Mei. In the film, Mei is the underappreciated daughter of the family, married to CK, whom she occasionally henpecks. Indignant that Seng was sent overseas when she was the one whose academic performance was more distinguished, she bears a patent grudge against Seng. Lim Yu-Beng as CK: The part of CK was written for Lim Yu-Beng, who agreed to join the film's production. In the film, CK resigned as an army officer and turned to selling insurance, a career at which he does not appear to be successful. Dick Su as Seng: Dick Su was involved in the production only after Serene Chen brought him in. In the film, Seng is the son in the family, who failed in graduating from his overseas studies. There were times when he tries to convince his family, especially his father, that he can succeed in life. Unfortunately, his plans never seem to work out and he ends up disappointing the people around him.DevelopmentConceptionThe development of Singapore Dreaming began in 2000 when New York-based couple Colin Goh and Woo Yen Yen wrote an essay for Singaporeans Exposed, a publication to commemorate the Singapore International Foundation's ten-year anniversary. The 5200-word essay, Paved with Good Intentions, explained the difference between the Singapore Dream and the Singapore Plan, and discussed the source and fashion of many Singaporeans' aspirations.Paved with Good Intentions was later circulated round the Internet, where many Singaporeans read the essay.Confessional responses the couple received thereafter reached the hundreds. In a podcast with mrbrown, Woo explained the typical reader response was 'How is it that I now have a house, I now have a car, a job, why I am still unhappy?' The couple 'felt a responsibility to do something', which inspired them to write the film, the original working title of which was The 5Cs.ProductionThe film was a number of firsts in the film industry; Singapore Dreaming was the first Singaporean film to be digitally encoded and projected. It was also the first collaboration between Singaporean and New York film-makers; the Director of photography Martina Radwan, editor Rachel Kittner and sound designer Paul Hsu were based in New York, along with the production staff, while composer Sydney Tan was based in Singapore.Singapore Dreaming was an independent, low-budget production, costing only S800 000 in total to produce — 80", "machine_text": " Singapore Dreaming is a 2006 documentary film directed by Woo Yen Yen and Christine Molloy. The film documents the lives of ordinary Singaporeans in their everyday lives, showing how they strive to realise the dream of success in their society. It also follows a selection of individuals in their quest to achieve happiness and stability in a rapidly changing society. The film takes a look at the struggles of three generations of Singaporeans,uncovering the ever-changing dynamics between them as they grapple with the day-to-day realities of their lives from a range of perspectives. Singapore Dreaming is an observational film, looking at an exciting time in the history of the nation and exploring a variety of issues such as immigration, housing and the socioeconomic disparity of Singapore. The film explores the aspirations of an average Singaporean to fit in and break free from the traditional divisions between people. This is shown through stories of various individuals, from transnational couples, to a transgender girl seeking acceptance, to a family trying to balance work and pleasure. It effectively captures the essence of the Singapore dream and the many responsibilities that must be shouldered in order to make it reality. The film contains interviews with Singaporeans from all walks of life. Each of them offers a unique perspective on the Singapore dream, whether it be the drive to achieve success, determination to overcome the odds, or the struggle to find acceptance in a rapidly changing society. The film paints an honest portrait of a nation that has gone through remarkable changes within a single generation. Despite the relatively recent rise in the standards of living and the expansion of opportunities, Singapore is still, as the film shows, a society with all its inherent complexities. This is true, however, not just of Singapore but of countries around the world. Singapore Dreaming is a challenging and inspirational story of individuals striving to come to terms with a society that is constantly in flux. It is a unique window into the struggles, aspirations and dreams of a nation.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 8294126}

He was a joint founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1783. He was a close friend of fellow founder David Hume.LifeHe was born in Old Newton House near Doune but the year is unclear. He was a younger brother of Sir Archibald Edmonstone, 1st Baronet of Duntreath and Newton. As a younger son he was not likely to inherit the baronetcy and followed a military career.It seems possible that he met David Hume at the University of Edinburgh and seems equally likely that he (as Hume) dropped out without graduating due to a lack of respect for the professors.At some point he joined the Perthshire Militia but may have transferred to the 3rd Dragoon Guards.He served at rank of captain in Brittany. He rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel and served variously in Geneva, Sienna, Paris and Dublin. Whilst having a military title a large proportion of this travel appears to have been in the role of 'travelling tutor' to the family of John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute (Lord Mountstuart). Due to the age of Earl Stuart's youngest child this role would have ceased by 1775 or before.In 1745 he (or his family) entertained Bonnie Prince Charlie for an evening at Old Newton House.In 1785 he lived at Adam's Court in Edinburgh. Here he was visited by David Hume who also visited his house at Doune.In 1793 he was admitted as a Member of the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland.

He was born in Ednaston, Scotland, the son of Alexander and Dorothy Edmonstone. In his youth, he became an apprentice at an indigo-making factory near Glasgow, and in 1837 he emigrated to Brazil, initially settling in Rio de Janeiro. He soon became a successful indigo producer in the eastern states, but by 1847 he had moved to the state of Bahia, where he was to become one of the largest slaveowners in Brazil. Edmonstone received his slave from Senhor Marques, a former senator from Minas Gerais, who had been convicted of illegal slave trading. James became one of the largest slave-owners in the region, owning over 500 slaves at one time. He purchased lands near Santo Amaro and began to cultivate sugar cane and produce indigo, which he then exported to Europe. Despite his slave-owning activities, Edmonstone was more progressive than his counterparts in the region and was heavily involved in the then-nascent abolition movement in Brazil. He spoke frequently on the subject of abolition, arguing that as a 'moral duty, we ought to take the part of slavery, wherever it exists.' He was also instrumental in helping to create the first abolitionist newspaper in Brazil, the 'Voce de Liberdade', in 1848. His campaigning and work did much to help the cause, and by 1871 the Brazilian slave trade had ended, with all slaves within Brazil finally freed in 1888. James Edmonstone became one of the most successful and respected businesspeople in the Brazilian state of Bahia. His business interests continued to expand during the 1850s and '60s, and he was responsible for building many of the key infrastructure projects in the region such as roads, bridges and railroads. He was active in local politics, becoming a member of the Bahian Chamber of Deputies in 1868, and he also published several books and essays on slavery, the economy, and Brazil's history and culture. Despite his gradual rise to prominence within the local community, Edmonstone's life was not without its controversies. In 1871 he was forced to flee to Portugal after scandals relating to his slave-trading activities threatened to land him in prison. He spent a number of years in Lisbon and then moved to the town of Salvador, where he lived until his death in 1894. During his life, he made a huge impact on the economic, social and political landscape of Brazil, and his legacy lives on today in the many monuments, streets and buildings named in his honour across the country. As a result, he is remembered by many Brazilian historians as one of the greatest figures of abolitionism in Brazil, and a daring and pioneering champion of justice and human rights.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 66671473}

The school quickly outgrew its location and moved three more times before its final move to a larger building on Fifth Avenue in 1932. Academy of Saint Joseph emphasized the importance of holistic learning and adopted a curriculum which combined rigorous academic courses with broader opportunities in the arts, spiritual development, and hands-on service learning. Classes were small, allowing each student to be given the opportunity to develop and grow in her own way. The school boasted several successful alumni, including Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, and the actress and singer Whoopi Goldberg. The school also had a service-oriented spirit, providing a variety of outreach opportunities for their students both on campus and around the world. In 2018, the school was forced to close its doors due to the financial strain of increasing tuitions and donations. Many former students and alumnae of the Academy were dismayed and saddened by the news.

A regular polygon exists in 2 real dimensions, , while a complex polygon exists in two complex dimensions, , which can be given real representations in 4 dimensions, , which then must be projected down to 2 or 3 real dimensions to be visualized. A complex polygon is generalized as a complex polytope in .A complex polygon may be understood as a collection of complex points, lines, planes, and so on, where every point is the junction of multiple lines, every line of multiple planes, and so on.The regular complex polygons have been completely characterized, and can be described using a symbolic notation developed by Coxeter.Regular complex polygons While 1-polytopes can have unlimited p, finite regular complex polygons, excluding the double prism polygons p42, are limited to 5-edge (pentagonal edges) elements, and infinite regular aperiogons also include 6-edge (hexagonal edges) elements.NotationsShephard's modified Schläfli notationShephard originally devised a modified form of Schläfli's notation for regular polytopes. For a polygon bounded by p1-edges, with a p2-set as vertex figure and overall symmetry group of order g, we denote the polygon as p1(g)p2.The number of vertices V is then g/p2 and the number of edges E is g/p1.The complex polygon illustrated above has eight square edges (p1=4) and sixteen vertices (p2=2). From this we can work out that g = 32, giving the modified Schläfli symbol 4(32)2.Coxeter's revised modified Schläfli notationA more modern notation p1qp2 is due to Coxeter, and is based on group theory. As a symmetry group, its symbol is p1[q]p2.The symmetry group p1[q]p2 is represented by 2 generators R1, R2, where: R1p1 = R2p2 = I. If q is even, (R2R1)q/2 = (R1R2)q/2. If q is odd, (R2R1)(q−1)/2R2 = (R1R2)(q−1)/2R1. When q is odd, p1=p2.For 4[4]2 has R14 = R22 = I, (R2R1)2 = (R1R2)2.For 3[5]3 has R13 = R23 = I, (R2R1)2R2 = (R1R2)2R1.Coxeter–Dynkin diagramsCoxeter also generalised the use of Coxeter–Dynkin diagrams to complex polytopes, for example the complex polygon pqr is represented byand the equivalent symmetry group, p[q]r, is a ringless diagram . The nodes p and r represent mirrors producing p and r images in the plane. Unlabeled nodes in a diagram have implicit 2 labels. For example, a real regular polygon is 2q2 or q or .One limitation, nodes connected by odd branch orders must have identical node orders. If they do not, the group will create 'starry' polygons, with overlapping element. Soandare ordinary, whileis starry.12 Irreducible Shephard groupsCoxeter enumerated this list of regular complex polygons in . A regular complex polygon, pqr or , has p-edges, and r-gonal vertex figures. pqr is a finite polytope if (p + r)q > pr(q − 2).Its symmetry is written as p[q]r, called a Shephard group, analogous to a Coxeter group, while also allowing unitary reflections.For nonstarry groups, the order of the group p[q]r can be computed as .The Coxeter number for p[q]r is, so the group order can also be computed as . A regular complex polygon can be drawn in orthogonal projection with h-gonal symmetry.The rank 2 solutions that generate complex polygons are:Excluded solutions with odd q and unequal p and r are: 6[3]2, 6[3]3, 9[3]3, 12[3]3, ..., 5[5]2, 6[5]2, 8[5]2, 9[5]2, 4[7]2, 9[5]2, 3[9]2, and 3[11]2.Other whole q with unequal p and r, create starry groups with overlapping fundamental domains: , , , , , and .The dual polygon of pqr is rqp. A polygon of the form pqp is self-dual. Groups of the form p[2q]2 have a half symmetry p[q]p, so a regular polygonis the same as quasiregular . As well, regular polygon with the same node orders, , have an alternated construction , allowing adjacent edges to be two different colors.The group order, g, is used to compute the total number of vertices and edges. It will have g/r vertices, and g/p edges. When p=r, the number of vertices and edges are equal.

It requires at least three distinct shapes and at least nine total sides. A regular complex polygon can not be transformed into another shape without changing its sides or the type of figures. A regular complex polygon has a pair of two convex figures, such as a triangle and a quadrilateral, that share an edge. The remaining sides of the polygon are made up of the remainder of the complex figures, typically irregular or unconnected shapes. These shapes can be, for example, parallel lines, intersections of lines, semicircles or arcs. The different shapes that make up the sides of the polygon may also be clumped together in a chain of multiple shapes, like a chain of two or more adjacent pentagons, for example. The internal angles of a regular complex polygon can be identified by their size relative to their adjacent angles. The smallest angles of these polygons, the 'dihedral angles,' must be the same size. For example, if the first angle is an obtuse angle, all of the angles must also be obtuse. There are three types of regular complex polygons: cyclic, equilateral, and equicontinuous. Cyclic complex polygons refer to shapes that can be circumscribed by a single circle; the sides of the polygon, including one side of each figure, must lie on the circumference of the circle. The angle between any two consecutive sides of the polygon must be an integral multiple of 360° divided by the number of sides. Equilateral complex polygons must have all of their sides of equal length, much like a regular polygon. The internal angles of an equilateral polygon are closely related to the number of sides. For a polygon with an odd number of sides, each of the internal angles is an integral multiple of 180° divided by the number of sides, while the internal angles of a polygon with an even number of sides form the sides of an underlying regular polygon. The third type of regular complex polygon, equicontinuous, refers to a polygon whose internal angles are all equal. In this type of polygon, the angles between any two consecutive sides are also equal. For example, if all of the angles between the sides of the polygon are 137°, then the angles between any two consecutive sides must also be 137°. These three types of regular complex polygons are helpful for math problems such as variations on the traditional area formulas, or Packman's theorem, which states that the area of a complex polygon is equal to the sum of the areas of its triangular components. Regular complex polygons can be found in many fields, such as architecture, physics, engineering and biology. They are also used as mathematical models for fractals and other irregular shapes. Additionally, they have been studied in relation to the four color theorem, which states that any map can be colored with at most four colors such that no two regions that share a common boundary are colored with the same color.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 50885422}

Printed on pink paper, it was published by Walter R. May for The Herald and Weekly Times at corner Flinders and Russell streets, Melbourne. Initially the Saturday edition was priced at 2d, and the larger Wednesday edition at 3d. With the introduction of the Wednesday edition it also widened its coverage beyond purely sport, acquiring the subtitle 'A Journal of Sport, the Stage and the Screen'. However, during 1924 it dropped the subtitle and returned to covering purely sport.The Saturday edition of the newspaper played an important part in Melbourne's football culture, particularly before the introduction of television to Australia in 1956: the newspaper was released one to two hours after the completion of the afternoon's Victorian Football League games, and contained results and match reports.Former writers at the newspaper noted that the expansion of television coverage of football reduced the Sporting Globes utility and readership, along with the preference for cars over public transport; ultimately the Saturday evening edition was discontinued in 1979, with the final Wednesday edition being published on 2 September 1996.ReferencesExternal linksDefunct newspapers published in Melbourne Publications established in 1922 Publications disestablished in 1996 Weekly newspapers published in Australia Newspapers on Trove Sports newspapers published in Australia", "machine_text": " The Sporting Globe was a British sports newspaper published in London during the 1880s and 1890s. Founded by the sports journalist J.T. Baines in 1886, The Sporting Globe focused on reporting on British sports and sporting events, combined with a wide variety of relevant news and commentary. The paper was published weekly in four different sections: Reports, Controversy, Personal Notes, and Invitations. The Reports section featured primary source reports on events and activities, while the Controversy section featured editorials and commentary. The Personal Notes were devoted to personal histories, while the Invitations section disseminated offers to compete in sporting competitions. The Sporting Globe was forward-thinking in its approach to sports journalism and as such was the first newspaper to feature full editorial pages devoted exclusively to sports news and commentary. As the paper gained popularity, Baines began to print a number of high-profile interviews with prominent sports personalities of the day, such as the renowned cricket player and later king's counselor W.G. Grace. By the late 1890s, The Sporting Globe had a readership of over 40,000 and had become one of Britain’s most popular publications. Its influence was strong enough that at one point, the paper was given a government contract to report on naval affairs from the Netherlands and Belgium. Despite its success, The Sporting Globe was eventually discontinued in 1899 due to competition from other sports newspapers that had entered the market. Today, the paper is remembered as one of the earliest examples of sports journalism in Britain, paving the way for the numerous sports-oriented newspapers that now dominate the British market. The paper’s legacy is further preserved through the annual Sporting Globe Award given to a journalist in Britain for excellence in sports journalism and reporting.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 46964080}

It is the sum of the three preceding numbers in the Fibonacci sequence, and the last number before the sequence starts over again. It is also the sum of the first eleven numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. 560 is also a triangular number, meaning that it can be expressed as the sum of consecutive natural numbers starting from one. For example, 560 can be expressed as 1 + 2 + 3 + … + 28 + 29. In Pythagorean numerology, 560 is known as the number of “Dignity”. It is associated with higher learning, recognition and respect because of its holy number status. In relation to polyhedrons, 560 is the number of faces of the great stellated dodecahedron, the fourth of the Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra. This polyhedron has twelve regular pentagonal faces and twenty regular star pentagram faces.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Paul Nietsche\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Paul Nietsche (17 June 1885 – 4 October 1950) was a Ukrainian artist and teacher who emigrated to Ulster in 1936.Early lifePaul Felix Franz Nietsche was born to German parents in Kiev in the Ukraine on 17June 1885. At the age of six his family moved to Odessa where his father established a lithographic printing firm. His artistic talents were encouraged by his Mother from a young age. Nietsche's Mother was said to have pawned his brother's coat on one occasion to buy paints for him.Nietsche studied art at the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts in Odessa under Gennadiy Ladyzhensky and Kiriak Kostandi. In 1908 he enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts in Berlin. Nietsche then moved to Paris where he befriended the sculptor Auguste Rodin and showed at the Salon of 1912. Nietsche returned to Odessa in 1914 where he remained until the end of World War I, when he relocated to Berlin to be with his family.Life and worksWhilst living in Berlin Nietsche befriended a post-graduate student and later a lecturer in English at the University of Leipzig, the Dubliner Michael O'Brien. When O'Brien moved to Queens University Belfast as a lecturer in Celtic Studies in 1926, Nietsche was invited to visit Belfast where he was to show five paintings with the Ulster Art Club in the same year. Between 1926 and 1934 Nietsche travelled extensively throughout Europe supported through exhibitions and picture sales. He painted outside Dubrovnik in 1928; Avignon, Castlewellan, and Switzerland in 1931; Cornwall and Berlin in 1933; and revisited both Cornwall and the South of France in the following year. Throughout this period he returned several times to Ulster, to the O'Brien's in Belfast and to fellow artist Herbert E Broderick's home in Castlewellan. In Cornwall he stayed with the painter R S Rendle Wood.In 1929 Nietsche held an exhibition of paintings at Michael O'Brien's home at 411 Lisburn Road, Belfast. He exhibited just once at the Royal Hibernian Academy, in 1930. In the year that he settled in Northern Ireland Nietsche exhibited at the Brook Street Art Galleries in London in 1934, with a further one man show at Dublin's United Arts Club in June of that year. The London exhibition comprised 28 paintings with the majority being Cornish subjects. Two years later he held a show at the Magee Gallery in Belfast.In 1936 Nietsche travelled extensively throughout the US and Canada, and afterwards returned to work in Devon and Cornwall before his onward journey to Belfast. At the invitation of Major R G Heyn, Nietsche's work debuted in Canada in 1936, with an exhibition at the Continental Galleries of Fine Art in Montreal. The show comprised 28 works including landscapes, still-life, flowers and a few self-portraits. Several of the landscapes were local scenes of Georgeville and Lake Memphremagog. Nietsche showed with John Hunter and George MacCann at Belfast's Magee Gallery in 1938, with a further solo display at the same venue in 1939. Nietsche applied to be a British citizen in 1938 from an address at 9 Finaghy Park Central in south Belfast.During World War II Nietsche was interned on the Isle of Man 'with chess-playing intellectuals', before re-establishing himself on the Belfast art scene by opening an attic studio at 76 Dublin Road in the city where he was to work until the end of his life. In 1943 Nietsche showed alongside Stanley Prosser, Seamus Stoupe, and Newton Penprase in the annual Ulster Arts Club exhibition at the Belfast Municipal Gallery.Art collector and patron Zoltan Lewinter-Frankl opened an exhibition of Nietsche's flower paintings at Tyrone House on Belfast's Ormeau Avenue in 1945. The exhibition was arranged under the auspices of the Council For the Encouragement of Music and Art with thirty works loaned from local patrons. In 1946 the Council for the Encouragement of Music and Art purchased a painting by Nietsche, in addition to works by other contemporary Ulster artists. Twenty-four of the works from the CEMA collection, including Nietsche's painting, were later presented at their Donegall Place gallery in 1954.Nietsche showed at the CEMA Gallery in Belfast in 1947, 1948, and in 1949. The latter comprised 21 paintings and was opened by his good friend, the Lisburn writer Barbara Hunter, whom along with H E Broderick, had contributed a foreword to the 1947 exhibition. The 1949 exhibition included portraits of the stage actors Robert H McCandless, and James G Devlin and the catalogue contained a foreword by the Odd Man Out writer, FL Green. The reviewer for the Lisburn Standard commented,'Though small in some ways, it is the finest show Nietsche has had in Belfast, for as the years go by he seems to acquire even greater genius in his art, so that he seems at times to almost improve upon nature, adding his own vitality and sensibility to his lovely studies of flowers and fruit.'The artist also wrote poetry and short stories. He was fluent in Russian, French, German and English. Nietsche parodied local attitudes to modern art in a 1948 play and in 1949 he contributed one poem, A Vision, to the shortlived Ulster poetry journal Rann established by his old friend Barbara Hunter and Roy McFadden in the previous year. His students included Markey Robinson and Jean Osborne.The actor Jack Loudan described Nietsche's charitable nature in 1972, in repairing broken dolls, cars and trucks, which he would later distribute to underprivileged children around Castlewellan, County Down. Nietsche's eccentric nature was often cited, and indeed Loudan refers to the alarm experienced by visitors to Nietsche's Dublin Road studio where he fed and entertained with a mouse that had taken up residence there. Nietsche's portrait of Loudan can be viewed in the collection of the National Museums of Northern Ireland. Nietsche's eccentricities extended to his studio where the poet Roy McFadden says he 'flaunted a huge ceramic penis on the wall'. His home and studio were open house to visitors from members of Belfasts artistic and theatrical world, whom Nietsche would entertain with coffee and conversation whilst he continued working. He rose late in the day and worked long into the night, often retiring just before sunrise. He spent some time in Belfast City Hospital in June 1948 and later convalesced at the Crawfordsburn Inn as a guest of a friend. He never fully recovered from this illness and suffered from ill-health until his death.Artistic styleDr S B Kennedy described Nietsche's style in 1991, 'His style was based on careful observation of the world around him. Nietsche was a fine colourist. He was at his best when painting still lifes [...] flowers and portraits [...] His landscapes by comparison are less successful, the compositions often lacking resolution while the colours are occasionally muddied and less boldly stated than in his other works. Perhaps the intimacy of a portrait or the exuberance of a group of flowers suited his temperament more than the panorama of landscape.'Dr Sarah Finlay, writing of his work in the National Self-Portrait Collection of Ireland, described his working methods,'He worked slowly, taking up to fifteen or more sittings of one or two hours to complete each portrait. Landscapes, still lifes and flower studies make up the rest of his subject-matter. His landscapes tend to be dark, his still lifes and flower paintings more colourful. His style is loose and his line assured. The emphasis on form, in the still lifes in particular indicates the influence of Cézanne, whose work he saw and admired when living in Paris between 1912 and 1914.'Death and legacyPaul Nietsche died in Belfast City Hospital on 4 October 1950, after falling ill at his studio four days earlier whilst preparing work for exhibition in London and Dublin. He was unmarried and had no children. Nietsche was survived by three brothers.A short funeral service was held at All Souls Church on Elmwood Avenue, before his remains were interred at Belfast City Cemetery. Amongst the mourners were Zoltan and Anny Frankl, Jack Loudan of CEMA, Professor J L Montrose of Queen's University, and Joseph Tomelty and R H McCandless of the Group Theatre. Amongst the artists present were William Conor, William R Gordon, Fred Hull, Herbert E Broderick, John Lyness and William Minshull.His friends organised a memorial exhibition of his works in the Ulster Farmers' Union Hall in Belfast in 1952 for which Nietsche's brother Eugene made his first visit to Belfast. Jack Loudan opened the exhibition and expressed his desire to see Nietsche commanding his own section in the Belfast Museum and Art Gallery. The Arts Council of Northern Ireland held a retrospective at the Arts Council Gallery in Belfast in 1984.His works can be seen in many public and private collections including the Ulster Museum, the Arts Council of Northern Ireland and the National Self-Portrait Collection of Ireland.ReferencesExternal linksWorks of Paul Nietsche in private collections via Rosss.comPaul Nietsche's work in the collection of the Ulster Museum via Artuk.org1885 births 1950 deaths 20th-century male artists from Northern Ireland Painters from Northern Ireland Irish male artists Irish male painters 20th-century Irish painters 20th-century Ukrainian painters Imperial Academy of Arts alumni Ukrainian male painters 20th-century Ukrainian male artists", "machine_text": " Paul Nietsche (1844 - 1900) was a German philosopher, cultural critic, poet, playwright and composer. He is most famous for his ideas on the philosophy of nihilism, will to power, eternal recurrence, and the the Übermensch. His theories were influential in the development of existentialism, modern science and psychology. Nietsche was born in Prussia, in 1844. He was raised Catholic, but later renounced his faith, citing his desire for intellectual freedom and independence. He went on to attend various universities in Germany, becoming a professor of classical philology. His initial works examined the works of Greek literature, but eventually shifted to philosophical considerations ending with his masterpiece, Thus Spoke Zarathustra. Despite his earlier works on classical philology, from 1883 onwards Nietsche used a more philosophical approach to describe the struggles of the individual against dominant cultural norms of obedience and conformity. His later works, such as Beyond Good and Evil and The Genealogy of Morals, argued that the concept of morality was only a construct used by the strong to oppress the weak. Nietsche's work explored nihilism and the creation of meaning in a seemingly meaningless universe, and is considered to be one of the founding fathers of existentialism. Nietsche's ideas are generally divided into two categories: metaphysical nihilism, in which he rejected the idea of a 'higher power' or 'ultimate truth'; and ontological nihilism, in which he explored the idea of nothingness, or 'the absence of being'. He is also known for his theories on the Will to Power, a concept which has been adopted as a cornerstone in many different fields of study, such as sociology and philosophy. Nietsche's fame reached its peak in the twentieth century, when his works were adopted by various groups in order to advance their own agendas, often with great controversy. In Nazi Germany, for instance, his works were used to legitimise the Nazi worldview. This greatly damaged Nietsche's reputation, and even today his ideas are misunderstood and often misrepresented. Nietsche's work has without doubt brought a lot of backlash and confusion, but it has also played a key role in the development of modern philosophic thought and culture. He may have had his critics, but Nietsche's ideas remain as relevant and provocative today as when they first appeared over a century ago.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 67227993}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Crips\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Crips is an alliance of street gangs which is based in the coastal regions of southern California. It was founded in Los Angeles, California, in 1969, mainly by Raymond Washington and Stanley Williams. Once a single alliance between two autonomous gangs, it is now a loosely-connected network of individual 'sets', often engaged in open warfare with one another. Traditionally, since around 1973, its members have worn blue clothing.The Crips are one of the largest and most violent associations of street gangs in the United States. With an estimated 30,000 to 35,000 members in 2008, the members have been involved in murders, robberies and drug dealing, among other crimes. They have a long and bitter rivalry with the Bloods.EtymologySome sources suggest that the original name for the alliance, 'Cribs', was narrowed down from a list of many options and chosen unanimously from three final choices, over the Black Overlords and the Assassins. Cribs was chosen to reflect the young age of the majority of the gang members. The name evolved into 'Crips' when gang members began carrying around canes to display their 'pimp' status. People in the neighborhood then began calling them cripples, or 'Crips' for short. In February 1972 the Los Angeles Times used the term. Another source suggests 'Crips' may have evolved from 'Cripplers', a 1970s street gang in Watts, of which Washington was a member. The name had no political, organizational, cryptic, or acronymic meaning, though some have suggested it stands for 'Common Revolution In Progress', a backronym. According to the film Bastards of the Party, directed by a member of the Bloods, the name represented 'Community Revolutionary Interparty Service' or 'Community Reform Interparty Service'.HistoryGang activity in South Central Los Angeles has its roots in a variety of factors dating to the 1950s, including: post-World War II economic decline leading to joblessness and poverty; racial segregation of young African American men, who were excluded from organizations such as the Boy Scouts, leading to the formation of black 'street clubs'; and the waning of black nationalist organizations such as the Black Panther Party and the Black Power Movement.Stanley Tookie Williams met Raymond Lee Washington in 1969, and the two decided to unite their local gang members from the west and east sides of South Central Los Angeles in order to battle neighboring street gangs. Most of the members were 17 years old. Williams however appears to discount the sometimes-cited founding date of 1969 in his memoir, Blue Rage, Black Redemption.In his memoir, Williams also refuted claims that the group was a spin-off of the Black Panther Party or formed for a community agenda, writing that it 'depicted a fighting alliance against street gangs—nothing more, nothing less.' Washington, who attended Fremont High School, was the leader of the East Side Crips, and Williams, who attended Washington High School, led the West Side Crips.Williams recalled that a blue bandana was first worn by Crips founding member Buddha, as a part of his color-coordinated clothing of blue Levis, a blue shirt, and dark blue suspenders. A blue bandana was worn in tribute to Buddha after he was shot and killed on February 23, 1973. The color then became associated with Crips.By 1978, there were 45 Crip gangs, called sets, in Los Angeles. They were heavily involved in the production of PCP, marijuana and amphetamines. On March 11, 1979, Williams, a member of the Westside Crips, was arrested for four murders and on August 9, 1979, Washington was gunned down. Washington had been against Crip infighting and after his death several Crip sets started fighting against each other. The Crips' leadership was dismantled, prompting a deadly gang war between the Rollin' 60 Neighborhood Crips and Eight Tray Gangster Crips that led nearby Crip sets to choose sides and align themselves with either the Neighborhood Crips or the Gangster Crips, waging large-scale war in South Central and other cities. The East Coast Crips (from East Los Angeles) and the Hoover Crips directly severed their alliance after Washington's death. By 1980, the Crips were in turmoil, warring with the Bloods and against each other. The gang's growth and influence increased significantly in the early 1980s when crack cocaine hit the streets and Crip sets began distributing the drug. Large profits induced many Crips to establish new markets in other cities and states. As a result, Crips membership grew steadily and the street gang was one of the nation's largest by the late 1980s. In 1999, there were at least 600 Crip sets with more than 30,000 members transporting drugs in the United States.Membership As of 2015, the Crips gang consists of between approximately 30,000 and 35,000 members and 800 sets, active in 221 cities and 41 U.S. states. The states with the highest estimated number of Crip sets are California, Texas, Oklahoma, and Missouri. Members typically consist of young African American men, but can be white, Hispanic, Asian, and Pacific Islander. Crip sets are not exclusive to the United States, having a presence in the Canadian cities of Montreal and Toronto.In 1992 the LAPD estimated 15,742 Crips in 108 sets; other source estimates were 30,000 to 35,000 in 600 sets in California.Crips have served in the United States armed forces and on military bases in the United States and abroad.PracticesLanguage Some practices of Crip gang life include graffiti and substitutions and deletions of particular letters of the alphabet. The letter 'b' in the word 'blood' is 'disrespected' among certain Crip sets and written with a cross inside it because of its association with the enemy. The letters 'CK', which are interpreted to stand for 'Crip killer', are avoided and replaced by 'cc'. For example, the words 'kick back' are written 'kicc bacc', and block is written as 'blocc'. Many other words and letters are also altered due to symbolic associations. Crips traditionally refer to each other as 'Cuz' or 'Cuzz', which itself is sometimes used as a moniker for a Crip. 'Crab' is the most disrespectful epithet to call a Crip, and can warrant fatal retaliation. Crips in prison modules in the 1970s and 1980s sometimes spoke Swahili to maintain privacy from guards and rival gangs.Initiation ('Jumping in')Although getting 'jumped into the gang' is often commonly thought of as a typical initiation ritual performed on newcomers, some former Crip members such as rapper Brotha Lynch Hung, who joined the 24 Street Crips in Sacramento, California during the 1980s has pointed out that the tradition of getting jumped (beaten) into the gang was 'more of a 1970s (era) practice' rather than a modern or continuing one.Criminal rackets and street-activitiesAs with most criminal street gangs they have traditionally benefited monetarily from a select set of illicit activities such as illegal gambling, drug-dealing, prostitution, burglary, theft and extortion. Along with profitable rackets such as these, they have also been known to participate in vandalism and property crime, often for gang-pride reasons or just enjoyment. This can include public graffiti (tagging) and 'joyriding' in stolen vehicles.Their current primary illicit source of income is presumably in street-level drug distribution, however many Crip members may also make notable amounts of illegal funds from the black market sale of illicit firearms. Historically, the gang’s size and power was largely augmented by the profits from the street sale of crack cocaine throughout the 1980s showing that PCP, amphetamines and other drugs were not as lucrative for them and thus didn’t have as direct of an effect on the group’s increase in influence.Therefore the gang’s initial phase of growth and popularity can, in some way, be directly traced back to the explosion crack cocaine in the United States during the 1980s.Crip-on-Crip rivalriesThe Crips became popular throughout southern Los Angeles as more youth gangs joined; at one point they outnumbered non-Crip gangs by 3 to 1, sparking disputes with non-Crip gangs, including the L.A. Brims, Athens Park Boys, the Bishops, The Drill Company, and the Denver Lanes. By 1971 the gang's notoriety had spread across Los Angeles.By 1971, a gang on Piru Street in Compton, California, known as the Piru Street Boys, formed and associated itself with the Crips as a set. After two years of peace, a feud began between the Pirus and the other Crip sets. It later turned violent as gang warfare ensued between former allies. This battle continued and by 1973, the Pirus wanted to end the violence and called a meeting with other gangs targeted by the Crips. After a long discussion, the Pirus broke all connections to the Crips and started an organization that would later be called the Bloods, a street gang infamous for its rivalry with the Crips.Since then, other conflicts and feuds were started between many of the remaining Crip sets. It is a common misconception that Crip sets feud only with Bloods. In reality, they also fight each other—for example, the Rolling 60s Neighborhood Crips and 83 Gangster Crips have been rivals since 1979. In Watts, the Grape Street Crips and the PJ Watts Crips have feuded so much that the PJ Watts Crips even teamed up with a local Blood set, the Bounty Hunter Bloods, to fight the Grape Street Crips. In the mid-1990s, the Hoover Crips rivalries and wars with other Crip sets caused them to become independent and drop the Crip name, calling themselves the Hoover Criminals.Alliances and rivalriesRivalry with BloodsThe Bloods are the Crips' main stereotypical rival. The Bloods initially formed to provide members protection from the Crips. The rivalry started in the 1960s when Washington and other Crip members attacked Sylvester Scott and Benson Owens, two students at Centennial High School. After the incident, Scott formed the Pirus, while Owens established the West Piru gang. In late 1972, several gangs that felt victimized by the Crips due to their escalating attacks joined the Pirus to create a new federation of non-Crip gangs that later became known as Bloods. Between 1972 and 1979, the rivalry between the Crips and Bloods grew, accounting for a majority of the gang-related murders in southern Los Angeles. Members of the Bloods and Crips occasionally fight each other and, as of 2010, are responsible for a significant portion of gang-related murders in Los Angeles.Alliance with Folk NationIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, as many Crip gang members were being sent to various prisons across the country, an alliance was formed between the Crips and the Folk Nation in Midwest and Southern U.S. prisons. This alliance was established to protect gang members incarcerated in state and federal prison. It is strongest within the prisons, and less effective outside. The alliance between the Crips and Folks is known as '8-ball'. A broken 8-ball indicates a disagreement or 'beef' between Folks and Crips.See alsoAfrican-American organized crime Crip Walk Crime in Los Angeles Gangs in Los Angeles Crips and Bloods: Made in AmericaReferencesFootnotesGeneralLeon Bing (1991).

They are one of the largest and most notorious gangs in the United States and are known for their involvement in drug distribution, drive-by shootings, and street-level violence. The gang’s signature colors are blue and gray, and its members are known to carry signs with 'CK' or the full gang name written on them. The Crips’ main rivals are the Bloods, another Los Angeles-based gang. The gang was initially established in 1969, taking its name from ‘Cribs’, a term used for African-American youth that came from the south in search of work. According to some reports, the founders of the Crips were high school students that wanted to create an organized group to protect themselves from other gangs. In the beginning, the Crips’ activities consisted of petty neighborhood crime such as vandalism and extortion. As the group grew larger, they began to make increasing profits from drug sales, drive-by shootings, robberies, and other criminal activities. By the 1980s, the Crips had established themselves as one of the most powerful gangs in America. Members of the gang have been implicated in numerous murders, shootings, and other violent acts throughout the United States. Crips-related violence has been reported in over 35 states, including California, Florida, Texas, and New York. The Crips’ trademark sign is ‘CK’ or the gang’s full name written on clothing and jewelry. Members of the gang are also known for wearing blue and gray bandanas and blue and gray belts with a large ‘C’ on them. The gang has a habit of tagging graffiti to mark their territory; this has become a visual clue for law enforcement officers, who use it to identify a gang's location. In recent years, the Crips have been losing ground in its fight against rival gang, the Bloods. Law enforcement and community groups have made concerted efforts to combat gang violence, and have worked together to help members of the Crips turn away from a life of crime. These efforts have yielded positive results; the gang has now become less active and less visible in certain areas. In addition, some members of the Crips have begun to engage in dialogues with law enforcement officers, despite the hostile relationship between the two sides. Despite the decreased activity of the Crips, Los Angeles remains one of the most gang-ridden cities in the nation. The Crips have had a long-lasting and lasting effect in Los Angeles and other cities, with both positive and negative influences. Although the original founders of the gang had good intentions, the violence and destruction associated with the Crips and their activities is undeniable.

Cienfuegos did not play in the 1927–28 season, contending again from 1928–29 through 1930–31. After eight long years of absence, Cienfuegos reappeared in the 1939–40 tournament. In the 1949–50 season, the team was renamed as the Elefantes de Cienfuegos (Cienfuegos Elephants). 'The pace of the elephant is slow but crushing', exclaimed the slogan of the Cienfuegos franchise that contended until the 1960–61 season. Following the 1959 Cuban Revolution, political tensions rose with the Fidel Castro government. In March 1961, one month after the regular season ended, the new Cuban regime decreed the abolition of professional baseball in Cuba.In 26 Championships in which Cienfuegos participated, the team won five league titles in 1929–30, 1945–46, 1955–56, 1959–60 and 1960–61, finishing second 6 times, third 7 times, and fourth 8 times, posting a 732–793 record for a .480 average.

According to Osvaldo Hernández’s Baseball in Cuba, Cienfuegos were the winners of the 1919 championship, and the team is considered to be one of the oldest and most successful teams in Cuban professional baseball. Cienfuegos were the most successful team in Cuban League history during the period 1934-1952, winning six national championships and three Caribbean Series titles. After the second Cuban team, Industriales, began playing in 1953, Cienfuegos and Industriales began what is widely recognized as the greatest rivalry in Cuban baseball history. Since then the two teams have gone head-to-head over 105 times, with Cienfuegos statistically holding the lead in wins. Aside from their success in the Cuban League, Cienfuegos has been a prominent presence in international competition. The team represented Cuba in the 1981 Intercontinental Cup, taking home a Bronze Medal finish, and sent two members to the 1985 Intercontinental Cup in Italy, as members of the Cuban National Team. Cienfuegos underwent significant changes in the 1990s, starting with the 1996-97 baseball season, when the club left the city of Cienfuegos and moved to Havana, becoming a de facto team of the Industriales. This move was simply the result of the collapse of the Cuban economy, which resulted in a lack of finances for the existing teams in the Cuban League. Today Cienfuegos is a part of the Cuban National Series baseball league, playing as a home team located in the Marianao neighborhood of Havana. The team is still referred to as the 'Elefantes de Cienfuegos' (Elephants of Cienfuegos), and they are still amongst the most successful teams in the Cuban League. The team has won two Cuban League championships (1998-99 and 2006-07) and two Caribbean World Series titles (2009 and 2011). Cienfuegos remains one of the most historic teams in Cuban baseball. Despite several decades of up and down periods, the 'Elefantes' have always been one of the most successful teams in professional Cuban baseball. Over the years, the club has produced many great players, such as Antonio Muñoz, René Arocha and Orlando Hernández. Thus, Cienfuegos will be remembered as one of the most important teams in Cuban baseball history.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 8689877}

The bright yellow globular flowerheads appear singly or in groups of two in the axils of the phyllodes from September to November, followed by curved seed pods which are 5 to 9 cm long and 2 to 4 mm wide.Taxonomy The species was formally described in 1967 by botanist Jim Willisbased on plant material collected from Pine Mountain in north-eastern Victoria. It was reclassified as Racosperma phasmoides by Leslie Pedley in 2003 and then transferred back to genus Acacia in 2006.Distribution Its distribution is limited to a small area on the border between south-eastern New South Wales and north-eastern Victoria. In New South Wales it is found along the southern edge of Woomargama National Park and has an estimated population of2000 plants. In Victoria it is found in the Burrowa-Pine Mountain National Park from two stands east of the summit of Pine Mountain with nine plants in one stand and between 150 and 250 in the other.

It grows in coastal and inland sand and sandstone areas of New South Wales, south-eastern Queensland, Victoria, and South Australia. The species was first formally described in 1992 by David Adelaide Rose, the curator of the Adelaide Botanic Gardens in South Australia, who described it as a form of Acacia filicina (since reclassified as Acacia stenophylla), and thus it is sometimes referred to as Acacia filicina subsp. phasmoides. The species grows as a wide-spreading shrub or tree, reaching a height of up to 4 metres, but most are considerably smaller. It has an open, spreading habit and often forms dense thickets. It is usually evergreen but may be semi-deciduous in times of drought. It has long, straplike leaves with raised midribs, and yellow, sweetly scented flowers appear in spring and summer. The flat-brown seedpods are about 10 cm long and contain up to 12 seeds apiece. The species tolerates a variety of soils, from sandy or stony areas to clay loam or black soils. It is drought tolerant and frost hardy in its native range. However, it can be affected by the gall maker Cladothrips haywardi, which causes the stems of the plant to form pea-sized galls. It is found in coastal areas, mainly around estuarine salt-marsh and wetland areas, where it helps to stabilize the shoreline and reduce erosion. It is often used in revegetation projects in these areas. It has become an important part of the diet of many species of birds, and attracts bees, butterflies and other creatures to its flowers. It can be propagated from seed or cuttings, though the latter method is not recommended. It is a hardy and useful landscape plant, useful in a range of situations from beach front to low walls along walkways. It is a great addition to native gardens and provides dramatic colour and texture in informal settings. Acacia phasmoides has a conservation status of 'secure' in its native range and is regarded as a weed in some parts of South Australia. Control measures, such as chemical application, mowing and burning, have been used to reduce its spread, though there has been limited success in controlling its spread.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 37935230}

He composed the jazz and pop standards 'Snowfall' and 'I Wish I Had You'.Early years Thornhill was the son of J. Chester Thornhill and his wife, Maude. When he was 11 years old, he played piano professionally. While still a youth, he played with two local combos. As a student at Garfield High School in Terre Haute, he played with several theater bands. Thornhill entered the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music at the age of 16. He also studied at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia.Career As a youth, he was recognized as an extraordinary talent and formed a traveling duo with Danny Polo, a musical prodigy on the clarinet and trumpet from nearby Clinton, Indiana.He and clarinetist Artie Shaw started their careers at the Golden Pheasant in Cleveland, Ohio, with the Austin Wylie Orchestra. Thornhill and Shaw went to New York together in 1931. Thornhill went to the West Coast in the late 1930s with the Bob Hope Radio Show and arranged for Judy Garland in Babes in Arms. In 1935, he played on sessions with Glenn Miller, including 'Solo Hop', which was released on Columbia Records. He also played with Paul Whiteman, Benny Goodman, Ray Noble, and Billie Holiday. He arranged 'Loch Lomond' and 'Annie Laurie' for Maxine Sullivan.During the mid-1930s, Thornhill arranged and played piano for Andre Kostelanetz.In 1939, he founded the Claude Thornhill Orchestra. Polo was his lead clarinet player. Although the Thornhill band was a sophisticated dance band, it became known for its superior jazz musicians and for Thornhill's and Gil Evans's arrangements. The band played without vibrato, so that the timbres of the instruments could be better appreciated. Thornhill encouraged the musicians to develop cool-sounding tones. The band was popular with both musicians and the public. Miles Davis's Birth of the Cool nonet was modeled in part on Thornhill's sound and unconventional instrumentation. The band's most successful records were 'Snowfall', 'A Sunday Kind of Love', and 'Love for Love'.Thornhill was playing at the Paramount Theater in New York for 10,000 a week when he enlisted in the U.S. Navy as an apprentice seaman on October 26, 1942. As chief musician, he performed shows across the Pacific Theater with Jackie Cooper as his drummer and Dennis Day as his vocalist.In 1946, he was discharged from the Navy and reunited his ensemble. Polo, Gerry Mulligan, and Barry Galbraith returned with new members, Red Rodney, Lee Konitz, Joe Shulman, and Bill Barber. Thornhill and his orchestra played for the Judy, Jill and Johnny variety program on radio on the Mutual Broadcasting System in 1946–1947.In 1957, Thornhill became Tony Bennett's musical director. He offered his big band library to Gerry Mulligan when Mulligan formed the Concert Jazz Band, but Mulligan declined the gift, since his instrumentation was different. A large portion of his extensive library of music is currently held by Drury University in Springfield, Missouri.Thornhill died of a heart attack in Caldwell, New Jersey, at the age of 56. In 1984, he was posthumously inducted into the Big Band and Jazz Hall of Fame.CompositionsThornhill's compositions included the standard 'Snowfall', 'I Wish I Had You', recorded by Billie Holiday and Fats Waller, 'Let's Go', 'Shore Road', 'Portrait of a Guinea Farm', 'Lodge Podge', 'Rustle of Spring', 'It's Time for Us to Part', 'It Was a Lover and His Lass', 'The Little Red Man', 'Memory of an Island', and 'Where Has My Little Dog Gone?'Cover versions of 'Snowfall' Thornhill's 1941 piano composition 'Snowfall', later had lyrics written by his wife, Ruth Thornhill.

Thornhill was born in Terre Haute, Indiana. His father was a professional violinist who had led his own dance band since 1931, allowing the young Claude to absorb music from a very early age. Thornhill attended Indiana State University for two years, where he received classical training in composition and a degree in music theory. In his early career, Thornhill performed jazz music at several small clubs in the Midwest before receiving a job touring as a pianist for a vaudeville show. He later served as an arranger and accompanist for a number of famous bands, such as the Casa Loma Orchestra and the Ted Weems Orchestra. It was while working with Weems that Thornhill wrote his first hit song, “Harlem Nocturne”, which later became a jazz standard. In 1940, Thornhill formed his own orchestra and quickly earned a reputation as a progressive bandleader. He was among the first to arrange jazz music for a larger orchestra — including French horns and a full string section to complement the standard brass, woodwind, and rhythm sections — and he was always willing to experiment with fresh new sounds. Thornhill signed with Columbia Records in 1941 and released a number of critically acclaimed albums throughout the 1940s. His first big hit was the song “Snowfall”, which charted at #1 on Billboard’s chart of the nation’s most popular songs for two weeks in 1943. Thornhill's unique sound caught the attention of many jazz fans, and he became one of the first big swing bandleaders to draw a sizable crowd of African-American listeners. His colleague, trumpeter Miles Davis, noted that Thornhill was “the first genuine jazz composer and musician who had the nerve to write for a black audience'. In the 1950s and 1960s, Thornhill toured and recorded extensively until health problems forced him to retire in 1965, the year of his death. His influence continued to be felt long after, inspiring later generations of jazz musicians and composers.

Willow River was chosen as a changing station for the coach horses.In 1861 the Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad was organized with the financial help of Jay Cooke. It was only in August 1879 that the completed line from St. Paul to Duluth was opened. The railroad helped settle and promote living in the northern part of Minnesota. The railroad also promoted the lumber industry. Many towns and villages, including Willow River, were organized once a lumber company set up shop.In March 1874, the Kettle River Township was organized and Willow River at this time consisted of a railroad depot, water tank, wood yard, and two section houses built for the railroad hands.Pine County records show that the three sections of land that would eventually make up the village of Willow River were homesteaded by Edward Clough, Albert Kinney, Peter Jarvis, Joseph Nebula, and Richard Abbott. In 1886, Abbott sold his section of land to the Fox-Wisdom Lumber Company. In 1888, Jarvis sold his section to Fox-Wisdom. In the spring of 1890, Warren D. Fox and John Wisdom opened the Fox-Wisdom Lumber Company in Willow River. The company then platted the land to build their business and offer lots for employees. By 1895, Kinney had leased his land to Fox-Wisdom, and Clough had sold all but 80 acres of his section in the northern part of the village. Joseph Nebula's section was past the lake and likely unusable to the company.The Fox-Wisdom Lumber Company sawmill was constructed and opened in March 1890. It was located on the south side of the present day Willow River dam. To ease the flow of logs, dams were built along the river to store water. There were as least three built and maintained by Fox-Wisdom. They were known as the 'Mile and a Half,' the 'Willow Lake,' and the 'Oak Lake' dams. Sawmill operations began in the early spring and continued until the freeze-up of the mill pond. The mill produced lumber, lath, and shingles employing about 125 men. The mill cut 125,000 feet of lumber per day during their peak season. Many who worked in the logging camps during the winter came to the mill to work in the spring.On May 8, 1891, the village plat was filed in Pine County. The Fox-Wisdom Lumber Company and its employees made up the majority of property owners. Willow River, like many other villages in northern Minnesota, owed its existence to the lumber industry. In November 1891, Willow River was incorporated as a village by a vote of 37 to 18 in the upstairs hall of the Fox-Wisdom Company store.Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of whichis land andis water.Demographics2010 census As of the census of 2010, there were 415 people, 173 households, and 103 families residing in the city.

The area of Willow River was first settled by European immigrants in the late 1800's. The most popular industry was logging as the area was densely wooded. In 1909, a post office was established, and the village grew as more people moved to the area. In 1897, an independent school district was created to provide schooling for the children of the area. Willow River is located at the intersection of U.S. Route 63 and state highway 35. The city is near several wildlife refuges in the area, such as Moosehorn National Wildlife Refuge and Sand Lake National Wildlife Refuge. There are also several marinas on the nearby Willow River.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Reserved word\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "In a computer language, a reserved word (also known as a reserved identifier) is a word that cannot be used as an identifier, such as the name of a variable, function, or label – it is 'reserved from use'. This is a syntactic definition, and a reserved word may have no user-define meaning.A closely related and often conflated notion is a keyword, which is a word with special meaning in a particular context. This is a semantic definition. By contrast, names in a standard library but not built into the language are not considered reserved words or keywords. The terms 'reserved word' and 'keyword' are often used interchangeably – one may say that a reserved word is 'reserved for use as a keyword' – and formal use varies from language to language; for this article we distinguish as above.In general reserved words and keywords need not coincide, but in most modern languages keywords are a subset of reserved words, as this makes parsing easier, since keywords cannot be confused with identifiers. In some languages, like C or Python, reserved words and keywords coincide, while in other languages, like Java, all keywords are reserved words, but some reserved words are not keywords – these are 'reserved for future use'. In yet other languages, such as the older languages ALGOL, FORTRAN and PL/I, there are keywords but no reserved words, with keywords being distinguished from identifiers by other means. This makes parsing more difficult with look-ahead parsers necessary.Distinction The sets of reserved words and keywords in a language often coincide or are almost equal, and the distinction is subtle, so the terms are often used interchangeably. However, in careful usage they are distinguished.Making keywords be reserved words makes lexing easier, as a string of characters will unambiguously be either a keyword or an identifier, without depending on context; thus keywords are usually a subset of reserved words. However, reserved words need not be keywords – for example, in Java, goto is a reserved word, but has no meaning and does not appear in any production rules in the grammar. This is usually done for forward compatibility, so a reserved word may become a keyword in a future version without breaking existing programs.Conversely, keywords need not be reserved words, with their role understood from context, or they may be distinguished in another manner, such as by stropping. For example, the phrase if = 1 is unambiguous in most grammars, since a control statement of an if clause cannot start with an =, and thus is allowed in some languages, such as FORTRAN. Alternatively, in ALGOL 68, keywords must be stropped – marked in some way to distinguished – in the strict language by listing in bold, and thus are not reserved words. Thus in the strict language the following expression is legal, as the bold keyword if does not conflict with the ordinary identifier if: if if eq 0 then 1 fi However, in ALGOL 68 there is also a stropping regime in which keywords are reserved words, an example of how these distinct concepts often coincide; this is followed in many modern languages.SyntaxA reserved word is one that 'looks like' a normal word, but is not allowed to be used as a normal word. Formally this means that it satisfies the usual lexical syntax (syntax of words) of identifiers – for example, being a sequence of letters – but cannot be used where identifiers are used. For example, the word if is commonly a reserved word, while x generally is not, so x = 1 is a valid assignment, but if = 1 is not.Keywords have varied uses, but primarily fall into a few classes: part of the phrase grammar (specifically a production rule with nonterminal symbols), with various meanings, often being used for control flow, such as the word if in most procedural languages, which indicates a conditional and takes clauses (the nonterminal symbols); names of primitive types in a language that support a type system, such as int; primitive literal values such as true for Boolean true; or sometimes special commands like exit. Other uses of keywords in phrases are for input/output, such as print.The distinct definitions are clear when a language is analyzed by a combination of a lexer and a parser, and the syntax of the language is generated by a lexical grammar for the words, and a context-free grammar of production rules for the phrases. This is common in analyzing modern languages, and in this case keywords are a subset of reserved words, as they must be distinguished from identifiers at the word level (hence reserved words) to be syntactically analyzed differently at the phrase level (as keywords).In this case reserved words are defined as part of the lexical grammar, and are each tokenized as a separate type, distinct from identifiers. In conventional notation, the reserved words if and then for example are tokenized as types IF and THEN, respectively, while x and y are both tokenized as type Identifier.Keywords, by contrast, syntactically appear in the phrase grammar, as terminal symbols. For example, the production rule for a conditional expression may be IF Expression THEN Expression. In this case IF and THEN are terminal symbols, meaning 'a token of type IF or THEN, respectively' – and due to the lexical grammar, this means the string if or then in the original source. As an example of a primitive constant value, true may be a keyword representing the boolean value 'true', in which case it should appear in the grammar as a possible expansion of the production BinaryExpression, for instance.Reserved ranges Beyond reserving specific lists of words, some languages reserve entire ranges of words, for use as private spaces for future language version, different dialects, compiler vendor-specific extensions, or for internal use by a compiler, notably in name mangling.This is most often done by using a prefix, often one or more underscores. C and C++ are notable in this respect: C99 reserves identifiers that start with two underscores or an underscore followed by an uppercase letter, and further reserves identifiers that start with a single underscore (in the ordinary and tag spaces) for use in file scope; with C++03 further reserves identifiers that contain a double underscore anywhere – this allows the use of a double underscore as a separator (to connect user identifiers), for instance.The frequent use of a double underscores in internal identifiers in Python gave rise to the abbreviation dunder; this was coined by Mark Jackson and independently by Tim Hochberg, within minutes of each other, both in reply to the same question in 2002.Specification The list of reserved words and keywords in a language are defined when a language is developed, and both form part of a language's formal specification. Generally one wishes to minimize the number of reserved words, to avoid restricting valid identifier names. Further, introducing new reserved words breaks existing programs that use that word (it is not backwards compatible), so this is avoided. To prevent this and provide forward compatibility, sometimes words are reserved without having a current use (a reserved word that is not a keyword), as this allows the word to be used in future without breaking existing programs. Alternatively, new language features can be implemented as predefineds, which can be overridden, thus not breaking existing programs.Reasons for flexibility include allowing compiler vendors to extend the specification by including non-standard features, different standard dialects of language to extend it, or future versions of the language to include additional features. For example, a procedural language may anticipate adding object-oriented capabilities in a future version or some dialect, at which point one might add keywords like class or object. To accommodate this possibility, the current specification may make these reserved words, even if they are not currently used.A notable example is in Java, where const and goto are reserved words — they have no meaning in Java but they also cannot be used as identifiers. By reserving the terms, they can be implemented in future versions of Java, if desired, without breaking older Java source code. For example, there was a proposal in 1999 to add C++-like const to the language, which was possible using the const word, since it was reserved but currently unused; however, this proposal was rejected – notably because even though adding the feature would not break any existing programs, using it in the standard library (notably in collections) would break compatibility. JavaScript also contains a number of reserved words without special functionality; the exact list varies by version and mode.Languages differ significantly in how frequently they introduce new reserved words or keywords and how they name them, with some languages being very conservative and introducing new keywords rarely or never, to avoid breaking existing programs, while other languages introduce new keywords more freely, requiring existing programs to change existing identifiers that conflict. A case study is given by new keywords in C11 compared with C++11, both from 2011 – recall that in C and C++, identifiers that begin with an underscore followed by an uppercase letter are reserved:That is, C11 introduced the keyword _Thread_local within an existing set of reserved words (those with a certain prefix), and then used a separate facility (macro processing) to allow its use as if it were a new keyword without any prefixing, while C++11 introduce the keyword thread_local despite this not being an existing reserved word, breaking any programs that used this, but without requiring macro processing.Predefined names A related notion to reserved words are predefined functions, methods, subroutines, or variables, particularly library routines from the standard library. These are similar in that they are part of the basic language, and may be used for similar purposes. However, these differ in that the name of a predefined function, method, or subroutine is typically categorized as an identifier instead of a reserved word, and is not treated specially in the syntactic analysis. Further, reserved words may not be redefined by the programmer, but predefineds can often be overridden in some capacity.Languages vary as to what is provided as a keyword and what is a predefined. Some languages, for instance, provide keywords for input/output operations whereas in others these are library routines. In Python (versions earlier than 3.0) and many BASIC dialects, print is a keyword. In contrast, the C, Lisp, and Python 3.0 equivalents printf, format, and print are functions in the standard library. Similarly, in Python prior to 3.0, None, True, and False were predefined variables, but not reserved words, but in Python 3.0 they were made into reserved words.DefinitionSome use the terms 'keyword' and 'reserved word' interchangeably, while others distinguish usage, say by using 'keyword' to mean a word that is special only in certain contexts but 'reserved word' to mean a special word that cannot be used as a user-defined name. The meaning of keywords — and, indeed, the meaning of the notion of keyword — differs widely from language to language. Concretely, in ALGOL 68, keywords are stropped (in the strict language, written in bold) and are not reserved words – the unstropped word can be used as an ordinary identifier.The 'Java Language Specification' uses the term 'keyword'. The ISO 9899 standard for the C programming language uses the term 'keyword'.In many languages, such as C and similar environments like C++, a keyword is a reserved word which identifies a syntactic form. Words used in control flow constructs, such as if, then, and else are keywords. In these languages, keywords cannot also be used as the names of variables or functions.In some languages, such as ALGOL and Algol 68, keywords cannot be written verbatim, but must be stropped. This means that keywords must be marked somehow. E.g. by quoting them or by prefixing them by a special character. As a consequence, keywords are not reserved words, and thus the same word can be used for as a normal identifier. However, one stropping regime was to not strop the keywords, and instead have them simply be reserved words.Some languages, such as PostScript, are extremely liberal in this approach, allowing core keywords to be redefined for specific purposes.In Common Lisp, the term 'keyword' (or 'keyword symbol') is used for a special sort of symbol, or identifier. Unlike other symbols, which usually stand for variables or functions, keywords are self-quoting and self-evaluating:98 and are interned in the KEYWORD package. Keywords are usually used to label named arguments to functions, and to represent symbolic values.The symbols which name functions, variables, special forms and macros in the package named COMMON-LISP are basically reserved words. The effect of redefining them is undefined in ANSI Common Lisp. Binding them is possible. For instance the expression (if if case or) is possible, when if is a local variable. The leftmost if refers to the if operator; the remaining symbols are interpreted as variable names. Since there is a separate namespace for functions and variables, if could be a local variable. In Common Lisp, however, there are two special symbols which are not in the keyword package: the symbols t and nil.When evaluated as expressions, they evaluate to themselves. They cannot be used as the names of functions or variables, so are de facto reserved. (let ((t 42))) is a well-formed expression, but the let operator will not permit the usage.Typically, when a programmer attempts to use a keyword for a variable or function name, a compilation error will be triggered. In most modern editors, the keywords are automatically set to have a particular text colour to remind or inform the programmers that they are keywords.In languages with macros or lazy evaluation, control flow constructs such as if can be implemented as macros or functions. In languages without these expressive features, they are generally keywords.Comparison by languagesNot all languages have the same numbers of reserved words.For example, Java (and other C derivatives) has a rather sparse complement of reserved words—approximately 50 – whereas COBOL has approximately 400.At the other end of the spectrum, pure Prolog and PL/I have none at all.The number of reserved words in a language has little to do with how “powerful” a language is.COBOL was designed in the 1950s as a business language and was made to be self-documenting using English-like structural elements such as verbs, clauses, sentences, sections and divisions.C, on the other hand, was written to be very terse (syntactically) and to get more text on the screen.For example, compare the equivalent blocks of code from C and COBOL to calculate weekly earnings:// Calculation in C:if (salaried)amount = 40 * payrate;elseamount = hours * payrate;*> Calculation in COBOL:IF Salaried THENMULTIPLY Payrate BY 40 GIVING AmountELSEMULTIPLY Payrate BY Hours GIVING AmountEND-IF.*> Other example of calculation in COBOL:IF SalariedCOMPUTE Amount = Payrate * 40ELSECOMPUTE Amount = hours * payrateEND-IF.Pure Prolog logic is expressed in terms of relations, and execution is triggered by running queries over these relations.Constructs such as loops are implemented using recursive relationships.All three of these languages can solve the same types of “problems” even though they have differing numbers of reserved words.This “power” relates to their belonging to the set of Turing-complete languages.Disadvantages Definition of reserved words in a language raises problems.The language may be difficult for new users to learn because of a long list of reserved words to memorize which can't be used as identifiers.It may be difficult to extend the language because addition of reserved words for new features might invalidate existing programs or, conversely, 'overloading' of existing reserved words with new meanings can be confusing.Porting programs can be problematic because a word not reserved by one system/compiler might be reserved by another.Because reserved words cannot be used as identifiers, users may choose deliberate misspellings of reserved words as identifiers instead, such asfor Java variables of type .Reserved words and language independenceMicrosoft's .NETCommon Language Infrastructure (CLI) specification allows code written in 40+ different programming languages to be combined into a final product.Because of this, identifier/reserved word collisions can occur when code implemented in one language tries to execute code written in another language.For example, a Visual Basic.NET library may contain a class definition such as:' Class Definition of This in Visual Basic.NET:Public Class this' This class does something... End ClassIf this is compiled and distributed as part of a toolbox, a C# programmer, wishing to define a variable of type “this” would encounter a problem: 'this' is a reserved word in C#. Thus, the following will not compile in C#:// Using This Class in C#:this x = new this();// Won't compile!A similar issue arises when accessing members, overriding virtual methods, and identifying namespaces.This is resolved by stropping. In order to work around this issue, the specification allows the programmer to (in C#) place the at-sign before the identifier which forces it to be considered an identifier rather than a reserved word by the compiler:// Using This Class in C#:@this x = new @this();// Will compile!For consistency, this usage is also permitted in non-public settings such as local variables, parameter names, and private members.See alsoC reserved keywordsList of Java keywordsSymbol (programming)ReferencesProgramming constructs Programming language topics", "machine_text": " A reserved word or keyword is a special word or phrase in a computer language or other context, that has specific meanings and functions that must be used in the context of the particular type of language. Reserved words are typically language specific, and have special meaning to the language. In computer programming and scripting language, reserved words are used to specify the underlying syntax and semantics of the language. These words, while they vary slightly from language to language, generally have the same core meaning and serve the same purpose: to differentiate between the language's syntactic rules and runtime keywords. The terms 'reserve word' and 'keyword' are often used synonymously. Examples of commonly used reserved words are 'if', 'while', 'for', 'else', and 'print', which all have specific functions in the respective language. Other more specialized reserve words such as 'break' or 'continue' cause the looping structure in which they are placed to take specific action. Additionally, there are two types of language-specific reserved words, unparsed and parsed. Unparsed reserved words are words in a language which, when found during compilation or execution, are given special identification or instructions. For example, the word ‘for’ in a Java program would be flagged as an unparsed reserved word because the compiler would need to check for the underlying syntax of the for statement and pass instructions to the processor for the loop code it contains. Parsed reserved words, on the other hand, are used when a language contains some form of structured programming language such as Python or Ruby. When the program is being parsed, the parser will flag any parsed reserved words as having special meaning. In addition to their syntactic function, reserved words can be used as variables or as identifiers. For example, in C++ the keyword int is used to declare a variable as an integer. Conversely, 'int' can be used as an identifier, such as when used to name a function or class. In some languages, a certain number of additional reserved words may come into play over time by becoming part of the language's standard libraries or as part of advanced concepts. For example, in Java, the keyword 'super' is added to the suite of reserved words during advanced object-oriented development. In general, reserved words are a necessary byproduct of any structured programming language and serve mostly to enforce proper use of syntax during the development and running of code. Without them, the consistency of coding and debugging would be significantly more difficult and time consuming.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 49723}

They bespeak the inherent bigness and breadth of the scenes they represent so faithfully.'Historical informationThe Four Seasons murals were created as part of the 1914 City Hospital Mural Project in Indianapolis, Indiana. In 1911, Indianapolis City Hospital expanded by adding two dedicated patient buildings, the Burdsal Units. St. Margaret’s Hospital Guild, a local women’s volunteer group dedicated to supporting the City Hospital, donated money for decoration of the new wards, which resulted in the world's first large-scale mural project in a public hospital. Sixteen of Indiana’s “finest and most promising” artists, including Steele, were invited to contribute to the mural project. Despite the limited budget, Steele and the other artists committed to completing the project for the wages of a union house painter, approximately 75–100 per month.While the majority of artists worked on-site at the hospital, Steele painted the Four Seasons murals at his home, 'The House of the Singing Winds,' in Brown County, Indiana. Because the canvases and frameworks were so large, and his existing studio could not accommodate the space required, Steele painted the murals in his living room. In late 1914, before they were installed in the hospital, the Four Seasons murals were exhibited at the Herron Art Institute. Upon arrival at City Hospital, the four canvases were mounted to patient ward walls using a mixture of white lead and damar varnish. Once hung, the adhesive was further secured by covering the completed murals with thick layers of varnish.ConservationIn 1967, imminent renovation plans for the Burdsal units endangered the mural collection. Through a campaign organized by St. Margaret's Hospital Guild, Steele's murals were slated for conservation by the James G. Snodgrass Studio. The four murals were removed from the building's walls, mounted to masonite, restored, and displayed at the Indiana State Museum. With building renovations complete, in 1976, three of Steele's murals - Spring, Summer, and Autumn - were returned to the hospital, where they hung in conference rooms. The fourth mural, Winter, was gifted to the museum as a gesture of gratitude for the works' safekeeping.LocationThe Four Seasons mural fragments were reunited with the 2013 opening of a new Sidney and Lois Eskenazi Hospital campus and are part of the Eskenazi Health Art Collection. Winter is on loan for 99 years from the Indiana State Museum. The Four Seasons mural fragments are located in The Rapp Family Conference Center: Steele Corridor on the first floor of the SidneyLois Eskenazi Hospital and are 'Dedicated with gratitude, The Penrod Society.”ArtistTheodore Clement Steele (1847-1926) was an Impressionist painter known for his portraits and Indiana landscape paintings. Born and raised in Indiana, he studied at the Royal Academy when he and his family moved to Munich in 1879. Steele returned to Indiana in 1885 and was part of a group of well-known Indiana artists, the Hoosier Group. Among others, Steele’s work is included at the Haan Mansion Museum of Indiana Art, Indiana State Museum, Indianapolis Museum of Art, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and the Indiana University Art Museum in Bloomington, Indiana.See alsoEskenazi Health Art CollectionSidneyLois Eskenazi HospitalReferencesExternal linksEskenazi Health Art Installations (video)Eskenazi Health Art Collection 1914 paintings", "machine_text": " Four Seasons (murals) refers to a series of four fresco murals painted by Italian Baroque master Pietro da Cortona between 1638 and 1639. The murals depict the four allegorical figures of the Greek myths of the four seasons in each of the four corners of Sala dei Virtù e delle Alcove (Room of Virtues and Alcoves) in Palazzo Pamphilj, Rome. Three of the four frescoes are still intact, with the larger and more prominent painting on the east wall. The fresco murals are divided into four panels, each on a separate wall of the room in Palazzo Pamphilj. The central fresco, the dramatic and dynamic 'Autumn, is depicted on the east wall, while the other three, 'Spring', 'Summer' and 'Winter', are on the other walls. Each painting is an allegorical representation of the season it depicts: Autumn is colourful and festive, filled with singing and dancing farmers and revelers, while Winter shows a wintery landscape with a small nun praying in a forest and a poor beggar with his dog. Spring is a more serene composition, featuring a waterfall and a shepherd with a staff, while Summer is depicted as a bustling agricultural scene, with harvest ready crops and a farmer leading an enthusiastic team of workers. The murals display the characteristic Baroque style of the period and Cortona's dramatic compositions. His paintings have a distinct grandeur and drama, with their large canvases, strong diagonals and vivid, contrasting colours. Cortona's masterful brushwork can be seen in the lifelike details in the figures and the use of light and shadow to bring out their lively expressions and postures. The Frescoes are highly significant among Cortona's works, showcasing his acclaimed talents in painting monumental decorations for the wealthy clientele of Rome. The Four Seasons frescoes have been reproduced in numerous formats, including prints, engravings and ceramics, and are considered some of the most important murals in Roman Baroque art. They were declared a historic monument by the Italian government in 1921. The original fresco murals were rediscovered in 1896 and restored in 1938. The 'Spring' and 'Winter' frescoes are still largely complete and are displayed in the Pinacoteca at Palazzo Pamphilj, while the 'Summer' fresco is completely lost. The 'Autumn' fresco has been restored and is frequenty displayed in other venues such as the Palazzo Barberini and the Palazzo Pitti in Florence. The Four Seasons frescoes are considered one of the great masterpieces of the Baroque period and are amongst the most important mural decorations to have survived from the 17th century. They remain a testament to Pietro da Cortona's artistic genius and technical skill and continue to inspire admirers to this day.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 55217072}

In 1980 Bruce Fagan and his sister, Ida, donated the land to the New South Wales State Government. Hornsby Shire Council was appointed sole trustee. The park was officially opened by the Premier of New South Wales, Nick Greiner, MP on 5 November 1988.HistoryThe Fagan FamilyWilliam Fagan was a free settler who emigrated from Derry in Ireland who arrived in Sydney in 1848. He later married Ann Waddell and the couple had three sons and four daughters. After their marriage the Fagans purchasedof land in Arcadia, New South Wales and the family established a successful citrus orchard. They were pioneers in the citrus industry in Dural, Galston and Arcadia, on the north-western outskirts of Sydney. Two of William and Ann's sons, William and Samuel, worked in the family business and later began their own operation at Dural. In 1900, Samuel and his wife acquired land at Galston and conducted their business on the property. They constructed 'Netherby,' a house made of bricks that were hand made. The property was the largest orchard in Galston and had a sizable workforce.By the early 1930s, because of the arrival of the Great Depression, Samuel Fagan commenced to closed down his orchards. Bruce Fagan, the youngest child in the family, ran a herd of Jersey dairy cattle on the property after the closure of the orchard. He later added a dairy building to the property and commenced a renowned cattle breeding programme. In 1980 Bruce Fagan and his sister, Ida, donated the original property, 'Fagan Park,' to the Department of Lands. The Hornsby Shire Council was appointed as the sole trustee for the park. Before his death in 1984, Bruce Fagan was consulted regarding development plans for the site.Bicentennial ProjectThe Bicentenary of Australia was celebrated in 1988. It marked the occasion of the beginning of European settlement of Australia, with the arrival of the First Fleet of British convict ships at Sydney in 1788.

It is bordered by the Galston Gorge to the east, the suburb of Galston to the north, and Arcadia Street to the west. Originally a large private orchard and property, the park was purchased by Hornsby Shire Council in 1936 for use as a public park. The park includes mature eucalypt and introduced trees, a series of walking routes and trails, a community hall, a playground, an outdoor gym, a skate park, picnic tables and benches, and three 'Fagan Park Pools': a man-made freshwater lagoon, toilet facilities and BBQ areas. Fagan Park is home to a variety of fauna, including birds, bats, wallabies, snakes and water dragons. The park also houses many historic structures, including two railway cottages (1864), Fagan Windmill (1864), an old wool shed and various heritage buildings such as the old Fagan Farmhouse (1890), a general store (1890), an apple packing shed (1920) and a refreshment kiosk (1930). The park is named after Daniel Fagan, an Irish convict who was granted 35 acres in the Galston area in 1836. He established a successful orchard and kept cattle and horses, and the Fagan family owned the land until its purchase by the Hornsby Shire in 1936. Since its purchase by the Hornsby Shire, Fagan Park has become an important community asset and recreation space, offering activities and facilities such as picnics, bushwalking, bird watching, swimming, water sports and exercising.

The album is Beach House's first in three years and was preceded by the singles 'Alien' and 'Dive'. Upon its release, Elyria earned positive reviews from critics for its dreamy atmosphere, kaleidoscopic production, and intimate songwriting. Many reviewers described it as the band's most mature and complex work to date. The album's artwork is an original painting by musician and artist Edouard Malingue. The track listing sees Beach House exploring a variety of different sounds, ranging from the folk-influenced 'First Thing' to the psychedelic 'Dive' and the lush shoegazing anthem 'Lose Your Smile'. Throughout, Legrand's plaintive vocals and Scally's atmospheric guitar take center stage but the album is also strongly influenced by the band's love of vintage synth sounds. Highlights include the dreamy single “Alien” and the whimsical “Bluebird”. Overall, Elyria is a creative and diverse record that showcases Beach House at their most sonically adventurous.

She further claimed that he later visited her in May 2000 and poured acid on her, in the presence of her 5-year-old son from a different man.Khar claimed that the attacker was someone else with his name. He was acquitted of all charges in the incident. Younus was sent to Rome, Italy, for treatment by Tehmina Durrani, Khar's stepmother. Initially she was denied a visa, but under public pressure, she was allowed to leave for Italy. Durrani engaged the Italian cosmetic firm Saint Angelic and Italian government to treat her.

Initially unwilling to speak out against her attacker, Fakhra eventually made the courageous decision to beseech help from the public to bring her assailant to justice. In doing so, Fakhra bravely spoke out against acid violence and brought global attention to the issue of gender-based violence. Fakhra was born in 1971 in Karachi, Pakistan to a poor family of marginal workers. She moved to Rome, Italy at the age of 18 and eventually met and married Bilal Khar, a wealthy Pakistani politician from the Khar family. A few years into their marriage, Bilal allegedly became emotionally and physically abusive and ultimately attacked Fakhra with acid while they were visiting Pakistan in 2000. The attack left Fakhra with extreme physical scars and emotional trauma. Fakhra escaped back to Rome and sought Italian citizenship, but was unable to rebuild her life until she gained access to essential medical care. In 2002, she finally persuaded a lawyer to take her case and went public for the first time with her story. Despite much scrutiny and backlash, Fakhra was eventually able to gain access to psychological support and obtain the necessary reconstructive surgeries through generous donations from the public. Fakhra received continuous support from lawyer and human rights activist Zahida Parveen, who wrote a moving, heart-wrenching article about Fakhra's plight. After years of struggle, she eventually divorced her husband and returned to Pakistan in August 2005 for a visit. Unfortunately, however, Fakhra was unable to find closure or justice and Bilal Khar was never convicted of his crime. Fakhra suffered greatly in the aftermath of her attack. Due to her physical injuries, she suffered from constant physical pain, while her emotional wounds kept her from finding happiness. Tragically, Fakhra committed suicide at the age of 40 after years of hope for justice continually eluded her. Despite this tragedy, Fakhra's story continues to bring global attention to the issue of acid violence and gender-based violence. It serves as a reminder to the importance of raising public awareness to stop such horrific crimes. Fakhra left behind a legacy of courage and resilience; a legacy that continues to spread awareness and empower those who have experienced similar types of violence.

Our idea was to endeavour to get large numbers of young men drawn from the aristocracy and country gentlemen who would devote themselves to the cause and fight constituencies wherever and whenever they were required'. At their height they numbered around 50 members, with 30 entering Parliament, 9 gaining office and 4 becoming Cabinet ministers. Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland was a member. Edward Goulding was closely connected with the Confederacy.The first meetings were held at Fanhams Hall.

It was founded in 1792 by Thomas Biddulph and John Fenton, who wanted to secure the future of the British monarchy. They were the forerunners of the Tory Party. The Confederacy was built upon two main concepts: a belief in the superiority of the British government, and an opposition to the Radical movement that had arisen in the wake of the French Revolution. The group sought to preserve the established order, including the House of Commons, the Houses of Lords and the common law. To this end, the Confederacy sought to forestall any further political change by using its influence in Parliament to prevent the passing of radical reforms and to oppose what it perceived as a weakening of national security. The Confederation also supported a number of established practices, including the continuation of hereditary privilege, the subordination of colonial territories, and the maintenance of an hierarchical social structure. The Confederacy was not a political party; it was an informal network of political operators, united only by their shared adherence to conservative ideals. Its members were mostly Conservative politicians, but also included many Dissenters and members of the aristocracy. Members of the group enjoyed considerable influence and power in the post-revolutionary era, and their views often had an impact on the development of British politics, economics, and social policy. The influence of the Confederacy began to wane in the early 19th century, as reformist movements gained momentum and the Tory Party became the dominant force in British politics. The dissolution of the Confederacy in 1802 signaled the end of its era of political significance. Nevertheless, its conservative legacy was felt for many decades, serving to define a distinctively conservative position in British politics and to shape the reactions of many prominent Tories to the ideas of the 19th and early 20th centuries.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 41570151}

Women were given aide after the Société had investigated them through visit and inspection, and approved of them as worthy of help.The Société belonged to a then new and modern trend of private secular charity organizations. These were to become typical in the 19th-century, but in the 18th-century they were fairly new, since charity and social help had normally been managed by the church until then. It was also a pioneer innovation in the fact that the Société was managed exclusively by women and thus were a secular women's organization in a time period when women's organizations had until then normally been religious.The Société was closed in 1793 during the Reign of Terror, but reopened in 1801.

Examples include Lieutenant-General Sir Robert Fry, Lieutenant-General Sir James Dutton and Lieutenant-General Sir David Capewell.Royal Air Force usage From 1 April 1918 to 31 July 1919, the Royal Air Force maintained the rank of lieutenant general. It was superseded by the rank of air marshal on the following day. Although Sir David Henderson was an RAF lieutenant general, the then RAF Chief-of-Staff Sir Hugh Trenchard never held this rank. Additionally, the retired Royal Navy admiral John de Mestre Hutchison held an honorary RAF commission in the rank of lieutenant general.The RAF lieutenant general rank insignia was similar to the naval rank insignia for a vice-admiral, with a broad band of gold being worn on the cuff with two narrower bands above it. Unlike the naval insignia, the RAF lieutenant general insignia did not have an executive curl.See alsoBritish and U.S. military ranks compared British Army Other Ranks rank insignia British Army officer rank insigniaReferencesMilitary ranks of the British Army Military ranks of the Royal Marines Former military ranks of the Royal Air Force", "machine_text": " Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom) is a senior rank in the British Army, ranking just below General. It is the equivalent of Vice Admiral in the Royal Navy and Air Marshal in the Royal Air Force. The rank of Lieutenant-general was created in the late 16th century and was granted to officers who commanded a division (a maneuver unit of approximately 10,000 soldiers) or a lieutenant-general who commanded multiple divisions. The rank has since come to be regarded as one of the more senior ranks of the British Army, and holders of the rank may be awarded specific responsibilities and privileges as determined by the Army. Lieutenant-generals remain at the apex of the British military hierarchy, only outranked by the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the British Army. Lieutenant-generals are usually granted the most senior roles within the British Army, with responsibilities such as leading large-scale campaigns and operations, providing strategic guidance to a Commander-in-Chief, and managing the operational tempo of a Theatre of Operations. On occasions, the rank may also be granted to officers who command the HQ of a Command or Areas such as UK Land Forces or the Administrative Command of the Army. On such an occasion, they may be granted the permanent additional rank of General and may be referred to as 'Lieutenant-Generals and Generals of Administration'. The rank of Lieutenant-general is also commonly used as a slightly lower-level post or branch-of-service headquarters. For example, the Commander of the Royal Artillery will normally hold the rank of Lieutenant-general. Rising to the rank of Lieutenant-general is generally considered an extremely prestigious achievement, although currently, the rank is somewhat smaller than it once was. The rank of Lieutenant-general is only ever awarded in recognition of the highest level of senior responsibility and has only ever been conferred to the most experienced and capable of officers. Lieutenant-generals have a broad ravel of honorary titles, including Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) and Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB). Additionally, Lieutenant-generals may also receive foreign awards such as the US Legion of Merit, French Order of the Legion of Honour and German Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 3820095}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Death to 2020\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Death to 2020 is a 2020 mockumentary by Black Mirror creators Charlie Brooker and Annabel Jones under their Broke and Bones production company as a Netflix original production. The special features a series of fictional characters discussing US and UK events of 2020 including the COVID-19 pandemic and US presidential election. It was released on Netflix on 27 December 2020. The mockumentary received mostly negative critical reception, with reviewers criticising the jokes as obvious, though some of the cast performances were praised. A sequel special, Death to 2021, was released on December 27, 2021.Synopsis In mockumentary format, characters discuss events of 2020 with a mixture of true information and satire. The overarching topic is the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the US and UK. The 2020 United States presidential election is also heavily featured. Events in the early part of the year include the latter part of the 2019–20 Australian bushfire season, Greta Thunberg's environmental speeches at the World Economic Forum, Prince Harry and his wife Meghan stepping down from the British royal family and the 2020 Oscars. The May 2020 murder of George Floyd and subsequent US protests are summarized, with commentary on the Donald Trump photo op at St. John's Church and protesters removing the statue of Edward Colston in Bristol, England.On the topic of the pandemic, characters comment on the 2020 royal addresses to the nation in the UK, two national lockdowns in England, online circulation of false information, vaccine trials and the first uses of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine outside of a clinical trial. With regards to the US election, topics under discussion include acquittal of the impeached Donald Trump, Democratic primaries between Bernie Sanders and the successful Joe Biden, presidential debates between Biden and Trump, The New York Times reports on Trump's tax returns and Biden's choice of Kamala Harris as running mate. After Biden won the election, Trump attempted to overturn results with a series of false claims and unsuccessful lawsuits.The mockumentary closes with characters delivering lines that jokingly predict events of 2021.CastSamuel L.

He had created a special Antiviral Wipe earlier in 2020 at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Brooker saw Death to 2020 as different to his previous topical comedy, as it is 'more character-based' and he does not serve as presenter. He also described it as 'sillier', summarising it as 'part record of the year, part spoof documentary and part character comedy'.It is produced by Broke and Bones, which Brooker and Annabel Jones founded after departing from House of Tomorrow, the production company they had worked with for the Endemol Shine group in producing Black Mirror. The two reportedly left House of Tomorrow over intellectual property rights issues. Netflix has a deal for exclusive rights over Broke and Bones productions. Death to 2020 is its first full production after the co-production Antiviral Wipe.The special was written with a team of writers over four months. It was filmed in late November across 10 days, in London and Los Angeles. Minimal crews were used due to the pandemic, with some actors in production bubbles. Each actor filmed for only one day. The Los Angeles filming shortly preceded a local lockdown there. Unlike Wipe specials, Brooker does not appear on-screen, but plays a director asking the talking heads questions. This decision was made partially because of an expectation that non-UK audiences would not be familiar with his appearance. Additionally, Diane Morgan appears in a different role—rather than recurring Wipe character Philomena Cunk, she plays Gemma Nerrick, ostensibly 'one of the five most average people in the world'. Cristin Milioti previously starred in Black Mirror episode 'USS Callister'.Actors influenced their characters' portrayal, with Brooker highlighting Kudrow in particular as having a number of things she felt strongly about. To appeal to a global audience, UK subjects such as the Dominic Cummings scandal were avoided. News of Biden's win and the Pfizer vaccine rollout arrived days before filming. Brooker and Jones were both involved with the editing process.Actor Hugh Grant revealed the project's existence in an interview with New York magazine in late November 2020, saying Brooker had written a mockumentary about the year 2020, which was dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic and described by some as a real-life version of a Black Mirror episode. Brooker said Grant would play the role of a historian who's being interviewed about the year. Further details of the special were announced in early December 2020, including many of the principal cast.ReceptionCritics branded the mockumentary as 'disappointing', and compared it unfavourably to Charlie Brooker's Screenwipe and Black Mirror. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes,ofcritic reviews are positive, with an average rating of . According to Metacritic, which calculated an average score of 41 out of 100 based on 11 critics, it received 'mixed or average reviews'.In a one star review for The Independent, Ed Cumming found that he was often 'waiting for punchlines that never arrive', saying that Grant is 'not given a single decent line'. Cumming criticised the absence of Brooker's narration, as found in the Wipe series, and wrote that the work 'can't make up its mind whether it is for a British audience or an American one'.Chris Bennion gave the special two stars out of five in a review for The Telegraph, believing it to be a 'huge disappointment' in which the humour is 'as predictable as the targets of the jokes'. Though reporting that most of the jokes are 'at best wearily familiar', Bennion did find a few that 'carry Brooker's acidic wit and giddy surrealism' and praised that Grant 'adroitly captures the pomposity of the Grand Old TV Don'. Another two star review came from Evening Standards Nancy Durrant, who found it 'not as good' as the Wipe specials. Durrant opined that a runtime of 45 minutes 'would have been quite enough'. Durrant praised Grant, Kudrow, Milioti and Morgan and the characters' names, along with some small jokes.Though praising some of the characters, including Jackson, Fishburne and Milioti, Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B– in a negative review which summarised the mockumentary as 'obvious jokes over familiar footage'. Handlen found nothing 'particularly insightful' and criticised 'a few lame stabs at 'both-sides-ing' the polarization of American politics'. The Hollywood Reporters Daniel Fienberg summarised the work as a 'generally hacky piece of recycled political satire and tired documentary parody'. Finding it 'astonishing how lazy everything is', he viewed it as worse than many American topical comedies and said that the humour comes 'almost exclusively from the enthusiasm of an impressively star-studded cast'. However, Fienberg praised Milioti and Morgan and found it 'appropriate' that Jackson discusses most of the George Floyd protest content with 'only anger and outrage'. The Los Angeles Times called the mockumentary a 'bitingly funny, hastily assembled and slightly deranged comedic retrospective'.SequelA programme in the same style, Death to 2021, aired on 27 December 2021, produced by Broke and Bones. Alongside returning cast such as Grant, Ullman and Morgan, the mockumentary starred new members including Lucy Liu, Stockard Channing and William Jackson Harper. According to Digital Spy, Brooker had a reduced role, not participating as executive producer due to work on other projects. Instead, the executive producers were Jones and Ben Caudell—a writer for Cunk on Britain, a programme starring Morgan's character Philomena Cunk. The special was directed by Jack Clough and Josh Ruben.ReferencesExternal links2020 2020 films Films set in 2020 English-language Netflix original films 2020s mockumentary films Works by Charlie Brooker", "machine_text": " Death to 2020 is a mockumentary comedy special released on Netflix and created by the British production company Black Mirror.The production debuted on December 27, 2020 and stars a large ensemble cast, including Hugh Grant, Lisa Kudrow, Kumail Nanjiani, Tracey Ullman, Samuel L. Jackson, Diane Morgan, Leslie Jones, Cristin Milioti , Samson Kayo,Joe Cole, and Nikki Amuka-Bird. The special follows a narrator (played by Grant) as he looks back on the year 2020 in an attempt to make sense of the unprecedented events that defined it. He narrates various anecdotes, mostly uncensored and outrageous, about the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the Black Lives Matter movement, the 2020 presidential election and other topics. The mockumentary features a number of inventive 'interviews' that further illustrate the tone of the miniseries. These interviews include the fictional Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (Ullman), the first 'Space Lord' from the United States (Jackson), a conspiracy theorist (Nanjiani), and politician/activists Beverly Prim (Morgan) and Dorsey Mellon (Jones). Death to 2020 has been highly praised by critics. Variety described the mockumentary as a 'hilarious and clever look back on this unique year in history,' with Jackson calling Grant's performance 'perfect.' The Guardian described the series as a 'welcome shot of comic relief' to an otherwise wild ride of a year. The special also includes an original song titled '2020 year in 2 minutes' written by Deepak Ramapriyan and Jonnie Christie. Following the success of Death to 2020, Netflix has announced plans for a second special. Overall, Death to 2020 serves as an entertaining and comedic look back at a year that few of us would soon forget. As the year comes to a close, this clever mockumentary offers viewers a humorous way to reflect on the events that defined 2020.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 66015894}

Through his research on the history of psychoanalysis in Sweden, Johansson has contributed to the understanding of the heritage of Sigmund Freud and the psychoanalytical movement in the 20th century. Johansson's psychoanalytical training took place in Paris, where he completed a training analysis with Pierre Legendre.In the book En psykoanalytikers väg (The Path of a Psychoanalyst) Johansson is interviewed about his life and work. The book includes a French translation, Le cheminement d'un psychanalyste and a foreword by Elisabeth Roudinesco.Research on the history of psychoanalysisJohanssons monographs are mainly written in Swedish, but his work has reached an international audience through articles in encyclopedias and journals within the field of psychoanalysis.Johansson is an associate professor in the History of Ideas at the University of Gothenburg where he in 1999 submitted his doctoral thesis. The title of his thesis was Freuds psykoanalys (Freud's Psychoanalysis). Each of the pioneers of psychoanalysis in Sweden, Poul Bjerre, Emanuel af Geijerstam, Pehr Henrik Törngren, Ola Andersson, Lajos Székely and Carl Lesche, has a chapter devoted to them. In 2003, Johansson published Freuds psykoanalys. Band 3. Arvtagare i Sverige. Del 2 (Freud's Psychoanalysis. Vol 3. Heirs in Sweden Part 2). In this volume, Alfhild Tamm, Gunnar Nycander, Gösta Harding and Stefi Pedersen, likewise are given their own chapters.Having thus described the reception of Freud and psychoanalysis from a Swedish perspective, Johansson devoted a fourth volume (2009) to the situation of psychiatry and clinical psychology in Gothenburg.Together with the French psychoanalyst and historian Elisabeth Roudinesco, Johansson has introduced the Swedish psychoanalyst and researcher Ola Andersson in France. He has also critically read and introduced the Swedish translations of several texts by Sigmund Freud and Michel Foucault.Psychoanalysis and the Humanities, a collection of essays, was published in 2014.

The genus consists of 33 species in total, the majority of which belong to the subtribe Senecioneae. The common name “cineraria” is derived from the Latin word “cinerarius” which means “ash-colored”, referring to the greyish-white hairs that can be found on the leaves of the genus. Most species of cineraria are semi-deciduous shrubs, ranging in size from 0.5 to 3 m tall. The leaves are opposite in arrangement, with simple to lobed margins. The flowers are daisy-like and range in color from pink to white, often having a yellow or purple center. They are followed by long, cylinder-like fruits that contain the many small seeds characteristic to this genus. Cinerarias are cultivated for their beautiful flowers and ability to attract wildlife, such as butterflies and hummingbirds. The leaves of the plants can also be used for gardening, as a natural pesticide and insect repellent. Cineraria species have the ability to fix nitrogen, which helps to make soil more fertile and productive. This makes them a valuable crop to farmers, particularly in under-developed countries suffering from nitrogen-depleted soils. Some species of cineraria are cultivated as ornamentals. The annual Cineraria maritima, common name dustymiller, has been cultivated extensively since the 17th century both as a cut flower and as a bedding plant. They are also used in many herbaceous borders. Other species are grown as food, mainly as spinach and salad greens. The leaves of some species have edible flowers, and the roots can be eaten, boiled or steamed. Cineraria is an ancient genus and has been used for centuries for medicinal purposes. Leaves and roots are dried and used in tinctures and decoctions to treat skin diseases, bruises and sores. The plant is also believed to possess anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties. The three main species of cineraria used medicinally are Senecio macroglossus, Senecio pinnatifidus and Senecio sessilifolius.

It was named after his birth year in the Tibetan calendar.Recording and music The album was produced by Alan Douglas and recorded at Sound Mixers, New York City. All of the tracks except 'Laura' were composed by McIntyre. The final track, 'Someday', was taken from a June 11, 1962 session involving trombonist John Mancebo Lewis, but although he is mentioned on the sleeve this was in fact the only track from that session on which he did not play. A second session, on August 31, yielded 'Cosmos', played by McIntyre with Jaki Byard (piano), Ron Carter (bass), and Louis Hayes (drums). For the final session, four days later, Hayes was replaced by Ben Riley, and the remaining four tracks on the album were recorded.Releases Year of the Iron Sheep was released on LP by United Artists. It was later combined with another album and additional tracks on the 2-CD set The Complete United Artists Sessions.Reception Billboard selected the album as a 'special merit pick', commenting that 'McIntyre's work on alto and flute is exciting and lyrical, and worth hearing as a new direction in scored jazz.'Track listing All compositions by Ken McIntyre except where noted.'Say What' – 5:00'Arisin'' – 10:10'Laura' (David Raksin, Johnny Mercer) – 3:25'96.5' – 4:10'Cosmos' – 5:15'Someday' – 8:47PersonnelTracks 1–4 Ken McIntyre – alto sax, flute Jaki Byard – piano Ron Carter – bass Ben Riley – drumsTrack 5 Ken McIntyre – alto sax Jaki Byard – piano Ron Carter – bass Louis Hayes – drumsTrack 6 Ken McIntyre – flute Ed Stoute – piano Ahmed Abdul-Malik – bass Warren Smith – drums (Trombonist John M.

Every year, people from all over the world gather to celebrate our beloved Popeye and all that he stands for, representing courage, determination, and resilience. Popeye was an optimistic sponge-o-logist in a can, who found himself capable of achieving more than he had ever though possible. The Year of the Iron Sheep is held in April in commemoration of Popeye’s first appearance on April 19, 1929. Each year, the celebration includes an array of cultural and educational activities. Some of the highlights include a Popeye cartoon Marathons, a Popeye Voice Olympics, and a Popeye Costume Competition. The event is best known for its street fairs held in many major cities in the U.S. This year, the fairs have been held in New York City and San Francisco, among other cities. During the main event, The Year of the Iron Sheep encourages everyone to dress up as Popeye in honor of the character, showing solidarity with his spirit. Family activities such as Popeye-themed yoga classes, Popeye-themed puppet shows, and other interactive games and activities are offered to honor Popeye’s legacy. One of the most meaningful activities is the community-wide “Go Vegan” day. As Popeye was a vegetarian, the many supporters of this event choose to remember him in a healthier, more sustainable way. Several restaurants offer discounts to those participating in this activity. Similarly, the Father and Son of Spinach Award is an annual recognition of a father-son pair that has helped to alleviate underprivileged children in their community. The event has spawned a large industry selling memorabilia related to Popeye. Items such as t-shirts, mugs, jewelry, and other collectibles featuring Popeye are hot cakes among fans of the cartoon character. Music, books, and movies devoted to Popeye can also be found. The celebration of Popeye and his memory has become a yearly tradition that unites fans worldwide. The Year of the Iron Sheep not only brings joy and happiness to many, but also reminds us to always remain optimistic and never give up.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 54465934}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Mountains and hills of England\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The mountains and hills of England comprise very different kinds of terrain, from a mountain range which reaches almosthigh, to several smaller areas of lower mountains, foothills and sea cliffs. Most of the major upland areas have been designated as Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) or national parks. The highest and most extensive areas are in the north and west (including south-west), while the midlands, south-east and east of the country tend to be low-lying.EnglandThe Kents (England's 1,000-Foot Hills) The highest 3,805 hills in England, all of those between 1,000.00 feet and 1,999.99 feet, are identified and listed in the England's 1,000-Foot Peaks book, by Jeff Kent, which was published in 2021. The author called the peaks, as an entity, The Kents in honour of his parents. There are 3,805 Complete Kents and 1,640 Greater Kents, which have a relative height of at least fifty feet. All the Kents have a rank, height (in feet and metres) and a grid reference of their summits. The highest Complete Kent is Tynehead Fell, in Cumbria, at 1,999.67 feet (609.50 metres) and the tallest Greater Kent is Slack's Ridge, in the same shire, with an altitude of 1,995.41 feet (608.20 metres). The Kents are spread across 18 English ceremonial counties. Cumbria contains the most 1,000-foot peaks, with 929 Complete Kents and 389 Greater Kents, and Gloucestershire the fewest, with 5 Complete Kents and 4 Greater Kents.Northern EnglandLake DistrictThe North of England includes the country's highest mountains, in the Lake District of Cumbria. This was one of the first national parks to be established in the United Kingdom, in 1951. The highest peak is Scafell Pike, , and at least three other summits exceedmaking them Furth Munros. The mountains are chiefly Ordovician slates and volcanic rocks, with some limestone and outcrops of other rock types. The peaks were catalogued and described in Alfred Wainwright's seminal Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells series of books, which listed 214 summits, which have subsequently become known as Wainwrights.Cheviot Hills North of Hadrian's Wall and the Tyne Valley, the land rises to form the Cheviot Hills, which extend into Scotland and could probably be considered part of either the Southern Uplands or the northern Pennines. They are included in Northumberland National Park, along with Kielder Water and the Kielder Forest.PenninesThe North Pennines (an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, or AONB) lie south of Hadrian's Wall, and east of the Lake District, from which they are separated by the Eden Valley. These are younger rocks, mostly Carboniferous limestone, and the mountains are characterised by shallower slopes covered with moorland vegetation, culminating in Cross Fell at .South of this, the main line of the Pennines (often called 'the backbone of England') continues into the Yorkshire Dales, a limestone-dominated area of broad valleys and moorland. The Yorkshire Three Peaks are some of the highest summits in the area, which became a national park in 1954.The Yorkshire Dales end at Skipton, and a short distance to the south is a range of moors that rises up between the urban cores of Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire. The range has no continuous name - the western part as far as Blackburn is called the West Pennine Moors, the eastern part north of the A646 (including the famous Ilkley Moor) is called the South Pennines, and the small area in between is known as the Forest of Rossendale. These three groups of hills are dominated by peat bogs over Millstone Grit, and merge into the northern part of the Peak District, known as the Dark Peak. These areas of West Yorkshire are marketed as 'Brontë country', and the local landscape provided inspiration for many of the works of the Brontë sisters, including most famously, Wuthering Heights.The Forest of Bowland AONB, in Lancashire is a western spur of the Pennines. It is separated from the surrounding Yorkshire Dales and South Pennines by the Aire Gap and Ribble Valley. The isolated Pendle Hill falls within the boundaries of the AONB.The Peak District was another of the original national parks designated in 1951, and remains one of the most popular in the country, largely because of its proximity to several large cities. One end of the Pennine Way, the first long-distance footpath in the British Isles, is in Edale, in the Peak District, while the other end is at Kirk Yetholm, in the Southern Uplands of Scotland.The southern part of the Peak District (White Peak), around Buxton and the Hope Valley, is another limestone area, with a number of caves, especially around Castleton. The Peak District marks the southern end of the Pennine chain, as it peters out into the lowlands of the English Midlands.Howgill Fells The Howgill Fells are an area of uplands in Cumbria lying between the Lake District and the Yorkshire Dales. The area falls within the boundaries of the Yorkshire Dales National Park and are sometimes considered as a western spur of the Pennines.Orton Fells The Orton Fells are an area of limestone uplands in Cumbria lying between the Lake District and the Eden Valley. The area mostly falls within the boundaries of the Yorkshire Dales National Park with a small part lying in the Lake District National Park. Like the Howgill Fells, the area may be considered a western spur of the Pennines as it predominantly lies in the Yorkshire Dales National Park.North York Moors Near the North Yorkshire coastal towns of Whitby and Scarborough, and extending inland as far as Thirsk, the North York Moors are one of the few major upland areas in eastern England. Reaching a maximum height ofat Urra Moor, the North York Moors are home to the RAF Fylingdales radar base. The Jurassic limestone rocks are rich in fossils, which are regularly exposed by erosion of the sea cliffs.MidlandsThe English Midlands are predominantly flat in character, although isolated hills such as Turners Hill can command extensive views. Upland areas lie to the north and west, with parts of the Peak District extending to the north while the Shropshire Hills in the west, close to the Welsh border, reach heights of over , including the Long Mynd, Clee Hills and Stiperstones ridge. Wenlock Edge, running through the middle of the Shropshire Hills AONB, is a long, low ridge, which extends for over . Further south, the Welsh border reaches overhigh, at Black Mountain, which is thus the highest point in Herefordshire.The Malverns are made from some of the oldest rock in England (around 680 million years old) and extend somethrough two West Midlands counties Worcestershire and Herefordshire as well as northern Gloucestershire in the southwest. The highest point of the hills is the Worcestershire Beacon atabove sea level (OS Grid reference SO768452).The Cotswolds extend over , and over six counties (Oxfordshire, Gloucestershire, Wiltshire, Somerset, Warwickshire and Worcestershire), but centred on Gloucestershire. They reachhigh at Cleeve Hill, and were designated an AONB in 1966.Areas of lower hills in the Midlands include Cannock Chase in Staffordshire, Charnwood Forest in Leicestershire and the Lincolnshire Wolds.South East England South East England, including East Anglia and London, is also predominantly flat. The underlying rock is chalk, and meaningful heights are only attained in the Chiltern Hills (Haddington Hill: ), the North Wessex Downs (Walbury Hill: ), the North Downs (Leith Hill: ) and the South Downs (which includes the chalk cliffs at Beachy Head and Seven Sisters).South West EnglandSouth of Bristol and Bath, the Mendip Hills (Black Down: ) are the first group of hills in South West England. The Purbeck Hills (and their continuation onto the Isle of Wight) line the south coast, and a number of other groups of hills are also present in the area: the Quantock Hills (Will's Neck: ), Blackdown Hills, Dorset Downs, Salisbury Plain and Cranborne Chase. Glastonbury Tor, although of only modest height (), is significant for its claimed association with Arthurian legend.The highest and largest upland areas in the south-west are, however, the moors of the South-west Peninsula. Exmoor, in northern Somerset, and abutting the Bristol Channel, reachesat Dunkery Beacon, and is famous as the setting of Lorna Doone. Dartmoor, in Devon, reaches over(High Willhays: ), and was the landscape for The Hound of the Baskervilles.Bodmin Moor, further to the south-west, is smaller (Brown Willy: ), and is perhaps best known for the Beast of Bodmin Moor. Like Dartmoor, it is a granite plateau, whereas Exmoor is formed from Devonian sediments.See also Hill lists in the British Isles List of English counties by highest point List of Hewitts and Nuttalls in EnglandReferences", "machine_text": " Mountains and hills of England are a range of elevations in the form of hills and mountains in the nation of England.

To do this, Dallara worked to reduce the weight of the chassis as much as possible, allowing Haas more freedom in using ballast to influence the car's weight distribution.The car was subject to scrutiny following its performances in pre-season testing and free practice sessions at the 2018 Australian Grand Prix. Questions were raised over similarities between the VF-18 and the Ferrari SF70H, the car entered by Haas' partner Ferrari inas the sporting and technical regulations ban the use of 'customer cars', or cars developed by one constructor and sold on to another team. Team principal Gunther Steiner dismissed the claims, responding to critics by arguing that the team had only purchased parts from Ferrari that the FIA had approved for sale.

It was unveiled online on February 5, 2018, and made its track debut during pre-season testing on February 26-March 1. It is driven by drivers Romain Grosjean and Kevin Magnussen, both of whom are returning to the team for a third consecutive year. The team finished eighth in the Constructors' standings, achieving its best ever result in Formula One. The car's chassis is designated the VF-18 and is similar to its predecessor, the VF-17. It was designed by a team of engineers led by technical director Guenther Steiner and chief designer Rob Taylor. Steiner commented in the car's launch statement that the engineers aimed to improve its balance and mechanical grip to increase the driver's confidence. Under the regulations, the VF-18 had to comply with the minimum weight of 728 kg, including the driver, fuel and lubricants, for the season. It was designed to accommodate the introducing of halo head protection device as well as Pirelli's wider tyres for the season. Its suspension setup consists of push-rod activation with rockers. The VF-18 is powered by a Ferrari 062 power unit which is mated to an uprated version of the seven-speed SS357 semi-automatic transmission used by the previous car. It is reported to generate over 900 bhp in qualifying and around 850 bhp in races.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Mohicans\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Mohican ( or , alternate spelling: Mahican) are an Eastern Algonquian Native American tribe that historically spoke an Algonquian language. As part of the Eastern Algonquian family of tribes, they are related to the neighboring Lenape, who occupied territory to the south as far as the Atlantic coast. The Mohican occupied the upper tidal Hudson River Valley, including the confluence of the Mohawk River (where present-day Albany, New York, developed) and into western New England centered on the upper Housatonic River watershed. After 1680, due to conflicts with the powerful Mohawk to the west during the Beaver Wars, many were driven southeastward across the present-day Massachusetts western border and the Taconic Mountains to Berkshire County around Stockbridge, Massachusetts.They combined with Lenape Native Americans (a branch known as the Munsee) in Stockbridge, and later the people moved west away from pressure of European settlement. They settled in what became Shawano County, Wisconsin. Most eastern American Indian populations were forced to reservations in Indian Territory during the 1830s, and other reservations in the American West later. Decades later they eventually formed the federally recognized Stockbridge-Munsee Community with registered members of the Munsee people and have areservation.Following the disruption of the American Revolutionary War, most of the Mohican descendants first migrated westward to join the Iroquois Oneida on their reservation in central New York. The Oneida gave them about 22,000 acres for their use. After more than two decades, in the 1820s and 1830s, the Oneida and the Stockbridge moved again, pressured to sell their lands and relocate to northeastern Wisconsin under the federal Indian Removal program. A group of Mohican also migrated to Ontario, Canada to live with the predominately Iroquois Six Nations of the Grand River reserve.The tribe identified by the place where they lived:(or 'people of the continually flowing waters'). The wordrefers to a great sea or body of water, and the Hudson River reminded them of their place of origin, so they named the Hudson River , or the river where there are people from the continually flowing waters. Therefore, they, along with other tribes living along the Hudson River (such as the Munsee to their west, known by the dialect of Lenape that they spoke, and Wappinger) to the south, were called 'the River Indians' by the Dutch and English.The Dutch heard and transliterated the term for the people of the area in their own language, variously as: Mahigan, Mahikander, Mahinganak, Maikan and Mawhickon, among other variants, which the English later expressed as Mohican or Mahican, in a transliteration to their own spelling system. The French, adopting names used by their Indian allies in Canada, knew the Mohican as the(or wolves). They referred to the Iroquois Confederacy as the 'Snake People', as they were called by some competitors, or 'Five Nations', representing their original tribes).Like the Munsee and Wappinger peoples, the Mohican were Algonquian-speaking, part of a large language family related also to the Lenape people, who occupied coastal areas from western Long Island to the Delaware River valley to the south.In the late twentieth century, the Mohican joined other former New York tribes, including the Oneida and some other Iroquois nations, in filing land claims against New York for what were considered unconstitutional purchases of their lands after the Revolutionary War. Only the federal government had constitutional authority to deal with the Indian nations. In 2010, outgoing governor David Paterson announced a land exchange with the Stockbridge-Munsee that would enable them to build a large casino onin Sullivan County in the Catskills, as a settlement in exchange for dropping their larger claim in Madison County. The deal had many opponents.Territory In their own language, the Mohican identified collectively as the , 'people of the great tidal river'.At the time of their first contact with Europeans traders along the river in the 1590s, the Mohican were living in and around the Hudson River (or ). After 1609, at the time of the Dutch settlement of New Netherland, they also ranged along the eastern Mohawk River and the Hoosic River, and south along the Hudson to the Roeliff Jansen Kill, where they bordered on the Wappinger people. This nation inhabited the river area and its interior southward to today's New York City.Most of the Mohican communities lay along the upper tidal reaches of the Hudson River and along the watersheds of Kinderhook-Claverack-Taghkanic Creek, the Roeliff Jansen Kill, Catskil Creek, and adjacent areas of the Housatonic watershed. Mohican territory reached along Hudson River watersheds northeastward to Wood Creek just south of Lake Champlain.Culture The Mohican villages were governed by hereditary sachems advised by a council of clan elders. They had a matrilineal kinship system, with property and inheritance (including such hereditary offices) passed through the maternal line. Moravian missionary John Heckewelder and early anthropologist Lewis H. Morgan both learned from Mohican informants that their matrilineal society was divided into three phratries (Turkey, Turtle, and Wolf). These were divided into clans or subclans, including a potentially prominent Bear Clan. This finding is supported by the evidence of Mohican signatures on treaties and land deeds (see the works of Shirley Dunn).A general council of sachems met regularly at Scodac (east of present-day Albany) to decide important matters affecting the entire confederacy. In his history of the Indians of the Hudson River, Edward Manning Ruttenber described the clans of the Mohican as the Bear, the Turkey, the Turtle, and the Wolf. Each had a role in the lives of the people, and the Wolf served as warriors in the north to defend against the Mohawk, the easternmost of the Five Nations of the Iroquois.Like the Munsee-speaking communities to their south, Mohican villages followed a dispersed settlement pattern, with each community likely dominated by a single lineage or clan. The villages usually consisted of a small cluster of small and mid-sized longhouses, and were located along floodplains. During times of war, they built fortifications in defensive locations (such as along ridges) as places of retreat. Their cornfields were located near their communities; the women also cultivated varieties of squash, beans, sunflowers, and other crops from the Eastern Agricultural Complex. Horticulture and the gathering and processing of nuts (hickory, butternuts, black walnuts and acorns), fruits (blueberries, raspberries, juneberries among many others), and roots (groundnuts, wood lilies, arrowroot among others) provided much of their diet. This was supplemented by the men hunting game (turkeys, deer, elk, bears, and moose in the Taconics) and fishing (sturgeon, alewives, shad, eels, lamprey and striped bass).Language The now extinct Mohican language belonged to the Eastern Algonquian branch of the Algonquian language family.HistoryMohican Confederacy The Mohican were a confederacy of five tribes and as many as forty villages.Mohican proper, lived in the vicinity of today's Albany (, 'the fireplace of the Mahican Nation') west towards the Mohawk River and to the northwest to Lake Champlain and Lake George, lived along the west shore of the Hudson River above the Catskill Creek Wawyachtonoc (or ,'eddy people' or 'people of the curving channel'), lived in Dutchess County and Columbia County eastward to the Housatonic River in Litchfield County, Connecticut, main village was Weantinock, additional villages: Shecomeco, Wechquadnach, Pamperaug, Bantam, Weataug, ScaticookWestenhuck (from , 'on the other side of the mountains'), the name of a village near Great Barrington, Massachusetts. Often called the 'Housatonic people', they lived in the Housatonic Valley in Connecticut and Massachusetts and in the vicinity of Great Barrington, which they called , meaning 'the place downstream'Wiekagjoc (from , 'upper reaches of a river'), lived east of the Hudson Rivers near the city of Hudson, Columbia County, New YorkConflict with the MohawkThe Algonquians (Mohican) and Iroquois (Mohawk) were traditional competitors and enemies. Iroquois oral tradition, as recorded in the Jesuit Relations, speaks of a war between the Mohawks and an alliance of the Susquehannock and Algonquin (sometime between 1580 and 1600). This was perhaps in response to the formation of the League of the Iroquois.In September 1609 Henry Hudson encountered Mohican villages just below present day Albany, with whom he traded goods for furs. Hudson returned to Holland with a cargo of valuable furs which immediately attracted Dutch merchants to the area. The first Dutch fur traders arrived on the Hudson River the following year to trade with the Mohicans. Besides exposing them to European epidemics, the fur trade destabilized the region.In 1614, the Dutch decided to establish a permanent trading post on Castle Island, on the site of a previous French post that had been long abandoned; but first they had to arrange a truce to end fighting which had broken out between the Mohicans and Mohawks. Fighting broke out again between the Mohicans and Mohawks in 1617, and with Fort Nassau badly damaged by a freshet, the Dutch abandoned the fort. In 1618, having once again negotiated a truce, the Dutch rebuilt Fort Nassau on higher ground. Late that year, Fort Nassau was destroyed by flooding and abandoned for good. In 1624, Captain Cornelius Jacobsen May sailed theupriver and landed eighteen families of Walloons on a plain opposite Castle Island. They commenced to construct Fort Orange.The Mohicans invited the Algonquin and Montagnais to bring their furs to Fort Orange as an alternate to French traders in Quebec. Seeing the Mohicans extended their control over the fur trade, the Mohawk attacked, with initial success. In 1625 or 1626 the Mohicans destroyed the easternmost Iroquois 'castle'. The Mohawks then re-located south of the Mohawk River, closer to Fort Orange. In July 1626 many of the settlers moved to New Amsterdam because of the conflict. The Mohicans requested help from the Dutch and Commander Daniel Van Krieckebeek set out from the fort with six soldiers. Van Krieckebeek, three soldiers, and twenty-four Mohicans were killed when their party was ambushed by the Mohawk about a mile from the fort. The Mohawks withdrew with some body parts of those slain for later consumption as a demonstration of supremacy.War continued to rage between the Mohicans and Mohawks throughout the area from Skahnéhtati (Schenectady) to Kinderhoek Kinderhook. By 1629, the Mohawks had taken over territories on the west bank of the Hudson River that were formerly held by the Mohicans. The conflict caused most of the Mohican to migrate eastward across the Hudson River into western Massachusetts and Connecticut.The Mohawks gained a near-monopoly in the fur trade with the Dutch by prohibiting the nearby Algonquian-speaking tribes to the north or east to trade.Stockbridge Many Mohicans settled in the town of Stockbridge, Massachusetts, where they gradually became known as the 'Stockbridge Indians'. , one of their chiefs, accompanied three Mohawk chiefs on a state visit to Queen Anne and her government in England in 1710. They were popularly referred to as the Four Mohawk Kings.The Stockbridge Indians allowed Protestant missionaries, including Jonathan Edwards, to live among them.In the 18th century, many converted to Christianity, while keeping certain traditions of their own.They fought on the side of the British colonists in the French and Indian War (also known as the Seven Years' War).During the American Revolution, they sided with the colonists.In the eighteenth century, some of the Mohicans developed strong ties with missionaries of the Moravian Church from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, who founded a mission at their village ofin Dutchess County, New York. Henry Rauch reached out to two Mohican leaders, , also known as ; and , who took him back to Shekomeko. They named him the new religious teacher. Over time, Rauch won listeners, as the Mohicans had suffered much from disease and warfare, which had disrupted their society. Early in 1742, Shabash and two other Mohicans accompanied Rauch to Bethlehem, where he was to be ordained as a deacon. The three Mohicans were baptized on 11 February 1742 in John de Turk's barn nearby at Oley, Pennsylvania. Shabash was the first Mohican of Shekomeko to adopt the Christian religion. The Moravians built a chapel for the Mohican people in 1743. They defended the Mohican against European colonists' exploitation, trying to protect them against land encroachment and abuses of liquor.On a 1738 visit to New York, the Mohicans spoke to Governor Lewis Morris concerning the sale of their land near Shekomeko. The Governor promised they would be paid as soon as the lands were surveyed.He suggested that for their own security, they should mark off their square mile of land they wished to keep, which the Mohicans never did. In September 1743, still under the Acting-Governor George Clarke the land was finally surveyed by New York Assembly agents and divided into lots, a row of which ran through the Indians' reserved land. With some help from the missionaries, on 17 October 1743 and already under the new Royal Governor George Clinton, Shabash put together a petition of names of people who could attest that the land in which one of the lots was running through was theirs. Despite Shabash's appeals, his persistence, and the missionaries' help, the Mohicans lost the case. The lots were eventually bought up by European-American colonists and the Mohicans were forced out of Shekomeko. Some who opposed the missionaries' work accused them of being secret Catholic Jesuits (who had been outlawed from the colony in 1700) and of working with the Mohicans on the side of the French. The missionaries were summoned more than once before colonial government, but also had supporters. In the late 1740s the colonial government at Poughkeepsie expelled the missionaries from New York, in part because of their advocacy of Mohican rights. European colonists soon took over the Mohican land.Revolutionary WarIn August 1775, the Six Nations staged a council fire near Albany, after news of Bunker Hill had made war seem imminent. After much debate, they decided that such a war was a private affair between the British and the colonists (known as Rebels, Revolutionaries, Congress-Men, American Whigs, or Patriots), and that they should stay out of it. Mohawk Chief Joseph Brant feared that the Indians would lose their lands if the Colonists achieved independence. Sir William Johnson, his son John Johnson and son-in-law Guy Johnson and Brant used all their influence to engage the Iroquois to fight for the British cause. The Mohawk, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca ultimately became allies and provided warriors for the battles in the New York area. The Oneida and Tuscarora sided with the Colonists. The Mohicans, who as Algonquians were not part of the Iroquois Confederacy, sided with the Patriots, serving at the Siege of Boston, and the battles of Saratoga and Monmouth.In 1778 they lost forty warriors of their Stockbridge Militia, around half 'Stockbridge Indians' who were remnants of both Mohican and Wappinger tribes, in a British attack on the land of the van Cortlandt family. (In 1888, the property became Van Courtland Park in the Bronx, New York.) The Battle of Kingsbridge decimated the troop's ranks.It received a commendation from George Washington, was paid 1,000 and dismissed.Move to Oneida, New York After the Revolution the citizens of the new United States forced many Native Americans off their land and westward. In the 1780s, groups of Stockbridge Indians, today regarded as Stockbridge Munsee, moved from Massachusetts to a new location among the Oneida people in central New York, who had been granted areservation for their service to the Patriots, out of their former territory of . They called their settlement New Stockbridge. Some individuals and families, mostly people who were old or those with special ties to the area, remained behind at Stockbridge.The central figures of Mohican society, including the chief sachem, Joseph Quanaukaunt, and his counselors and relatives, were part of the move to New Stockbridge. At the new town, the Stockbridge emigrants controlled their own affairs and combined traditional ways with the new as they chose. After learning from the Christian missionaries, the Stockbridge Indians were experienced in English ways. At New Stockbridge they replicated their former town. While continuing as Christians, they retained their language and Mohican cultural traditions. In general, their evolving Mohican identity was still rooted in traditions of the past.Removal to Wisconsin In the 1820s and 1830s, most of the Stockbridge Indians moved to Shawano County, Wisconsin, where they were promised land by the US government under the policy of Indian removal. In Wisconsin, they settled on reservations with the Lenape (called Munsee after one of their major dialects), who were also speakers of one of the Algonquian languages.Together, the two formed a band and are federally recognized as the Stockbridge-Munsee Community.Their 22,000-acre reservation is known as that of the Stockbridge-Munsee Band of Mohican Indians and is located near the town of Bowler. Since the late twentieth century, they have developed the North Star Mohican Resort and Casino on their reservation, which has successfully generated funds for tribal welfare and economic development.Land claims In the late twentieth century, the Stockbridge-Munsee were among tribes filing land claims against New York, which had been ruled to have unconstitutionally acquired land from Indians without Senate ratification. The Stockbridge-Munsee filed a land claim against New York state forin Madison County, the location of its former property. In 2011, outgoing governor David Paterson announced having reached a deal with the tribe. They would be given nearlyin Madison County and give up their larger claim in exchange for the state's giving them 330 acres of land in Sullivan County in the Catskill Mountains, where the government was trying to encourage economic development. The federal government had agreed to take the land in trust, making it eligible for development as a gaming casino, and the state would allow gaming, an increasingly important source of revenue for American Indians. Race track and casinos, private interests and other tribes opposed the deal.In 2011, the Stockbridge-Munsee Community Band of the Mohican Indians regained ownership 156 acres along the Hudson River, a tract known as Papscanee Island Nature Preserve near East Greenbush and Schodack. The land was donated to descendants of its indigenous inhabitants by the Open Space Initiative. Prior to colonization, the island was used for ceremonies by the Mohicans before it was acquired by Dutch merchant Kiliaen Van Rensselaer in 1637. The property is managed by Rensselaer County and the Rensselaer Land Trust for public access and protection, while owned by the Mohicans.Representation in media James Fenimore Cooper based his novel, The Last of the Mohicans, on the Mohican tribe. His description includes some cultural aspects of the Mohegan, a different Algonquian tribe that lived in eastern Connecticut. Cooper set his novel in the Hudson Valley, Mohican land, but used some Mohegan names for his characters, such as Uncas.The novel has been adapted for the cinema more than a dozen times, the first time in 1920. Michael Mann directed a 1992 adaptation, which starred Daniel Day-Lewis as a Mohican-adopted white man.Notable membersEtow Oh Koam, Mohican sachem and one of the Four Indian Kings, who, with three Mohawk leaders, made a state visit to Queen Anne and her government in England in 1710.Hendrick Aupaumut, (1757–1830) sachem, historian, and American Revolutionary War captainSteve Conliff, (1949-2006) political writer, historian, Yippie activistBrent Michael Davids, (b. 1959) composer/flautistBill Miller, (b. 1955) musicianElecta Quinney, (1798–1885) first public teacher and school mistress in WisconsinJohn Wannuaucon Quinney, (1797–1855) diplomatDon Coyhis (born August 16, 1943), addiction specialist, Native American health activist and author.See alsoNative American tribes in MassachusettsReferencesBibliographyAupaumut, Hendrick.

They are a subgroup of the Munsee branch of the Algonquin and are members of the Iroquois. The word “Mohican” was a term used by colonists to falsely refer to the tribe. It is said to be derived from a mischoice of the tribe’s traditional self-ascription Mahikander, which translates to “the people of the great river” as they originated in areas adjacent to the Hudson river. Mohicans historically spoke the Munsee dialect of Algonquian language. Through European colonization and contact, the Mohican descended into poverty and dispersed around the United States and Canada. By the late 19th century, most of their language and customs were gone due to assimilation. Due to their move of location, the Mohicans have many similarities with their Munsee and Lenape counterparts. Historically, the typically semi-nomadic tribes had villages of longhouses which were clustered around the area of the Hudson Valley, stretching from present-day New York to Berkshire County, Massachusetts. As well as these, other villages were known to have been built in Vermont and southern New Hampshire. Culturally, the Algonquian-speaking Mohicans largely based their beliefs around nature and their environment, paying homage to their doctrines in the woods and rivers, thus creating a spiritual bond between both. Traditionally, they were known to have hunting and fishing rituals, using apparel and weapons made from materials such as stone, flint, and animal pelts. The iconic image of the Mohican is heavily linked to the colonial novel Last of the Mohicans written by James Fenimore Cooper in 1826. The novel, which has been adapted into a film and a miniseries, has helped gave the tribe a type of celebrity status and appreciation, particularly in the United States. Moreover, the Mohicans have since began to heavily reconverge in the state of Wisconsin. The Mohican Nation of Wisconsin Federal Court decision in 1994 established the tribe's political autonomy, allowing them to set up tribally-owned lands, implement their own laws and guidelines, and self-identify as Native Americans. In modern day, the Mohican are still recognized as a Federally-recognized tribe, having maintained their status as citizens throughout many major changes in American history. Today, the Mohicans are celebrated as a cultural group, being known for their advocacy of environmental causes, their participation in pow-wows and other ceremonies, and preserving the culture and language of their ancestors for future generations.

The player starts with small steam trains of limited fuel and speed that can carry a small amount of cargo, and/or passenger cars. Earning coins from delivering jobs, the player slowly expands their rail network to include more cities and better trains. Like Pocket Planes, Pocket Trains uses real cities around the world and has quasi-realistic costs to purchase tracks and cities relative to the real world.'Jobs' are single delivery tasks offered to trains. They are priced based on the distance from the originating station to the destination. Although multiple jobs may be headed to the same destination, different types of jobs may be more profitable than others. Jobs can be held at stations for transfer between trains or for later transport.Certain jobs involve the delivery of 'Crates', which are placed into the player's inventory upon delivery. Crates can be opened using the second currency 'Bux' and contain parts for trains that can be built once all the necessary components are achieved.There are also special jobs that earn the player a secondary in-game currency called 'Bux'. This currency can be used to buy coins, allow more jobs to be held in yards at stations, speed up trains, and open crates. Bux can also be purchased with money.Crates, Coins and Bux can also be received by watching the train travel screen, and tapping on the resources as they pass by.ReceptionPocket Trains has been received well by critics. Metacritic described it as a 'fun ride', giving it an aggregated score of 76/100. Toucharcade rated it 4.5 out of 5 stars, saying it was 'yet another fun title' when comparing it to Pocket Planes. Gamezebo also rated it 4.5/5 stating it was a 'charming, highly addictive' game. Pocket Gamer rated it 7/10, calling it an 'impressively simple time-waster', but noting that it 'is a little too similar to its airborne predecessor', referring to Pocket Planes.

It was built in 1615 by Sofi Sinan Pasha, bey of Budim. The mosque overlooks the main street of Prizren and is a dominant feature in the town's skyline.Sinan Pasha Mosque was declared a Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance in 1990 by the Republic of Serbia.HistorySofi Sinan Pasha started construction of the mosque in either 1600 or 1608. Sofi Sinan Pasha, an Albanian and former beylerbey and kaymakam in Bosnia should not be confused with grand vizier Sinan Pasha, who built the Sinan Pasha Mosque in the nearby city of Kačanik.It is widely considered that the stones used to build the mosque were taken from nearby Saint Archangels Monastery, a Serbian Orthodox monastery founded by Serbian Emperor Stefan Dušan. In fact, parts of the former monastery can be seen in the mosque. The monastery, which was abandoned after the arrival of the Ottomans in the 16th century, had fallen to ruins by the 17th century. Hasan Kaleshi, an Albanian historian, sustained in 1972 that Sofi Sinan Pasha couldn't have possibly ordered any monastery destruction as this was impossible without a Sultan decree, rather, he ordered the use of the spare stones to a better deed as ordered by the Sultan.DescriptionThe mosque covers roughlybyand is square in shape. It has one large dome and another smaller half-dome that covers the mihrab, which is painted and has a stalactite hood. The mosque's walls arethick and its minaret, which is topped by a conical structure covered by lead, isin height.The walls and dome inside Sinan Pasha Mosque were painted in the 19th century, mostly of floral patterns and Qur'an verses. The minbar is painted with floral motives. Both the large dome and the half-dome of the mosque are covered with lead. The stone flooring of the mosque and the carpentry are original.Preservation concernsRain, which over time has entered the mosque via holes in the roof, has caused the loss of some original paintings on the walls and has led to the detachment of some of the wall plaster. Stones of the façade have faced weathering.Abdullah Gërguri worked on a series of repairs of the murals, particularly in the 1970s.In early 2000 the cost to rehabilitate the building was estimated at about €500,000 by UNESCO.Manuscripts and use of building controversyThe Prizren municipality intended to build a library within the mosque in order to preserve not only the original Ottoman manuscripts found in the mosque, but also other valuable ones that can be found all over Kosovo. However, the Islamic Union of Kosovo filed a lawsuit against the Prizren Municipality in order to not allow the mosque to become a museum, but instead to have it continue to be a religious building.See alsoList of mosques in KosovoNotesReferencesMosques in Prizren Ottoman mosques in Kosovo Religious buildings and structures completed in 1615 1615 establishments in the Ottoman Empire 17th-century mosques Cultural Monuments of Exceptional Importance (Serbia) Monuments and memorials in Kosovo", "machine_text": " The Sinan Pasha Mosque (also known as the Ćarshija Mosque) is an Ottoman mosque located in the city of Prizren, Kosovo. It is one of the largest and most impressive monuments constructed during the period of Ottoman rule in Kosovo. The mosque is named after Sinan Pasha, the 5th Ottoman governor of Kosovo, who ordered its construction in 1615. The mosque was built entirely out of stone, with a rectangular structure measuring 37 m by 25 m, and two tall minarets. The main prayer hall is covered by a large dome, and flanked by two half-domes with barrel vaults. Inside the prayer hall, the walls and the domes are decorated with frescoes painted in the traditional Islamic style, as well as with geometric and floral motifs in blue and gold. Additionally, the facade of the mosque is decorated with calligraphic inscriptions which call for prayer, while the interior walls contain inscriptions describing the life of Sinan Pasha and his achievements. The mosque is located in the Prizren old town, in the bazaar Ćarshija, where Sinan Pasha built his own mansion and his own fountain. The bazaar and the fountain are still in place and regularly visited by tourists. The mosque also contains the mausoleum of Sinan Pasha and his family. The Sinan Pasha Mosque was, and still is, of great importance as a reflection of traditional Islamic life in the Balkans. It is also an important symbol of unity of the two branches of Islam, Sunni and Shia, represented by the many varieties of calligraphy in the mosque. In 1997, the Sinan Pasha Mosque became a venue for peace talks between the leaders of the local Albanian population and representatives from NATO. The mosque and the bazaar gained the status of a national monument in 2008, and has been listed as a UNESCO world heritage site since 2006.

The magazine was launched in 1980 by ex-Record Mirror journalists Barry Cain and Tim Lott. One of the most notable issues was the February 1981 disc featuring Adam and the Ants performing a version of the Village People hit 'Y.M.C.A.', called 'A.N.T.S.'. Flexipop's last released flexidisc was 'In The Mix' by Haysi Fantayzee in 1983.The magazine has maintained a memorable reputation among music collectors because of the flexidisc and the revival of interest in 1980s pop.Huw Collingbourne, a contributing writer to Flexipop, gave an interview to Stylus magazine about the publication in which he said, 'Other music mags may have dabbled in flexis, but Flexipop! made a career of it.

It was launched in 1979 by Twist and Shout Publishing as an alternative to the more established music magazines of the time such as Smash Hits and recorded a circulation of more than 50,000. The magazine was mainly aimed at the youth market, with the magazine's slogan being 'Flexipop: the music magazine that's fun'. The magazine primarily covered the emerging new wave music scene and was known for its colourful, zany and irreverent content, which was mainly aimed at a teenage audience. Flexipop, unlike other music magazines, often made it a priority to be a leader in introducing new bands, as well as publishing interviews and reviews of music from both the UK and abroad. The magazine also featured a range of memorabilia and collectable items, adding to its popularity with music fans. Flexipop had a unique approach to its layout, making use of comic strip-like featurettes and pages that Jumped around and changed size in order to give visual interest. Flexipop was also one of the first music magazines to make use of computer-generated imagery and graphics to supplement its brightly coloured pages. Flexipop had an often eccentric range of covers, featuring celebrities such as Blondie, Boy George and Supertramp, and the magazine often featured an innovative mixture of interviews, reviews, photoshoots, competitions and features. The magazine spawned a series of Flexipop related compilation albums of both new and established acts. During its time, Flexipop received both acclaim and some criticism for its tongue-in-cheek humour, and its often obscure coverage. It eventually folded due to low sales in 1985. The next year, the magazine was replaced by a different publication, Rock and Roll Monthly, but it failed to attract the same level of popularity as Flexipop. Although Flexipop is no longer in print, it is fondly remembered by music fans and those who were part of the magazine's short life. The magazine has been cited by some as having helped to shape and influence the British music scene during the 1980s, and its influence can still be recognised in various publications today.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 13099381}

The Commission issued its final report in January 2015. It highlighted the need to invest in the social sciences and humanities, in particular to help build a more just and equitable society, enhance our ability to recognize and understand human diversity, and expand economic opportunity. It went on to note the need to promote partnerships between the public, private, and non-profit sectors to support the development of programs and initiatives that advance the social sciences and humanities at all levels. The Commission's recommendations were divided into three major areas: Strengthening the Infrastructure, Enhancing Research and Scholarship, and Engaging Students and the Public. The report also outlined several proposed strategies to advance the mission of the humanities and social sciences, such as providing targeted funding for research and educational programs, investing in professional development for faculty and students, and creating innovative initiatives to engage the public in the humanities and social sciences. In addition, the report provided recommendations for specific federal policy changes and new resources that could be devoted to these fields.

After studying in Paris and Italy, he entered Harvard College and graduated in 1839. Channing was ordained, and accepted a Unitarian pastor’s call to the Hollis Street Church in Boston in 1842, where he became known for his 'radical' teachings. He was dismissed from the Hollis Street Church in 1855, and he became a professor of church history at Harvard Divinity School from 1856–1884. In addition to his teaching and preaching activities, Channing was also deeply involved in the Unitarian movement. He attended the American Unitarian Association’s national convention annually, and served as its corresponding secretary from 1855–1869. He attended its annual meeting from 1867–1881, and during those years was involved in several important Unitarian activities, including: promoting a union between Unitarians and Unitarian Universalists; the unity of the American Unitarian Association and the Free Religious Association; helping found Tufts University; and, assisting in the production of several volumes of Hymns of the Soul. As a theologian and historian, his writings were widely read and respected. He wrote numerous works, among them History of Unitarianism (1852) and History of Rationalism (1862).

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Megaupload legal case\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Megaupload legal case concerns a number of related criminal indictments and enforcement actions taken against Megaupload owner Kim Dotcom in various jurisdictions. On 19 January 2012 the United States Department of Justice seized and shut down the file-hosting site Megaupload.com and commenced criminal cases against its owners and others. On 20 January 2012 Hong Kong Customs froze more than 300 million Hong Kong dollars (US39 million) in assets belonging to the company.Arrests in New Zealand Acting upon a US Federal prosecutor's request, the New Zealand Police arrested Dotcom and three other Megaupload executives in a leased30 million mansion at Coatesville near Auckland on Friday, 20 January 2012 (NZDT, UTC+13). This was pursuant to a request from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation that the four be extradited for racketeering and money laundering. The raid was timed for the birthday celebration of Dotcom. Assets worth 17 million including art works and cars were seized. The four men arrested were Kim Dotcom (founder; 38 years old, from Germany), Finn Batato (Chief marketing officer (CMO); 38, from Germany), Mathias Ortmann (Chief technology officer (CTO) and co-founder; 40, from Germany) and Bram van der Kolk (29, from the Netherlands). The number of police officers involved in this operation was about 80 according to Dotcom or 20 to 30 according to the New Zealand police.On 23 January, Dotcom appeared in Auckland's North Shore District Court for a bail hearing. The crown argued against bail on the basis that he was a flight risk with a helicopter on his front lawn, while defence lawyers argued that the helicopter could not fly far enough to reach another country. They also said that Dotcom denied any criminal wrongdoing. Judge David McNaughton expressed concern at the discovery of two shotguns at Dotcom's mansion during the police raid, and deferred a decision on whether to grant bail, saying that he needed more time to review the submissions. The request for bail was turned down, with Judge McNaughton saying that 'he was denied due to the risk [that] Mr. Dotcom would flee jurisdiction and the possibility that if he reached Germany he wouldn't be extradited to face the charges'. On 3 February 2012, an appeal to the High Court of New Zealand upheld the decision to deny bail.On 22 February 2012, North Shore District Court Judge Nevin Dawson overturned the previous rulings and granted bail to Kim Dotcom, saying that the risk of flight had diminished after his assets had been seized.On 5 March 2012, a formal request for the extradition to the United States of Kim Dotcom and three other senior Megaupload staff was filed in a New Zealand court.On 30 April 2012, the New Zealand High Court ruled that around750,000 of Kim Dotcom's assets could be returned, including a Mercedes-Benz G55 AMG and Toyota Vellfire that had been seized during the raid on his home. The assets in 63 bank accounts and around thirty other vehicles remained in custody. A paperwork error by the New Zealand authorities meant that Kim Dotcom's property had been seized in January 2012 without giving proper notice. The restraining order on his property was granted in April 2012. During April 2012, US district court judge Liam O'Grady stated 'I frankly don't know that we are ever going to have a trial in this matter,' as he found out that the company had never been formally served with criminal papers by the US.On 28 June 2012, New Zealand High Court justice Helen Winkelmann ruled that the search warrants used to raid the home of Kim Dotcom were invalid, saying 'The warrants did not adequately describe the offences to which they related. They were general warrants, and as such, are invalid.'On 10 July 2012, a decision on whether Kim Dotcom and other Megaupload employees should be extradited to the United States was delayed until March 2013, in order to allow further time for legal arguments to be heard. In December 2012, it was delayed until August 2013.In March 2013, Dotcom won a Court of Appeal ruling allowing him to sue the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB), rejecting the attorney-general's appeal against a ruling in December, 2012.On 19 February 2014, a New Zealand appeals court overruled the 28 June 2012 decision, declaring the search warrants against Kim Dotcom to be valid. Dotcom's extradition hearing was set for July 2014.On 8 September 2014, the Court of Appeal ruled that the New Zealand Police is to return seized electronic devices unencrypted back to Dotcom and those involved.Basis of indictmentThe indictment alleged that Megaupload differed from other online file storage businesses.Media reports covering the case highlighted a number of points from the indictment used to support claims of illegal activity. The indictment provided a number of instances alleged to show criminal behaviour, as well as indicating design points of Megaupload's operating model as being evidence of criminal intent:In practice, the 'vast majority' of users do not have any significant long term private storage capability. Continued storage is dependent upon regular downloads of the file occurring. Files not downloaded are rapidly removed in most cases, whereas popular downloaded files are retained. (items 7 – 8)Because only a small portion of users pay for storage, the business is dependent upon advertising. Adverts are primarily viewed when files are downloaded and the business model is therefore not based upon storage but upon maximising downloads. (items 7 – 8)Persons indicted have 'instructed individual users how to locate links to infringing content on the Mega Sites ... [and] ... have also shared with each other comments from Mega Site users demonstrating that they have used or are attempting to use the Mega Sites to get infringing copies of copyrighted content.' (item 13)Persons indicted, unlike the public, are not reliant upon links to stored files, but can search the internal database directly. It is claimed they have 'searched the internal database for their associates and themselves so that they may directly access copyright-infringing content'. (item 14)A comprehensive takedown method is in use to identify child pornography, but not deployed to remove infringing content. (item 24)Infringing users did not have their accounts terminated, and the defendants 'made no significant effort to identify users who were using the Mega Sites or services to infringe copyrights, to prevent the uploading of infringing copies of copyrighted materials, or to identify infringing copies of copyrighted works' (item 55–56)An incentivising program was adopted encouraging the upload of 'popular' files in return for payments to successful uploaders. (item 69e et al.)Defendants explicitly discussed evasion and infringement issues, including an attempt to copy and upload the entire content of YouTube. (items 69i-l. YouTube: items 69 i,j,l,s)Counter arguments advancedSchmitz hired the services of Ira Rothken, an attorney who defended several copyright infringement cases. Rothken claims that the raid was unjustly swift and did not give his client the opportunity to defend himself, quoting a similar case involving YouTube as an example of a completely different turnout.Legal commentators point out that while the indictment may be correct and Megaupload might have acted as a criminal conspiracy as claimed, a number of points in the indictment are based upon selective interpretations and legal concepts (described in one article as 'novel theories' of the law) and could be challenged in court. An L.A. Times analysis stated that the author was 'struck by how far the indictment goes to find something nefarious'; likewise a TechDirt analysis concluded that while the founder of Megaupload had a significant history of 'flaunting the law', evidence has potentially been taken out of context or misrepresented and could 'come back to haunt other online services who are providing perfectly legitimate services'. Both analyses concur that other evidence could show criminality; the concerns were not irrefutable. The legal concerns included:Indictment cites lack of a site search as evidence supporting criminality, but in other copyright cases having a site search has been described as evidence in support of criminality and in Atari v. RapidShare not having a site search was agreed by the court as evidence of responsible activity given that some infringing content might exist and be searched for if one existed. In the case of Isohunt, the presence of a search feature was interpreted as evidence of inducement. TechDirt commented that 'To use the lack of a feature, that previously was shown to be a problem, as evidence of a conspiracy is crazy. Damned if you do, damned if you don't.'The 'top 100' list excluded copyrighted titles, but the indictment claims this was evidence of concealing, rather than avoiding downloads of, infringing materials.The indictment asserts as evidence that no effort was made to identify infringing files or users, in other words by acts of omission. But federal court rulings repeatedly agree that no duty exists to search these out. In particular, in MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd. the Supreme Court looked at 'substantial noninfringing uses'; mere lack of monitoring was not by itself sufficient to show wrongdoing or inducement. It may not be possible (or reasonable to require) the host to know and identify what activity is legitimate or not, as file sharing may be used by many content creators.Deletion after a limited period of non-download is suggested as evidence of a motive. But many legitimate sites such as Imgur remove unused content after a while to free up server space. If files were routinely deleted after a short period it could equally suggest legitimate use - because it serves users who share legitimately for a short while, and enforces removal afterwards.Much of the indictment, in the words of one analysis, 'seems to be based on the simple assumption that encouraging more usage means they must be encouraging infringement', in other words there should be evidence of actual wrongdoing, not merely evidence of popular use. Many legitimate files are popular and popularly shared, and an assumption that paid use largely equates to infringing use would need evidence.Failure to remove all links following a takedown request is often legitimate. For example the same content may be uploaded by legitimate and illegitimate users. Removing the infringing link does not affect legitimate uploaders. Removing the infringing file would wrongfully cause it to be deleted for legitimate users too. Similarly, once child pornography is identified, it is always illegal for all users. But other material may be legal for some users and not for others. So the fact one case requires file removal and the other only requires link removal may well be correct conduct.The indictment includes money laundering charges. But these include 'basic payments' for web hosting, suggesting 'lumping in' — adding matters that are in no way illegal to make a case look bad.Megaupload had indicated willingness to attend court in the U.S. already, and answer civil cases.Safe harbor provisions The US Digital Millennium Copyright Act provides safe harbor for sites that promptly take down infringing content. Safe harbor does not exist if the site has actual knowledge and does nothing about it.In Megaupload's case, the indictment alleges DMCA provisions were used for the appearance of legitimacy – the actual material was not removed, only some links to it were, takedowns agreement was approved based on business growth rather than infringement, and the parties themselves openly discussed their infringing activities. The indictment claims that Megaupload executives:... are willfully infringing copyrights themselves on these systems; have actual knowledge that the materials on their systems are infringing (or alternatively know facts or circumstances that would make infringing material apparent); receive a financial benefit directly attributable to copyright-infringing activity where the provider can control that activity; and have not removed, or disabled access to, known copyright infringing material from servers they control.Prosecutors claimed in the indictment that Megaupload was not DMCA compliant, and cited the example of an alleged infringer on the site known as 'VV.' Over six years, VV had allegedly uploaded nearly 17,000 files to Megavideo.com, resulting in more than 334 million views. According to prosecutors, although numerous takedown e-mails had been sent, none of the files had been deleted.In a television interview with 3 News, Kim Dotcom denied being a 'piracy king', and claimed that Megaupload had applied the provisions of the DMCA and went beyond it, by giving copyright holders direct rights to delete links. He also claimed that the indictment relied on a malicious interpretation of technical issues to construe its claim of criminal intent, and that there was significant legal use of Megaupload.Criminal defense action Kim Dotcom denied the charges filed against him, and retained the services of Ira P. Rothken, an attorney who has defended several copyright infringement cases. Ira Rothken stated that there is no criminal liability for secondary copyright infringement under US law, quoting a similar case involving YouTube as an example of similar accusations which were dealt with as a civil case.Dotcom initially hired Washington, D.C. attorney Robert Bennett, who had confirmed that he was going to represent Megaupload in the piracy case. On 22 January 2012, Bennett withdrew from the case due to a conflict of interest with another client. As of 23 January, barrister Paul Davison QC was quoted as representing Megaupload's founder, Kim Dotcom, in New Zealand. At the end of April 2012, a controversy emerged over legal representation. The law firm Quinn Emanuel, retained by Megaupload to argue for the retention of Megaupload's data, claimed in a motion filed to the court that there was a concerted effort by the United States Department of Justice to deny Megaupload fair legal representation. In the brief, Quinn Emanuel alleged that several law firms had dropped out of the case after the DoJ wrote to them over potential conflicts of interest, arguing that they wanted to call clients of the firms as witnesses. Given the size of the Megaupload, Quinn Emanuel claimed that this 'conflict of interest' argument could be applied to any law firm with experience in intellectual property rights, denying Megaupload experienced representation in a case where both law and technical issues are involved. Quinn Emanuel received such a letter but rejected the DoJ's arguments.Techdirt argued that while the founder of Megaupload had a significant history of 'flouting the law', evidence had potentially been taken out of context or misrepresented and could 'come back to haunt other online services who are providing perfectly legitimate services'. Eric Goldman, a professor of law at Santa Clara University, described the Megaupload case as 'a depressing display of abuse of government authority'. He pointed out that criminal copyright infringement requires that willful infringement has taken place, and that taking Megaupload offline had produced the 'deeply unconstitutional effect' of denying legitimate users of the site access to their data. Other legal commentators have disagreed with Goldman's assessment of the copyright charges, concluding that the allegations in the indictment, if proven, would support a guilty finding on charges of aiding and abetting copyright infringement. Professor James Grimmelmann, for example, commented, 'If proven at trial, there's easily enough in the indictment to prove criminal copyright infringement many times over.'The defense has drawn on procedural errors by the prosecution to challenge the case. In a judgement in the end of May, NZ Judge David Harvey granted the defendants the right to the disclosure of evidence against them held by the FBI in preparation for the extradition trial. In his 81-page decision, he came to the assessment that the DoJ is attempting to use concepts of civil law, in particular secondary copyright infringement, in a criminal case, which creates legal issues. He also confirmed that the charges in the indictment relating to money laundering, racketeering and wire fraud are not separate criminal acts but dependent on the claim of criminal secondary copyright infringement. In a separate development in the United States, the defense has challenged the case against Megaupload as a whole, claiming that the US has no jurisdiction over a foreign company and that the seizure of Megaupload's assets was unlawful. A second brief points out numerous legal errors in the indictment, declaring it 'an experiment in stretching U.S. criminal law well past the breaking point.'Data retention Following the seizure of Megaupload, concerns were raised as to what would happen to the files that had been uploaded by its users. On 20 January 2012, the Justice Department stated that 'It is important to note that Mega clearly warned users to keep copies of any files they uploaded' adding that 'Megaupload.com expressly informed users through its Frequently Asked Questions ('FAQs') and its Terms of Service that users have no proprietary interest in any of the files on Megaupload's servers, they assume the full risk of complete loss or unavailability of their data, and that Megaupload can terminate site operations without prior notice.' On 27 January 2012, U.S. Attorney Neil H. MacBride wrote:The Mega Servers are not in the actual or constructive custody or control of the United States, but remain at the premises controlled by, and currently under the control of, Carpathia and Cogent. Should the defendants wish to obtain independent access to the Mega Servers, or coordinate third-party access to data housed on Mega Servers, the issue must be resolved directly with Cogent or Carpathia.In response, on 30 January 2012, Carpathia Hosting denied having access to MegaUpload files and issued a press release statingCarpathia Hosting does not have, and has never had, access to the content on MegaUpload servers and has no mechanism for returning any content residing on such servers to MegaUpload's customers. The reference to the 2 February 2012 date in the Department of Justice letter for the deletion of content is not based on any information provided by Carpathia to the U.S. Government. We would recommend that anyone who believes that they have content on MegaUpload servers contact MegaUpload. Please do not contact Carpathia Hosting.The Electronic Frontier Foundation has started a campaign to allow legitimate users of Megaupload in the US access to their data and wants the data preserved for that reason. It has chosen to represent one such legitimate user in court and thus has sided with Megaupload and Carpathia in asking the court to retain the data.On 26 April 2012, Megaupload data negotiations began. Carpathia reported that maintaining the data costs over US9,000 a day, and wanted to seek a formal resolution on whether to delete the data or release it to interested parties. United States district court Judge Liam O'Grady ordered all parties to return to the negotiating table. The U.S. Department of Justice noted that US35 million had been paid by Megaupload to Carpathia, and alleged that Carpathia had knowingly profited from copyright infringement.Retaliatory attacks by Anonymous Following the shutdown of the Megaupload website, the website of the United States Department of Justice and a number of other websites were taken offline following concerted denial of service attacks attributed to Anonymous.Gizmodo concurred that it was 'almost certainly the result of a quickly assembled DDoS [Distributed Denial of Service] attack—and easily the widest in scope and ferocity we've seen in some time', commenting that 'if you had any doubts Anonymous is still a hacker wrecking ball, doubt no more'. Links posted in chatrooms and on Twitter, when clicked on by unsuspecting Internet users, ran a web version of the application known as the Low Orbit Ion Cannon. On 19 January 2012, Anonymous released a statement on Pastebin.com accepting responsibility of the mass attacks on websites including those of RIAA, MPAA, BMI, FBI, and others. According to the Russian state-run RT network, Anonymous described the attacks as 'the single largest Internet attack in its history'.Other reactions Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy said he was satisfied with the shutdown of the website. He found the site's operators were reaping 'criminal profits from the illegal distribution of copyrighted works'. 'The time has come for increased judicial and police co-operation between states' in the fight against online piracy, he said in a statement.Web organisations have raised concerns about possible effects of the Megaupload case on the future of file sharing, cloud storage, and Internet commerce. Various commentators including John C. Dvorak, Glenn Greenwald, and Julian Sanchez have written on the topic as well, particularly as it relates US government powers to take down a web site without a trial, even without new laws like SOPA. In fact, the U.S. Dept of Justice was able to rely on PRO-IP, a law passed back in 2008, in order to shut down Megaupload.People who used Megaupload for personal and business storage, such as large audio and video files for family and work, have also voiced their complaints about the fact that they no longer had access to their files on the service. Examples cited in the media included staff at public interest group Public Knowledge who used it for large files, and Android cellphone software writers who described it as 'one of the best ways to distribute [software] ... There are a number of similar sites for this use, but Megaupload was always the fastest'.In response to the shutdown, a number of other file hosting websites changed the functionality of their services. FileSonic.com, one of the top ten file hosting services, withdrew the ability to share links to files. The site's main page added a banner stating 'All sharing functionality on FileSonic is now disabled. Our service can only be used to upload and retrieve files that you have uploaded personally.' Other file hosting websites followed suit, including FileServe.com, FileJungle.com, Uploadstation.com, x7.to and 4shared.com, by shutting down, cancelling affiliate programs or allowing users to only download what they themselves uploaded. Another large file-sharing website, Uploaded.to, ceased services for users accessing from United States-based IP addresses. BTJunkie, a website indexing torrent files, shut down voluntarily on 6 February 2012. The file hosting site Turbobit.net blocked access to U.S. visitors, and QuickSilverScreen, a site offering streaming video links, closed on 7 February 2012.However, other file hosting companies felt no need to change, with MediaFire's CEO Derek Labian saying that he and his file hosting company are not concerned by the Megaupload incident because 'Megaupload was making a ridiculous amount of money with a ridiculously bad service... We don't have a business built on copyright infringement.' A spokesperson for RapidShare similarly expressed a lack of concern, saying that 'file hosting itself is a legitimate business', pointing out that Microsoft's OneDrive operates on a similar basis.References2012 in law 2012 in New Zealand Kim Dotcom New Zealand case law Law enforcement in New Zealand 2012 in New Zealand law New Zealand–United States relations", "machine_text": " The Megaupload legal case was an ongoing criminal case in the United States concerning the now-defunct file sharing website Megaupload and its founder, Kim Dotcom. It began on January 19, 2012, when the U.S. Department of Justice initiated criminal proceedings against Megaupload and indicted seven people associated with the website on copyright infringement, racketeering, and money laundering charges. Megaupload was a website that allowed users to upload, store, and download large files. Founded in 2005 by Kim Dotcom, who also owns the sister companies Megavideo, Megalive, and Megaporn, the website was used by millions of people to share pirated copies of copyrighted film, music and software. In January 2012, U.S. authorities, in collaboration with law enforcement in New Zealand, raided Kim Dotcom's home and shut down Megaupload. The U.S. government accused Kim and his associates of engaging in a criminal conspiracy, by using the Megaupload website to commit criminal copyright infringement, as well as making money from piracy. In March that year, the U.S. Department of Justice filed criminal charges against seven people, including Kim Dotcom and his associates, for their involvement in the Megaupload website. The charges included copyright infringement, racketeering, and money laundering, and the seven were indicted on a total of 13 counts. Over the course of the next two years, the Megaupload legal case became increasingly complex and publicized. The U.S. government sought extradition of the accused and unsuccessfully attempted to issue a warrant to seize over 67 million worth of assets held by the defendant. In 2014, the New Zealand High Court found that the defendants had been subject to an illegal search and seizure, and ruled that U.S. authorities had failed to meet the necessary criteria for their arrest and extradition. The DOJ then chose to continue pursuing the criminal case against Kim Dotcom and his associates. The criminal case against Megaupload and the defendants remains ongoing. In 2017, the New Zealand Supreme Court confirmed that the extradition process is still underway, but no further updates have been provided. The case has also resulted in an increasing awareness of copyright infringement and the illegal exchange of intellectual property over the internet. It also provided a wake-up call for Kim Dotcom and the tech industry, who now face stricter regulation when it comes to copyright infringement, piracy, and racketeering.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 36627336}

Winter in a close election that had a turnout of 515,474 voters and was decided by less than 10,000 votes. Fordice was a first-time candidate for political office, but had been active in the Mississippi Republican Party for several years. He had the backing of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, President George H. W. Bush, and Bush's son, Governor George W. Bush of Texas. Fordice campaigned on a platform of fiscal conservatism, job creation, and tax reform. Winter, a veteran politician and former Governor, was supported by President Bill Clinton, as well as Mississippi’s Democratic politicians. He intended to expand educational and economic opportunities, while continuing the social progress initiated by Mabus during his time in office. Fordice won the election despite weak fundraising due to President Bush's unpopularity in the state. He was able to draw in support from conservative voters and those residing in rural, predominantly white, areas of the state. Fordice was sworn into office on January 13, 1992, becoming the first Republican Governor of Mississippi since Reconstruction. He was re-elected in 1995, beating Secretary of State Whit Hughes and leading to Mississippi being dubbed the 'most Republican state in the union' in both the 1996 and 2000 presidential elections. Fordice served two terms until January 11, 2000. During his time in office, Mississippi's economic growth increased, with gains in jobs, education, and infrastructure.

Synonyms for the species include Rhogeessa bombyx (Thomas, 1913), Rhogeessa riparia (Goodwin, 1958), and Rhogeessa velilla (Thomas, 1903). The Thomas's yellow bat was formerly included as a subspecies of the black-winged little yellow bat, but was considered distinct in 1996.The species needs taxonomic review for a number of reasons. One of these reasons includes the possibility that subspecies of the Thomas's yellow bat may be their own species.Range and conservationThomas's yellow bat is native to Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Nicaragua, Panama, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela. It is listed as 'Least Concern' by the IUCN Red List due to its wide distribution, presumed large population, occurrence in a number of protected areas, having some degree of tolerance to habitat modification, and unlikeliness of population decline at the rate to qualify for a more threatened listing.Behavior and ecologyThomas's yellow bat inhabits many habitats, such as both evergreen and deciduous forest, thorn shrub, open areas, and villages, though it appears to favor slightly disturbed deciduous forests. Like other species in its genus, the Thomas's yellow bat can take refuge in buildings and hollow trees, although its roosts are unknown.The species is crepuscular, with peaks of activity within an hour of both dusk and of dawn, flying low to the ground along wide trails or roads. The Thomas's yellow bat is an insectivore, feeding on small, flying insects and with established hunting routes among individuals.The maximum energy of echolocation calls in the Thomas's yellow bat is 50 to 60 kHz.See alsoBlack-winged little yellow batReferencesRhogeessa Bats of Central America Bats of South America Mammals of Colombia Taxa named by Oldfield Thomas Mammals described in 1903", "machine_text": " Thomas's yellow bat (Cypselurus thomensis) is a species of fish belonging to the flyingfish family, Exocoetidae. It is native to the western Pacific from Taiwan to the Ryukyu Islands and Malaysia. The species is not often encountered and is little-studied. Thomas's yellow bat is a small species of flyingfish, growth up to 11.5 centimeters (4.53 in) in length. It has a slender body. The body and fins are yellowish in color, while the upper surface is blackish. Five or six spines are found along its back. Its eyes are small and positioned close to the mouth. The species is primarily a schooling fish which is found in shallow coastal areas. Common habitats for this species include coral reefs, areas with seagrass, and estuaries where they can feed on zooplankton. Adults of this species are capable of short gliding flights over the surface of the water for a few seconds and may be found skimming over the surface at night. Currently, there are no major threats to Thomas's yellow bat. It is an abundant species, found in mixed schools near shore and is captured regularly as by-catch in fisheries. However, it may be vulnerable to overfishing and habitat destruction. Thomas's yellow bat is of limited commercial interest and is not commonly marketed fresh due to its small size. Reports of it in the aquarium trade are rare. Its conservation is not monitored and no protective measures for the species exist. Thomas's yellow bat is one of many flyingfish species found in Southeast Asian waters and a common component of the local marine biodiversity. While little research has been done on the species, research into the ecology of flyingfish in general is considered to be an important task for determining the conservation status of the species.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 38891692}

The tomb consists of a single-chamber rectangular structure cut into a low hillside. It is constructed of large stone slabs that are still firmly in place, supporting a few small stone walls. Inside the chamber is a small altar, built of the same beige stone found in other ancient Judean tombs. It is believed to be the largest single chamber structure discovered in the entire region. The sides of the chamber are covered in stunningly preserved inscriptions in ancient Hebrew, depicting a genealogy of the family of Adam and Eve. On the walls of the chamber, the names of each descendant of Adam and Eve can be found. Additionally, there are depictions of a woman, a man with a staff, a tree and a variety of animals. The Tomb of Eve is one of the longest surviving architectural sites in the Judean Desert. It is part of the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) World Heritage List since 2012.

It was built by the British between 1897 and 1899, and is located close to Fort Tas-Silġ. Today, the battery still exists, but it is not accessible to the public.History The Wolseley Battery is nicknamed by locals as Tal-Basal, meaning 'of the onions'. It was built between 1897 and 1899 to defend the area stretching from Delimara Point to Xrobb l-Għaġin. It formed part of a new series of fortifications meant to house breech-loading (BL) guns. The 18th century Tombrell Battery was demolished in the 19th century to clear Wolseley Battery's line of fire.The battery has an oval plan with four gun emplacements, which originally contained two 9.2 inch and two 6 inch BL guns. The gun emplacements are surrounded by a shallow ditch, which was originally defended by barbed wire entanglements. The rear of the battery was sealed off by an iron fence. The battery also had machine gun emplacements, and it was the first fortification in Malta to have these features.Wolseley Battery became obsolete by 1906, and its 6-inch guns were transferred to the newly built Wardija Battery near St. Paul's Bay in 1915. The battery was fully decommissioned a year later in 1916.A stone-clad pillbox was built behind the officers' quarters in the 1930s.Present day Today, the battery still exists, but there is no public access since it is private property. It is located close to the Delimara Power Station.In 2015, the battery was shortlisted as a possible site for the campus of the proposed American University of Malta. It was not chosen, and the campus was split up between Dock No. 1 in Cospicua and Żonqor Point in Marsaskala.ReferencesMarsaxlokk British fortifications in Malta Batteries in Malta Military installations established in 1899 Military installations closed in 1916 19th-century fortifications", "machine_text": " The Wolseley Battery was a unique combination of artillery and infantry divisions of the British Army before World War I. It was created to support the British advance towards Germany in 1914. The battery was initially formed with nine 6-pounder (57 mm) quick firing guns, manned by the Royal Artillery. The guns were mounted on wheeled carriages and drawn by pack horses. They were designed to fire quickly and accurately, making them suitable for use in the close engagements expected in a modern war. The guns could fire shrapnel and high explosive shells, both of which had fire control routines so the British infantry could gain a tactical advantage. Alongside the Royal Artillery gunners, the Wolseley Battery was supported by a detachment of Riflemen from the King's Royal Rifle Corps, who carried out reconnaissance and other supporting roles such as providing covering fire in case the guns came under attack. In addition, the Battery was equipped with machine guns, mortars and signalling equipment. The machine guns were used as light weaponry, and the mortar was included to provide quick and accurate support during engagements. The signalling equipment was essential for communication between the Battery and the forward line. The Battery was originally commanded by Major G. A. Browne who became the highest ranking artillery officer in the Royal Artillery. He was later replaced by Major F. M. P. White, with Lieutenant G. C. Symes acting as second-in-command. The Battery quickly gained a reputation for their accuracy and swiftness, so much so that by October 1914 it was attached to the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). It was under the command of the 1st Division of the BEF, where it participated in the first engagements of World War One in Belgium. During this time, the Battery gained recognition and respect from both sides of the war, as they were able to quickly and accurately engage enemy targets, often with devastating results. After the War, the Battery was decommissioned and disbanded, with the guns and personnel re-assigned to other artillery units. However, the name ‘Wolseley Battery’ continues to be associated with Britain’s artillery and infantry divisions, even to this day. The legacy of the Wolseley Battery continues to this day, with a museum dedicated to the Battery’s service in France located in Redhill, Surrey. The museum holds a variety of artefacts and memorabilia from the War, and is open to the public daily. The Battery’s role in shaping the British Army’s tactics, equipment and leadership as it entered the twentieth century has been accurately depicted in the museum. The Battery’s actions and successes during the First World War have been recognised by the Royal Artillery and by the British Army as a whole. The Battery’s name is continued on various honours and awards, including the awarding of the King’s Medal in 1918 and a memorial erected in the Royal Artillery Park in London in 1921. In 2006, the Battery was included in the Queen’s Birthday Honours list. The Wolseley Battery’s legacy is seen as a strong one, representing Britain’s ability to rapidly develop effective field artillery during the First World War. Its use of advanced tactics, weapons and personnel has been remembered as a turning point in the development of British military strategy. The Battery’s story stands as a testament to the capability and skill of the British forces.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 46963530}

It was pioneered in 1851 by William Nobles, who discovered an easy shortcut between the Applegate Trail in Nevada and the Lassen Trail in California. The trail was extensively used until the 1870s, when it was superseded by railroads.Discovery and establishment The main trail to California in the 1840s was the California Trail, which followed the Humboldt River in Nevada, then the Truckee River, and over the Donner Pass in California. A northern variation was pioneered by the Applegate brothers in 1846, using a more northerly route that connected with destinations in Oregon. Peter Lassen established a variant route that passed Lassen Peak on the way to the Sacramento area. Lassen scouted the area of Honey Lake with William H. Nobles for a legendary 'Gold Lake', but having failed, they parted company, with Nobles continuing to the east and accidentally scouting a shorter, easier trail than Lassen's.Nobles, born in New York in 1816, had moved to Minnesota in 1841 to work as a carpenter, then as a carpenter and wagon-maker. By 1851 he had moved on to California. When Nobles returned to California from his expedition with Lassen, he showed a party ofbusinessmen the route for a fee of 2000. With the subscribers vouching for the usefulness of theroute, he returned to Minnesota in 1853 to promote the route, marrying in Illinois along the way. The Minnesota legislature commissioned Nobles to present the route to Congress in Washington. Nobles' efforts persuaded Congress to appropriate300,000 for an expedition along the route, led by Frederick W. Lander, who prepared a favorable report in February 1861. The route became known as the Fort Kearney, South Pass and Honey Lake Wagon Road. Nobles was elected to the Minnesota Territorial Legislature and died in St. Paul in 1876. The trail was briefly considered for a railroad route. Its popularity contributed to the founding of Susanville and Redding.Historic designation Thesection of trail within the boundaries of Lassen Volcanic National Park was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 3, 1975. The section within the park is maintained as a hiking trail.The trail has two California Historical Landmark markers: #675 marks a stopping place along the Noble Emigrant Trail that William Nobles established near the present-day city of Susanville, while #677 marks the spot where Peter Lassen first saw Honey Lake on October 4, 1850, while on his search for 'Gold Lake'.Lassen Volcanic National Park The trail within the park starts in the northeast corner, passing the edge of the Cinder Cone and the Fantastic Lava Beds, then skirting Prospect Peak. Crossing Badger Flats and passing through the Devastated Area associated with the May 21, 1915 eruption of Lassen Peak. The trail parallels the Lassen Park Road, then passes between the Chaos Crags and Table Mountain, across Sunflower Flat and over Nobles Pass, following the edge of the Chaos Jumbles. The trail leaves the northwest corner of the park near Manzanita Lake.ReferencesHistoric trails and roads in California Hiking trails in California Roads on the National Register of Historic Places in California National Register of Historic Places in Lassen Volcanic National Park Protected areas of Lassen County, California History of Lassen County, California Protected areas of Shasta County, California Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in California National Register of Historic Places in Shasta County, California", "machine_text": " The Nobles Emigrant Trail was a route constructed by Mormon settlers in the mid-1800s in order to travel between the Salt Lake Valley and the Deseret settlement near the Great Salt Lake in Utah. The route connected the two settlements by way of some key fortifications located along the way, providing protection for travelers and other travelers who used it for transportation purposes. The Nobles Emigrant Trail was originally constructed in 1847. It was built from the shore of the Great Salt Lake up the Weber River, skirting Willard Bay, before it eventually split off into two branches. One branch of the trail turned northeast, eventually reaching the settlements in Park Valley and Circle Valley while the other proceeded northwest before turning south, heading to the settlements in the Parowan Valley and the Muddy River. The Mormon settlers constructed several fortifications along the Nobles Emigrant Trail, including the Fort Willard, located along the Weber River and Fort Tooele, as well as several other smaller fortifications. The purpose of these fortifications was to provide protection for the travelers, allowing them to stop and rest if needed along the trail. The Noble Emigrant Trail was used extensively by both the Mormon settlers and other travelers in the area during the 1800s. It served as an important transportation link for travelers, allowing for the transport of goods, mail, and even people between the two settlements. The trail also functioned as a military and trade route, providing a crucial connection between Salt Lake City and the settlements in the Deseret, Park Valley, and Circle Valley regions. The Nobles Emigrant Trail eventually fell into disuse around 1850 and is no longer visible. However, some of the fortifications along the route are still visible today. These sites are significant for their historical and cultural value for the region, having served as an important transportation route through the mid-1800s. Today, the Nobles Emigrant Trail is remembered through several historical markers and sites located throughout Salt Lake City and the communities that line the route. The trail is also commemorated through the Nobles Emigrant Trail Museum, which provides exhibits and presentations about the trail's history and importance. These historical markers provide important insight into the region's early history and development, creating an invaluable record of its past.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 22865676}

The calligrapher is thought to be the same on the five scrolls as on the hell scroll and the demon of punishment, which were produced at roughly the same time. They are thought to have originally been a single handscroll, known as the 'second edition of the Masuda family hell scroll', that was stored in the Rengeō-in Temple (now Sanjūsangen-dō). The paintings depict five benevolent deities in combat against evil, as represented by demons; the deities come from several cultures, including contemporary Japanese, Chinese, and Indian. They are thought to be associated with the hell transformation screens then used in Nara for repentance ceremonies at the end of each year, where the devout recited the names of the buddhas at Heijō Palace.The paintings were designated National Treasures of Japan on 6 June 1985, with the accession number 1106.

Through rituals, spells, and other techniques, the aim is to vanquish the perceived “evil” and restore peace, balance and harmony. During an Extermination of Evil, a person or area is cleansed, purified, and restored back to a natural and balanced state. The term “Extermination of Evil” is often used to refer to the exorcism of a person or an area. Extermination of Evil practices can be found in many cultures around the world. Exterminations of Evil can be traced back over 5000 years, with rituals and techniques being found in Ancient Egypt and Palestine. The Catholic Church has also incorporated Exorcism and Extermination of Evil practices into its religious practices. The Judaic faith also has rites and rituals that may be used in the Extermination of Evil, and in Asia, Taoism and Shintoism have similar rituals. Most traditions agree that Evil and spiritual “demons” exist, and their influence can manifest itself in a variety of ways, such as physical or mental health issues, emotional disturbances, or spiritual unrest. Extermination of Evil helps to remove these influences and restore balance. Most Extermination of Evil practices involve rituals which either expel or vanquish the Evil. These rituals may involve the use of words, prayers, instruments, gestures, and/or objects. Another component of Extermination of Evil is cleansing the person or area with holy water, smoke, incense, or other ritual objects. Once the ritual is complete, the practitioner may perform a ritual blessing, in order to create positive energy and restore the spiritual balance. Extermination of Evil can be used to rid a person of bad spiritual influences. However, it is important to remember that this method should only be used when all other means of restoring balance and harmony have been exhausted. It is also important to seek out a qualified practitioner, preferably one with experience in Extermination of Evil rituals, in order to ensure a successful result. Extermination of Evil can be an effective way to rid one's life of negative spiritual influences.

The Parsa region is inhabited by the Magar, Gurung, and Thakuri people, who have lived in the area for several generations. The modern Parsa people are the descendants of the ancient Parsa people. They speak their own Parso language, which is a dialect of Newar that belongs to the Sino-Tibetan family. It is spoken in the Parsa District of Nepal, as well as in a number of small pockets in North India. The region has been continuously inhabited for thousands of years and has a strong cultural identity and a distinct ethnic identity. There are a number of Hindu religious sites in the Parsa region and numerous historical monuments that serve as evidence to its rich history and ancient culture. The Parsa culture is also known for its distinctive and beautiful art forms, as well as various types of musical instruments from the region. The art pieces and sculptures are typically done in a fusion of the traditional Hindu, Buddhist and Tantric styles, giving them a unique look and feel. The traditional instruments and music of the Parsa culture can be listed out to include a wide array of drums, flutes, harps, and fiddles, each of which have their own regional variations. Additionally, the Parsa culture is known for its unique culinary specialties. The region is especially famous for its Dumplings, Paratha, and the unique Newari Thali Mi. The Parsa region is also home to some of the best herbal medicinal preparations. The Parsa culture is a unique cultural gem of the Himalayan region and should be appreciated for its rich history, complex culture, and unique art forms and music. It should be celebrated and explored to the fullest as it provides an opportunity to better understand the heritage of the Central Himalayan region.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 3396893}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Monroe piercing\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "A Monroe piercing is a lip piercing placed off-center, above the upper lip on the left-hand side and is meant to resemble Marilyn Monroe's beauty spot, although Monroe's beauty spot was on her cheek, not her lip. The Madonna piercing is similar but worn on the right-hand side.Description This piercing is typically fitted with a 14, 16, or 18 gauge labret barbell, the bars of which are usually shortened after healing.A variation on this piercing are angel bites, with both the Madonna and Monroe style piercings worn on either side of the upper lip. This piercing may also be referred to as a Crayfish, Angel Bites, or Anti Bites, being the anti version of snake bites. When long barbells are worn in this piercing, they look similar to the antennae on a crayfish, hence the name. Most people with a Monroe piercing favor a metal ball or a jewel on the outer-end. The lip can often swell considerably after the piercing and will need both facial and oral aftercare to keep both sides of the jewelry clean at all times. Monroes, like all piercings, are prone to infection and it is vital that the piercing is cleaned regularly. Scarring is minimal to none if properly taken care of.Health impacts An advantage of a monroe piercing is that the lip area generally heals faster than other piercings.The estimated healing time given by professional piercers for this type of lip piercing is between 8–12 weeks, but many find it heals in 3–6 weeks.The monroe can be a very painful piercing process, as this area of the body contains a large system of nerves. There is a small risk of piercing the superior labial artery, which lies just above the upper lip.The amount of pain experienced during the piercing process differs from person to person and depends on the specific location of the piercing. Those with thicker lips or well-exercised facial muscles will have more flesh or muscle to pierce, so they may experience more discomfort. Men may experience slightly more pain than women, as repeated shaving can make the skin of the upper lip tougher and harder to pierce. The orbicularis oris (the sphincter muscle around the mouth) is used in the playing of brass and woodwind instruments; as a result, players of these instruments tend to have a larger muscle around the mouth and may experience more discomfort during the piercing process.As with similar piercings, monroes can cause long-term damage to the gums and teeth. The back-disk of metal jewellery worn in this piercing rubs against them, potentially resulting in gum recession or damage to tooth enamel. Plastic labret-studs are available to minimize this problem.ReferencesFacial piercings Marilyn Monroe Madonna (entertainer) de:Labret-Piercing#Madonna-Piercing", "machine_text": " A Monroe piercing, sometimes called Madonna piercing, or Crawford piercing, is a facial piercing through the upper lip. It is located to one side, just above the upper lip and is sometimes confused with a labret piercing due to it’s similar placement. Monroe piercings are also sometimes called Crawford piercings as a homage to the actress who famously revealed she had this piercing. Because the piercing is more complicated than others, Monroe piercings require a longer healing time- 4 to 8 weeks. A curved barbell is the most recommended piece of jewelry for Monroe piercings aesthetically but a ring can also work. It is important to stay away from metal that contains nickel as this can cause irritation. The risks of getting a Monroe piercing are minimal but they should nonetheless be taken into account. The top of the upper lip can become slightly swollen due to the piercing and experience some minor bleeding. If bleeding continues, it is advised that the recipient seek medical attention. In addition to this, oral piercings can carry a risk of HIV and hepatitis, so should be avoided if possible. To ensure that a Monroe piercing heals evenly and doesn’t get infected, the following procedures are often recommended: • Clean the area with an aftercare solution regularly. • Avoid touching the piercing with unwashed hands. • Rinse the mouth with warm water and a saline solution regularly. • Avoid dirt and debris from entering the piercing. • Change jewelry regularly to ensure that the piercing doesn’t moos • Discontinue use of any substance that can cause irritation. Monroe piercings can be a great way to add a unique flair to one’s appearance. The piercing is not that painful and can heal quickly if the proper aftercare procedures are followed. If done correctly, people may even forget it’s there - it can be beneath one’s skin for a long time without causing any irritation. It’s also a relatively easy piercing to hide and can be easily covered up. With its subtlety and uniqueness, Monroe piercings can accentuate one’s face while making an interesting statement.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 5578644}

Even though it has rarely been sighted, this gulper eel was chosen to be the logo for MBARI.Distribution Saccopharynx lavenbergi occurs in the eastern Pacific Ocean.Description The species is very similar to others in the genus Saccopharynx, featuring large mouths and long slender bodies. It is typically dark in color and has small eyes. This is probably because at the depths these eels dwell, there is little to no light from the sun. They also feature a bioluminescent organ at the tips of their long tails, the function of which is currently unknown.Ecology It occurs at depths of . It has been hypothesized that the large mouth of the eel allows it to swallow prey much larger than itself.While no specimens have been observed mating in the wild, observations of dead specimens have led scientists to believe that this species dies after mating, much like freshwater eels.Taxonomy and phylogenyIn 2003, researchers from the University of Tokyo sequenced mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from specimens of Eurypharynx pelicanoides and Saccopharynx lavenbergi. After comparing the sequences from the specimens with other known sequences, they found that Eurypharynx pelicanoides and Saccopharynx lavenbergi were closely related and had mitochondrial genomes distinct from other Anguilliformes.ReferencesSaccopharyngidae Fish of the Pacific Ocean Fish described in 1985 Taxa named by Jørgen G.

This species is found in the tropical and subtropical waters of the Indian and western Pacific oceans, from Sri Lanka to the Philippines, and from southern Japan to the Great Barrier Reef. It is often found near coral reefs, at depths of between 35 and 400 metres. S. lavenbergi has a slender body, with an elongated snout and large eyes. It is silver-gray in colour, and grows to an average length of 7 to 10 cm. It has an upturned mouth and is able to consume items such as jellyfish, squid and small crustaceans. The reproductive biology of S. lavenbergi is poorly known, but it is thought to spawn annually and disperse the eggs into the ocean. Mature adults reach sexual maturity at 4.5 to 5 cm in length. Eggs have been located at depths of 1027 metres. S. lavenbergi is frequently caught as bycatch by various fishing operations, although it has no marketed value. Management measures have been taken to reduce the number of S. lavenbergi caught in fishing nets, such as the use of turtle excluder devices and bycatch mitigation nets. The IUCN has listed S. lavenbergi as Data Deficient, due to inadequate knowledge of the species’ reproductive rate, population trends and threats to its survival.

Added to the Virginia Historic Landmark Registry in 1982.About the millIn 1749, Thomas Lord Fairfax issued a land grant forto George Brock. Brock sold this land in 1757 to Andrew Zirkle, who had arrived in the area in 1755 with four brothers, two sisters and his mother. Shortly thereafter, Andrew and his brothers built the mill.While the exact date of the construction of the mill remains a mystery, there is a variety of evidence that shows it was built and in operation by 1781. Anecdotal evidence places its construction in the early 1760s.The mill has a log frame and uses mortice and tenon construction. The main beams of the mill, of which there are six, are huge timber beams. These beams are one piece, each of which arelong and over one foot square. The mill rests on a coursed rubblestone foundation built into the hillside.A portion of the mill foundation rests on solid bed of limestone that protrudes from the hill. There is also a large natural cleft in the rocks where the waterwheel now resides.The waterwheel is fed by a mill race that extends nearly 1/2 mile upstream to the mill dam located on Holman's Creek.As it nears the mill, the water runs into a raised wooden flume to be fed to the Fitz Waterwheel.The waterwheel is 20½ feet in diameter andwide. It was manufactured by the Fitz Waterwheel company of Hanover, PA was installed in the spring of 1921.Inside the mill is a collection of equipment spanning the entire lifespan of the mill.The original granite and French quartz millstones are present, roller milling machines installed just before 1900, sifters, bolters, and other items. The mill also features a Fitz gearing installed in the basement that takes the power from the waterwheel and uses it to drive all the equipment.History of the millThe American historian George Bancroft writes of contributions made by citizens to relieve 'the poor of Boston' during the hardships caused by the blockading of the harbor after the Boston Tea Party. Bancroft specifically mentions contributions made by settlers in the Northern Shenandoah Valley, citingof flour being brought into Winchester. The Boston Tea Party occurred in December 1773 and with the passage of the Intolerable Acts which contained the Boston Port Bill, the harbor was ordered closed June 1, 1774.In 'A History of Shenandoah County', written by Shenandoah Valley historian John W. Wayland, these contributions are cited and Wayland gives his interpretation of Bancrofts' writings, stating that mills of Shenandoah County provided some of this flour. It is family tradition that the Zirkle Mill was one of the sources for this flour. This claim is given further credence by the Shenandoah County Publick Claims which show that in 1781 Andrew Zirkle contributed six barrels of flour to the Continental Army.The mill is mentioned in a 1784 petition from local residents to build a road from the mill east to the town of New Market, VA.Andrew Zirkle, his brother Michael and other residents signed the petition.The Order Book of Shenandoah County Court lists instructions for Michael Zirkle, Andrew Zirkle, Jacob Neff and Benjamin Fossett 'view a way for a Road from Andrew Sircles Mill to Abraham Dusks Smith Shop on the Main Road' and that they report their findings to the next court.In 1817, Andrew directed the executor of his will to sell the mill and distribute the proceeds among his descendants. The mill was subsequently sold to George Mowrey who was apparently his miller at the time. Mowery was unable to hold onto the mill and it passed through a number of owners until it was purchased by Peter Myers who lived just outside Forestville, VA in 1853.War had once again come to the valley as the north and south faced off against each other in the Civil War. After driving Confederate General Jubal Early from the field at the Battle of Fisher's Hill, Union General Phillip Sheridan pursued him as far south as Harrisonburg and McGaheysville, Virginia. There he stopped as he feared Confederate Troops from the Richmond area might move to his rear and trap his army between two forces.General Sheridan received orders from General Ulysses S. Grant to burn 'the breadbasket of the Confederacy.' Sheridan then executed a strategic retreat northward towards Winchester and Union troops rode the width of the valley setting fields, barns and mills ablaze.At the Zirkle Mill, the miller Samuel Hockman climbed the hill facing the mill. In the distance he could see the mills at nearby Moore's Store, Harpinetown and the Myers farm being set ablaze. He ran and got a Union Flag, climbed onto the roof of the mill and hung it there.He ran to meet the Union Cavalry officers in the road. The flag and his pleadings convinced them of his sincerity and the troops were ordered to leave the mill alone. It was the only mill on Holman's creek to survive that day. The General in charge of the Union Cavalry in this area was none other than George Armstrong Custer.This fantastic tale is recounted in 'The Burning: Sheridan in the Shenandoah Valley' by Professor John Heatwhole.After the war, the local people branded Hockman as a Union sympathizer and refused to patronize the mill and soon the owner Peter Myers was forced to sell.Joseph Andrick purchased the mill in 1867 and operated it until his death in 1893. His sons Casper and Charles ran the mill for a number of years and upgraded the mill by installing roller milling equipment. Much of this equipment is still in the mill today.After the Andrick brothers sold the mill in 1906 it again passed through a number of owners hands each trying his hand at the milling trade. Finally, in the late 1940s, no longer able to compete with modernized factories the mill finally ceased operations after 180 years.Mill campaignThe mill sat neglected for many years until in 1980 it was bought by a North Carolina carpenter named Glen Hofecker, who restored it to working order. It was during this time that the mill was added to the Virginia Historic Landmark Register in 1992 and then placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993.Hofecker sold the mill at auction in 1992 to Bowman Fruit Sales, LLC controlled by Gordon D. 'Sonny' Bowman, a local orchardist.Bowman Fruit Sales owned the mill for 11 years and then decided to sell it. The mill was placed on the open market for a year with no takers. Finally, the Frontier Culture Museum of Staunton, Virginia came calling. They were looking for a mill to be the centerpiece of an exhibit on 1850s life and announced plans to move the upper portion of the mill to museum property in Staunton, Virginia. Two Zirkle descendants, Rob Andrews and Sherryl Andrews Belinsky formed the Save the Zirkle Mill Foundation (now called Old Dominion Preservation) and conducted a year-long campaign to save the mill.The Frontier Culture Museum is state funded and is restricted by acquisition laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia. The purchase of the mill property was highly irregular. After taking the case to the State Attorney General's office, the Attorney General issued an opinion stating that the Governor of Virginia must approve the acquisition of the mill by the museum as dictated by state laws.In July 2005, Governor Mark Warner denied the acquisition of the mill by the museum. Bowman Fruit Sales waited a few months and quietly put the mill up for sale again. While it had become famous, there were few takers. Andrews and Belinsky made an offer for the mill and on January 5, 2006 became the owners of the Andrew Zirkle Mill.A new beginningThe new owners have begun the process of bringing the mill back to life.While the project is expected to take many years, plans are being made and events have been held to further this goal.Signage has been added to the property and recently a historic highway marker was added in the parking lot across the road from the mill.The Highway Marker was donated by the Knight-Patty Fund of the Virginia Society of the Sons of the American Revolution.A number of site improvements are underway and a portion of the grounds has been turned to agricultural use.Due to the numerous safety improvements required and the need to proceed slowly with changes, the mill is currently closed to the public.ReferencesExternal linkswww.historiczirklemill.orgGrinding mills on the National Register of Historic Places in Virginia National Register of Historic Places in Shenandoah County, Virginia Industrial buildings completed in 1781 Buildings and structures in Shenandoah County, Virginia Grinding mills in Virginia German-American culture in Virginia Pennsylvania German culture in Virginia", "machine_text": " Zirkle Mill is a gristmill that is located in Port republic, Virginia. It is the oldest remaining working mill in Rockingham County and one of the oldest mills in the state. The mill has been in operation since at least 1818 and was originally owned by the Zirkle family. The original mill was powered by a wooden waterwheel with a 15-foot diameter. In 1821, the mill was converted to use a larger, steel waterwheel and a turbine to generate power. The turbine was fueled by local streams and was used to power the grinding stones. The mill also has an attached sawmill powered by the same turbine. The Zirkle Mill is a three-story structure made of stone and brick. The first floor of the building is devoted to the grinding and packaging of grain, while the second floor is used for storage. The sawmill and turbine are located in a separate building behind the main structure. The mill is still in operation today and is the last remaining milling operation in Port republic. The mill is open to the public and offers tours to visitors who can observe the grinding and sawing of the grain or visit the museum to learn more about the history of the mill.

The standard enables researchers and developers to accurately and expansively describe the structure of digital documents in a way that is computer readable and consistent. It is an effort by the digital preservation community at large to create consistent methods for capturing the structure of documents for digital preservation. DSD is a way of encapsulating the elements of a document's structure into an easily understood format. This format includes information about the physical characteristics of the document, such as its dimensions, paper size and formatting, and the logical components of the document, such as the section headings, tables and images. The structure is described in XML, a standard markup language. By capturing the structure of documents, it allows archivists, librarians and other digital preservation professionals to more accurately capture the contents of a document, its context and its original meaning. This can help in preserving the document in its original form, which can be difficult as documents can change over time due to software incompatibilities and other factors. DSD was developed by the Digital Preservation Coalition (DPC), an organization that promotes digital preservation standards and best practices. DSD is based on the Encoded Archival Description (EAD) standard, and was first published in 2010. It is now managed and maintained by the DPC. DSD is beneficial to digital preservation professionals because it provides a consistent description of the structure of documents that is machine-readable and will facilitate the reuse and reuse of digital documents. The DSD standard has been adopted by several national archives, libraries and museums, making it an important standard for digital preservation professionals. In addition to providing a consistent framework for describing the structure of digital documents, DSD also provides a mechanism for capturing the relationships between documents and their components. This can be used to create an archival structure for digital documents, to link documents together, or to capture provenance information. DSD is an important step in ensuring that digital documents are well-structured, accessible and reusable. The standard is quickly becoming an important tool for digital preservation professionals in their efforts to save history for the future.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1545534}

Constantin Eftimiu was born in Turnu-Severin, Romania in 1887. He was the son of Nicolae and Ruxandra Eftimiu, both of whom were teachers. He earned his Bachelor's degree at the University of Iasi in 1908 and his Ph.D. in 1911, then studied philosophy and drama at the Sorbonne in Paris. Eftimiu is best known for his lyric poetry, which expresses a passionate patriotism and love of nature. His later plays, such as The Eternal Son (1912) and The Refugees (1922), were unable to match the success of his earlier works. From 1920 to 1940 he was the director of the National Theatre in Bucharest. As a poet, Eftimiu showed a great range of styles. His early works, such as Moş Ion Roată (1908), combine traditional poetic forms with modern themes. His later works, such as Dogma Despre Viaţă (1912) and Amurg de toamnă (1921), rely more on symbol and imagery. Eftimiu's strongest themes were related to patriotism and the history of Romania. He often focused on heroes of Romanian history, such as Mihai Viteazul, and encouraged Romanians to rise to their original glory. In addition to being a poet and playwright, Eftimiu was an influential and prolific theater director. He was a great promoter of both Romanian and foreign plays. At the National Theatre, he staged works by authors such as A. P. Chekhov, George Bernard Shaw and Henrik Ibsen. He also directed his own plays, such as The Refugees and The Eternal Son. During his lifetime, Eftimiu received numerous awards and honors. He was awarded the Medal of Honor of Romania in 1919 and the Medal of Honor of France in 1921. He was also made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in London in 1957. After his death in 1973, the Constantin Eftimiu Cultural Foundation was established in his honor. Constantin Eftimiu was an important figure in the development of Romanian culture in the early 20th century. His writings, particularly his lyric poetry and plays, expressed a passionate patriotism and love of nature. His influence extended beyond his works, as he was also an influential theater director, who introduced audiences to the works of various authors.

In 2009, Tony Abbott defeated Turnbull in a leadership spill 42 votes to 41 in the second round and took on the role of Opposition Leader.The Abbott shadow ministry was the first in which shadow ministers received additional pay for their roles, taking effect from 2012 after a decision of the Gillard government.StructureThe 'opposition front bench' comprises the full shadow ministry including the shadow cabinet, other shadow ministers and shadow parliamentary secretaries. As an institution, the shadow cabinet is much less defined—or studied—than the Cabinet with its well established formal procedures. Shadow Cabinet operates more as a committee of an opposition political party than an institution of Government or Parliament. The Cabinet Handbook was first published in 1926 and the updated version is available on-line but no such equivalent exists for Shadow Cabinet.First arrangement (2009–2010)The Shadow Cabinet of Tony Abbott was created following the accession of Tony Abbott to the leadership in December 2009. It remained largely unchanged until the 2010 election, excluding one minor reshuffle in March 2010.

It was in government from 2013 to 2015 and then at the end of 2014 changed to the 44th ministry. The Shadow Ministry was made of several prominent members of the ALP, including some of its senior executive figures, such as Treasurer Joe Hockey, Deputy Leader Julie Bishop, Shadow Minister for the Environment Greg Hunt, Shadow Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull, and Immigration Spokesman Scott Morrison. The Shadow Ministry of Tony Abbott was responsible for overseeing the policies and activities of the ALP in opposition to the Liberal-National Coalition government in 2013 and 2014. It also was responsible for developing and pursuing an alternative strategy for its policy areas. The Shadow Ministry played a crucial role in the ALP's electoral campaign in 2013 and 2014, by outlining policies to counter government initiatives and outlining opposition policies to win over swing voters in the 2013 Australian federal election. The Shadow Ministry under Abbott was considered to be a more moderate version of the ALP than it had become in the wake of its 2007 election loss, with Abbott considered to be a more centrist leader than previous ALP leader Kevin Rudd. Abbott appointed several prominent figures to his Shadow Ministry, including former National Party leader Barnaby Joyce as Shadow Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, and former Deputy Prime Minister Julie Bishop as Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Shadow Ministry's primary objective was to develop a strategy to oppose and challenge the policies of Prime Minister Tony Abbott's government. Abbott managed to win the federal election of 2013, allowing the ALPs to move into government in September 2013. After the election, the Shadow Ministry was disbanded, with the new ALP Government taking control of all policies and activities in government. The Shadow Ministry of Tony Abbott was unique in Opposition politics and ultimately paved the way for the ALP's victory in the election of 2013. Though it was undoubtedly a difficult period in Opposition politics for the ALP, the Shadow Ministry was ultimately critical in securing the party's success in election and allowing it to move back into government with Abbott as Prime Minister.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 849996}

The species in this genus are known commonly as mud winkles or mud snails, due to their preference for living in mud and burrowing in sand. They are native to shallow waters along the coasts of the western Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and Mediterranean. The shell of Batillaria species is elongate and typically spiral, reaching a length of about 7-10 millimeters. White and yellowish colors form a pattern of lines and nodules on the shell. The narrow slit-like aperture of the shell along the center is very distinctive, as it is present in all species of Batillaria. The operculum, which seals the aperture when the snail retracts, is large and circular in shape. Most species of Batillaria feed on algae and decaying organic matter. Some species may feed on other small invertebrates. They are burrowing animals, so they are rarely seen out of the mud or sand in which they live. In many regions they are very important in the food web of shallow marine habitats. Batillaria can reproduce both sexually and asexually. Asexual reproduction occurs through fragmentation, in which the snail breaks its tail off and later regenerates it. Sexual reproduction occurs through cross-fertilization and involves two separate sexes. These snails are harmless to humans and do not cause significant damage to crops or infrastructure. In some areas they are eaten as food, usually cooked in salt- or brine-water. They are also a popular aquarium species for hobbyists who enjoy the beauty of their colorful shells and enjoy watching them swim and explore their tanks. Batillaria are sensitive to changes in their environment, such as chemical pollution, changes in salinity, and changes in temperature. This sensitivity makes them useful indicators that scientists can use to detect changes in water quality and the general state of shallow marine ecosystems.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 12649662}

Although travelling through time holds no true physical dangers, Dan is informed via newspaper articles at various points in time that he will eventually die in a major disaster, making his journey to prevent the tragedy a primary plotline throughout the series.

In his preface Braithwaite describes himself as being in the service of the African Company, and as having, when very young, served in the fleet in Anne's reign, and then having been a lieutenant in the Welsh fusiliers, ensign in the Royal Guards, and secretary to his kinsman Christian Cole, the British resident at Venice, with whom he traveled through Europe.

He is credited as the first to introduce music into British comedy, revolutionizing the London stage. John Braithwaite was born in London to a family of the middle-class gentry. His father was an attorney and he was educated at a private school in the city. He attended Eton, where he distinguished himself in Latin, Greek, and French and, as an exhibitioner, Oxford, where he studied law. He then trained as an attorney at Lincoln's Inn, but never practiced. Braithwaite first made a name for himself in the theatre, mostly as a writer of farces and comedies. He is best remembered for the popular 1771 play '_High Life Below Stairs_,' which spawned several adaptations and was even later adapted into a successful movie in the 1930s. He directed and acted in his productions, garnering acclaim for their musically-inclined wit. His influence on the London theatre scene is still evident today; for example, he was the first to write original music for the stage, an idea that is now a mainstay of modern British and Broadway theatre. He also wrote adaptations of popular French lyrical comedies, including the hugely successful production '_The Deserter of Naples_' in 1777. His other works included the book _Rural Life: An Essay_ (1774), as well as translations of German works, and a number of political lyrics and satires.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Delta-v budget\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "In astrodynamics and aerospace, a delta-v budget is an estimate of the total change in velocity (delta-v) required for a space mission. It is calculated as the sum of the delta-v required to perform each propulsive maneuver needed during the mission. As input to the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation, it determines how much propellant is required for a vehicle of given empty mass and propulsion system.Delta-v is a scalar quantity dependent only on the desired trajectory and not on the mass of the space vehicle. For example, although more fuel is needed to transfer a heavier communication satellite from low Earth orbit to geosynchronous orbit than for a lighter one, the delta-v required is the same. Delta-v is also additive, as contrasted to rocket burn time, the latter having greater effect later in the mission when more fuel has been used up.Tables of the delta-v required to move between different space regime are useful in the conceptual planning of space missions. In the absence of an atmosphere, the delta-v is typically the same for changes in orbit in either direction; in particular, gaining and losing speed cost an equal effort. An atmosphere can be used to slow a spacecraft by aerobraking.A typical delta-v budget might enumerate various classes of maneuvers, delta-v per maneuver, and number of each maneuver required over the life of the mission, then simply sum the total delta-v, much like a typical financial budget. Because the delta-v needed to achieve the mission usually varies with the relative position of the gravitating bodies, launch windows are often calculated from porkchop plots that show delta-v plotted against the launch time.General principles The Tsiolkovsky rocket equation shows that the delta-v of a rocket (stage) is proportional to the logarithm of the fuelled-to-empty mass ratio of the vehicle, and to the specific impulse of the rocket engine. A key goal in designing space-mission trajectories is to minimize the required delta-v to reduce the size and expense of the rocket that would be needed to successfully deliver any particular payload to its destination.The simplest delta-v budget can be calculated with Hohmann transfer, which moves from one circular orbit to another coplanar circular orbit via an elliptical transfer orbit. In some cases a bi-elliptic transfer can give a lower delta-v.A more complex transfer occurs when the orbits are not coplanar. In that case there is an additional delta-v necessary to change the plane of the orbit. The velocity of the vehicle needs substantial burns at the intersection of the two orbital planes and the delta-v is usually extremely high. However, these plane changes can be almost free in some cases if the gravity and mass of a planetary body are used to perform the deflection. In other cases, boosting up to a relatively high altitude apoapsis gives low speed before performing the plane change, thus requiring lower total delta-v.The slingshot effect can be used to give a boost of speed/energy; if a vehicle goes past a planetary or lunar body, it is possible to pick up (or lose) some of that body's orbital velocity relative to the sun or another planet.Another effect is the Oberth effect—this can be used to greatly decrease the delta-v needed, because using propellant at low potential energy/high speed multiplies the effect of a burn. Thus for example the delta-v for a Hohmann transfer from Earth's orbital radius to Mars's orbital radius (to overcome the sun's gravity) is many kilometres per second, but the incremental burn from low Earth orbit (LEO) over and above the burn to overcome Earth's gravity is far less if the burn is done close to Earth than if the burn to reach a Mars transfer orbit is performed at Earth's orbit, but far away from Earth.A less used effect is low energy transfers. These are highly nonlinear effects that work by orbital resonances and by choosing trajectories close to Lagrange points. They can be very slow, but use very little delta-v.Because delta-v depends on the position and motion of celestial bodies, particularly when using the slingshot effect and Oberth effect, the delta-v budget changes with launch time. These can be plotted on a porkchop plot.Course corrections usually also require some propellant budget. Propulsion systems never provide precisely the right propulsion in precisely the right direction at all times, and navigation also introduces some uncertainty. Some propellant needs to be reserved to correct variations from the optimum trajectory.BudgetLaunch/landingThe delta-v requirements for sub-orbital spaceflight are much lower than for orbital spaceflight. For the Ansari X Prize altitude of 100 km, Space Ship One required a delta-v of roughly 1.4 km/s. To reach the initial low Earth orbit of the International Space Station of 300 km (now 400 km), the delta-v is over six times higher, about 9.4 km/s. Because of the exponential nature of the rocket equation the orbital rocket needs to be considerably bigger.Launch to LEO—this not only requires an increase of velocity from 0 to 7.8 km/s, but also typically 1.5–2 km/s for atmospheric drag and gravity drag Re-entry from LEO—the delta-v required is the orbital maneuvering burn to lower perigee into the atmosphere, atmospheric drag takes care of the rest.Earth–Moon space—high thrustDelta-v needed to move inside the Earth–Moon system (speeds lower than escape velocity) are given in km/s. This table assumes that the Oberth effect is being used—this is possible with high thrust chemical propulsion but not with current (as of 2018) electrical propulsion.Earth–Moon space—low thrustCurrent electric ion thrusters produce a very low thrust (milli-newtons, yielding a small fraction of a g), so the Oberth effect cannot normally be used. This results in the journey requiring a higher delta-v and frequently a large increase in time compared to a high thrust chemical rocket. Nonetheless, the high specific impulse of electrical thrusters may significantly reduce the cost of the flight. For missions in the Earth–Moon system, an increase in journey time from days to months could be unacceptable for human space flight, but differences in flight time for interplanetary flights are less significant and could be favorable.The table below presents delta-vs in km/s, normally accurate to 2 significant figures and will be the same in both directions, unless aerobraking is used as described in the high thrust section above.Earth Lunar Gateway—high thrustThe Lunar Gateway space station is planned to be deployed in a highly elliptical seven-day near-rectilinear halo orbit (NRHO) around the Moon.Spacecraft launched from Earth would perform a powered flyby of the Moon followed by a NRHO orbit insertion burn to dock with the Gateway as it approaches the apoapsis point of its orbit.InterplanetaryThe spacecraft is assumed to be using chemical propulsion and the Oberth effect.According to Marsden and Ross, 'The energy levels of the Sun–Earthandpoints differ from those of the Earth–Moon system by only 50 m/s (as measured by maneuver velocity).'We may apply the formula(where μ = GM is the standard gravitational parameter of the sun, see Hohmann transfer orbit) to calculate the Δv in km/s needed to arrive at various destinations from Earth (assuming circular orbits for the planets, and using perihelion distance for Pluto). In this table, the column labeled 'Δv to enter Hohmann orbit from Earth's orbit' gives the change from Earth's velocity to the velocity needed to get on a Hohmann ellipse whose other end will be at the desired distance from the sun. The column labeled 'v exiting LEO' gives the velocity needed (in a non-rotating frame of reference centred on Earth) when 300 km above Earth's surface. This is obtained by adding to the specific kinetic energy the square of the speed (7.73 km/s) of this low Earth orbit (that is, the depth of Earth's gravity well at this LEO). The column 'Δv from LEO' is simply the previous speed minus 7.73 km/s. The transit time is calculated asyears.Note that the values in the table only give the Δv needed to get to the orbital distance of the planet. The speed relative to the planet will still be considerable, and in order to go into orbit around the planet either aerocapture is needed using the planet's atmosphere, or more Δv is needed.The New Horizons space probe to Pluto achieved a near-Earth speed of over 16 km/s which was enough to escape from the sun. (It also got a boost from a fly-by of Jupiter.)To get to the sun, it is actually not necessary to use a Δv of 24 km/s. One can use 8.8 km/s to go very far away from the sun, then use a negligible Δv to bring the angular momentum to zero, and then fall into the sun. This can be considered a sequence of two Hohmann transfers, one up and one down. Also, the table does not give the values that would apply when using the moon for a gravity assist. There are also possibilities of using one planet, like Venus which is the easiest to get to, to assist getting to other planets or the sun. The Galileo spacecraft used Venus once and Earth twice in order to reach Jupiter. The Ulysses solar probe used Jupiter to attain polar orbit around the sun.Delta-vs between Earth, Moon and MarsDelta-v needed for various orbital manoeuvers using conventional rockets. Gives figures of 8.6 from Earth's surface to LEO, 4.1 and 3.8 for LEO to lunar orbit (or L5) and GEO resp., 0.7 for L5 to lunar orbit, and 2.2 for lunar orbit to lunar surface.

Lower-delta-v transfers than shown can often be achieved, but involve rare transfer windows or take significantly longer, see: fuzzy orbital transfers.Electric propulsion vehicles going from Mars C3 = 0 to Earth C3 = 0 without using the Oberth effect need a larger Delta-v of between 2.6 km/s and 3.15 km/s. Not all possible links are shown.The Delta-v for C3 = 0 to Mars transfer must be applied at pericentre, i.e. immediately after accelerating to the escape trajectory, and do not agree with the formula above which gives 0.4 from Earth escape and 0.65 from Mars escape.The figures for LEO to GTO, GTO to GEO, and LEO to GEO are inconsistent. The figure of 30 for LEO to the sun is also too high.Near-Earth objectsNear-Earth objects are asteroids whose orbits can bring them within about 0.3 astronomical units of the Earth.There are thousands of such objects that are easier to reach than the Moon or Mars.Their one-way delta-v budgets from LEO range upwards from , which is less than 2/3 of the delta-v needed to reach the Moon's surface. But NEOs with low delta-v budgets have long synodic periods, and the intervals between times of closest approach to the Earth (and thus most efficient missions) can be decades long.The delta-v required to return from Near-Earth objects is usually quite small, sometimes as low as , with aerocapture using Earth's atmosphere. However, heat shields are required for this, which add mass and constrain spacecraft geometry. The orbital phasing can be problematic; once rendezvous has been achieved, low delta-v return windows can be fairly far apart (more than a year, often many years), depending on the body.In general, bodies that are much further away or closer to the sun than Earth, have more frequent windows for travel, but usually require larger delta-vs.See alsoBi-elliptic transfer Gravity assist Hohmann transfer Oberth effect Orbital speed Tsiolkovsky rocket equation Pork-chop plot Synodic periodNotesReferencesExternal links JavaScript Delta V calculator Decorative Delta-V Map Atomic Rockets - What's The Mission? Long webpage on delta-v (not a source - it quotes this article)Astrodynamics Spacecraft propulsion", "machine_text": " Delta-v budget is an aerospace engineering term that is used to describe the total delta-v (i.e. change in velocity) available for a spacecraft, satellite, or other vehicle over a period of time. It is calculated as the portion of delta-v available for imperative needs, such as propulsion, entry and de-orbit, maneuvers, station-keeping and attitude control. As such, it is an essential parameter in mission design and operations, particularly for short-duration missions such as launches, rendezvous and satellite positioning, which require precise timing and fuel management. Delta-v is defined as the total change in velocity (speed and direction) of a craft or object throughout a mission. The amount of velocity change achieved by a craft or satellite during a mission depends on the engines or thrusters used and the nature of the mission. For example, a low-thrust mission may require larger overall delta-v changes than a higher-thrust mission. The delta-v budget is used to limit the overall amount of fuel expended and required propellant resources during a mission. The development of the delta-v budget determines the trajectory the vehicle will take, which includes direction and the duration of the mission. A Delta-v budget is often constructed by breaking down the mission into a series of phases and sub-phases. Each of these components is then assigned a specific delta-v amount that is contingent upon the requirements of that phase or sub-phase. All of these individual delta-v components then add up to the total delta-v budget. The delta-v budget is used in conjunction with trajectory optimization methodologies to determine the optimal trajectory around a specific object, such as the Moon or Mars. The delta-v budget should identify the total delta-v that must be performed to achieve the desired mission objectives. By comparing vehicle capabilities to the planned requirements, off-design conditions may be detected and alternative mission plans may be suggested. For Earth-launched missions, the delta-v budget must typically include the total velocity required for a launch to a safe insertion into an orbit around the Earth (escape velocity). It must also include the velocity required for any midcourse corrections. Additionally, delta-v is required to change from a circular to an elliptical orbit, adjust the size of a circular orbit and provide additional maneuvering including plane shifts and apogee or perigee transfers. For deep space missions, delta-v budgets must include the total velocity required to overcome Earth's gravitational pull, as well as provide adequate amounts of acceleration or deceleration to enter the target orbit at the correct time, position, and speed. Delta-v budgets have many applications in the planning of missions. They allow mission planners to decide mission objectives, determine mission duration and determine required propellant resources. They can also be used to find the most efficient route to the target and maximize vehicle capabilities. Delta-v budgets provide an invaluable tool in mission design and operations.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 931880}

Caps range fromin diameter. The flesh is thin and white, with a mild taste and without a strong smell. Stems are cylindrical, white in color, often curved or bent, and aboutlong andin diameter. The gills are white, closely spaced, and run down the stem. The spores of the golden oyster mushroom are cylindrical or elliptical in shape, smooth, hyaline, amyloid, and measure 6-9 by 2–3.5 micrometres.Ecology The golden oyster mushroom, like other species of oyster mushroom, is a wood-decay fungus.In the wild, P. citrinopileatus most commonly decays hardwoods such as elm.Spores are spread by the beetle Callipogon relictus. The first official sightings of naturalized golden oysters in the United States appeared around 2012, perhaps a decade after the cultivation of the species began in North America, and they have been found growing on oak, elm, beech, and other hardwoods. Naturalized golden oysters have been found in many states including: Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Their vigorous range expansion is comparable to invasive species. Wild samples and two of the commercial isolates examined showed very high genetic similarity, alluding to potential source strains of wild populations.Uses Golden oyster mushrooms are cultivated commercially, usually on a medium of grain, straw, or sawdust.Pleurotus species are some of the most commonly cultivated mushrooms, particularly in China, due to their ease of cultivation and their ability to convert 100 g of organic refuse into 50-70 g of fresh mushrooms.ChemistryPleurotus citrinopileatus mushrooms are a source of antioxidants.Extracts from P. citrinopileatus have been studied for their antihyperglycemic properties, decreasing blood sugar levels in diabetic rats.They have also been studied as a source of lipid-lowering drugs; P. ostreatus, a related oyster mushroom, has been found to contain the cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin.In one study, among 11 other commonly cultivated or foraged mushroom species, Pleurotus citrinopileatus contained the second highest amount of the antioxidant and amino acid ergothionine at 3.94mg per gramm of dry weight, and fourth highest in glutathione at 1.39mg per gramm of dry weight. Both compounds had their highest concentrations in the pileus tissue. It had the highest amount of ergothionine among the other saprotrophs within the group.See also List of Pleurotus speciesReferencesExternal linksPleurotus citrinopileatus at Mushroom Observer'Pleurotus citrinopileatus' at iNaturalistPleurotaceae Fungi described in 1943 Fungi of Asia Fungi of China Fungi in cultivation Edible fungi Carnivorous fungi", "machine_text": " Pleurotus citrinopileatus is a species of saprobic, edible mushroom in the family Pleurotaceae. It has a widespread distribution and is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions of the world on both dead wood and living trees in tropical and subtropical forests. The species was first described in 1871 by Italian mycologist Carlo Vittadini. The mushroom has a white to yellowish-brown conical cap with a strongly umber zone at the circumference, sometimes with concentric bands. The gills are decurrent, wide and thin, and pale yellowish-fawn in colour. The stipe is up to 10 cm long and 3 cm thick, equal in width throughout its length, and generally twisted near the base. The stipes of immature specimens are often hollow. The mushroom has a pleasant smell that has been described as being similar to anise. Also known as 'Blue Oyster Mushroom'. The mushroom is widely appreciated as a culinary delicacy and is harvested for commercial production throughout its natural range. It is easily cultivated on dead wood or logs and can also be grown on sawdust, straw or cereal grain substrates. Preparation of the edible fruit bodies varies according to the requirements of the recipe and can involve boiling, steaming, frying, or grilling. It is particularly prized in India and Southeast Asia as an addition to soups, stews, and curries. Pleurotus citrinopileatus has long been studied for its therapeutic properties, including anti-inflammatory effects and the ability to protect against oxidative damage. These health benefits are likely due to the mushrooms’ high levels of various antioxidants, such as polyphenols and flavonoids. The warm flavonoid content of the Pleurotus citrinopileatus may also have anti-cancer properties, although further research is needed to confirm this. In Chinese medicine, the active constituents in the mushroom are believed to be beneficial to the respiratory system, improving circulation and calming the nerves. In conclusion, Pleurotus citrinopileatus is an edible and therapeutic mushroom with a widespread distribution and a wide range of beneficial compounds. It is a much-loved delicacy in many parts of the world and is capable of being cultivated for commercial production. This species has various therapeutic properties that are being explored further as research continues.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 31114557}

Toio was developed as part of Sony's CiL Project, a research initiative intended to combine elements of computers, robots, and multimedia in a single product. Initially, the project created a concept model of a robotic cat and a robotic ball which was first shown at an expo in 1997. After two years of development and testing, Sony released the Toio toy in Japan on May 19th, 2000. The Toio robot is a red and white wheeled robot that stands about 20 cm tall, with a single wheel at the center of its body, and two side arms for grasping objects. The robot is equipped with two light sensors and two electric eyes, a microphone, an audible speaker and infrared remote control capabilities. Via an infrared communication interface, the robot can receive commands from up to 25m away. Its electric motor can move it up to 60 cm/s and includes a number of levels of speed control. Toio is equipped with a number of programming commands, allowing users to customize its movements and behaviors. Toio also includes a feature called the Motion Operating System (MOS) which allows users to upload and share programmable codes that they have written. This enables users to allow others to access their programs, allowing them to customize the behavior of Toio beyond the native commands that come with the robot. The Toio robot was well-received upon its initial release, but Sony discontinued production of the product in 2003 due to production and technical difficulties. Consequently, the robot is relatively rare and only found used in auctions or hobbyist sites.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Mere (weapon)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The mere () is a type of short, broad-bladed weapon in the shape of an enlarged tear drop. It was used to strike/jab an opponent in the body or the head, usually made from nephrite jade (pounamu or greenstone). A mere is one of the traditional, hand to hand, one-handed weapons of the indigenous Māori of New Zealand, and a symbol of chieftainship.FormThe mere is a spatulate, leaf shaped, form of short club.It has a broad, rounded apex that narrows to form a handle, terminating in a butt or heel (reke), marked by several grooves.Mere have two convex, almost flat sides and a rounded top.The top of the mere was ground to a sharp edge, extending down both sides of the weapon.Generally, short clubs had holes carved or drilled through the butt end of the handle, allowing a wrist cord (tau or patui) made of plaited New Zealand flax, or Polynesian dog skin, to be passed through and attached to the wielder's wrist.Passing the wrist cord over the thumb and around the hand prevented the club from slipping during use.Mere are between , with an average length of .The width of a mere is similarly variable, from under 7 to over 12 centimetres (3 to 5 in).The dimensions of a mere were generally determined by the characteristics of the raw materials the club was made from.Extremely long or short mere are unwieldy in combat, and are likely to have been mainly used for ceremonial purposes.Material and manufactureWhile the term mere was, and is, used in some regions to refer exclusively to clubs made from pounamu, in other regions,mere was more broadly used to refer to patu of a similar shape and design made from hardwood (meremere, mere rakau), whalebone (patu paraoa), or stone (patu ōnewa) - in these areas, a mere made from greenstone was known as a mere pounamu or patu pounamu.The pounamu used to make a mere was carefully chosen to be flawless and to have a good colour.A block of greenstone was first rough cut using pieces of quartzite combined with sand and water.Dressing of the surface was done with fine sandstone and pieces of very hard smooth stone.Due to the toughness of greenstone, mere pounamu were able to be made thinner than other similar patu made from stone, however this made the process of manufacture slow and arduous. The creation and finishing of a mere pounamu is claimed to have sometimes taken more than one generation to complete.UsageCombatMere, and other patu, were used for close-quarter fighting.Held in one hand, these close-range striking weapons were used primarily for end-on thrusting or jabbing (tipi).In combat, jabbing thrusts or strikes would be directed at the ribs, neck or temple.It has been claimed that a strike to the skull combined with a twisting flick of the wrist could force or wrench the victim's skull open. The designed use of the mere for forward striking thrusts is an unusual characteristic of Maori patu, where in other parts of the world, clubs are generally wielded with an ax-like downward blow. The butt (reke) of a mere could also be used to strike an opponent's head.A mere pounamu was much harder than a patu of wood or bone, and much tougher - less likely to fracture - than a patu onawe of any other type of stone.It was stated that a proficient warrior armed with a patu was able to defeat a man armed with a longer weapon, like a taiaha or spear.A fighter using a patu often used a type of pad (whakapuru), held or on the off-side arm, used to parry or lessen the impact of an opposing weapon.When not in use mere were carried in a flax belt (tātua) or sometimes suspended from a wrist cord.CeremonialPounamu was highly prized by Maori and the mere pounamu as the weapon of a chief or rangatira, was the most revered of all Maori weapons.These mere were passed through generations; they were given names, and were said to possess a spiritual quality or mana of their own.Particularly special mere were imbued with magical powers, or supernatural qualities. Due to the high value placed on revered mere pounamu they would often be hidden when not in use, and kept in specially constructed cases.Considerable efforts were undertaken, often by an entire tribe, to recover or regain significant mere that were lost or stolen. Mere were buried with their chiefly owners, but were considered so valuable that they were later recovered from the grave during the second burial.It was considered an honour to be killed by a specially significant mere pounamu.Captives would sometimes volunteer their own mere pounamu as their means of execution rather than be killed by a lesser weapon.Giving such a valuable itemwas common as a sign of good faith and it retains this symbolic importance today.The mere is shown as one of the features of the Maori Kotahitanga flag, where it is crossed with a scroll representing the Treaty of Waitangi.See also Kotiate Pouwhenua Tewhatewha Patu Taiaha Leiomano WahaikaReferencesExternal links'Horokiwi' - the mere of Te Rira Pōrutu'Hine-nui-o-te-paua' - gifted by the Ngāti Pāoato Governor George Grey as a peace offering in 1851'Tuhiwai' - Te Rauparaha's personal weapon.Extensive collection at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa TongarewaCollection at the British MuseumClubs (weapon) Māori weapons Ceremonial weapons", "machine_text": " Mere is a weapon that originated in New Zealand during the mid 19th century. It consists of a wooden club approximately a meter in length and is traditionally carved from New Zealand native hardwoods. It has been described as a heavy club, which has been compared to a baseball bat. The mere originated among the Māori people as part of their traditional weapons, and for use in tribal warfare. It is believed to have been used for close-range combat with other Māori warriors. Mere are usually inscribed with manaia (spirits) or abstract designs as symbols of power, although in ritual combat these designs were often mere decorative scrolls. In recent years, Mere has become a popular item among collectors as a symbol of Māori cultural heritage in New Zealand. The Mere is considered to be a versatile and powerful weapon. It can be used as a slashing device as well as a striking weapon. With the use of its edges, Mere is capable of delegating considerable force. Some argue that mere are stronger than a spear and was wielded in one hand. Other Māori weapons included the Taiaha, Patu, and Rākau, which were all used as resources for hand to hand combat, especially in tribal wars. Taiaha, a light weight spear, was mainly used for melee situations while Patu (clubs) and Rākau (wooden weapons) were better suited for long range fights. The Māori swords were somewhat lacking in comparison to those used by other nations, due to the lack of exotic materials available. Since Mere were mainly used for Māori ritual combat, Māori warriors typically employed the weapon in non lethal manner. The opponent could surrender before death or serious injury was inflicted. It was considered a great show of courage to wage battle with Mere, as a true Māori warrior risked his own life as well as killing the opponent. Today, Mere are still widely used by Māori cultural groups across New Zealand in the performance of traditional combat rituals, such as the formal Haka dance. The mere is also used as a symbol of power and identity, being present in traditional ceremonies and in popular culture. Mere have become popular tourist attractions in New Zealand, both as souvenirs and in public demonstrations of traditional Māori culture. The sheer power of Mere has made it an attractive option for martial artists and weapons enthusiasts seeking to acquire a symbol of Māori culture for use in martial arts and self-defense.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1708129}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Monteregian Hills\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Monteregian Hills () is a linear chain of isolated hills in Montreal and Montérégie, between the Laurentians and the Appalachians.Etymology The first definition of the Monteregian Hills came about in 1903 when Montreal geologist Frank Dawson Adams began referring to Mount Royal (Latin, Mons Regius) and hills of similar geology in the Saint Lawrence Lowlands as the 'Royal Mountains' (). Other hills in the chain included Mont Saint-Bruno, Mont Saint-Hilaire, Mont Saint-Grégoire, Mont Rougemont, Mont Yamaska, Mont Shefford, and Mont Brome.It was only later that Mont Mégantic, the Oka Hills, as well as the Saint-André and d'Iberville formations, were added to the list.Geology Each hill in the chain consists of an erosional remnant of Cretaceous intrusive igneous rock and associated hornfels, which are more resistant to weathering than the surrounding sedimentary rock. All of the hills have dark-coloured mafic rock such as gabbro and essexite; some also have large areas of pulaskite, syenite, and other light-coloured rock.The Monteregian Hills are part of the Great Meteor hotspot track, formed as a result of the North American Plate sliding westward over the long-lived New England hotspot, and are the eroded remnants of intrusive stocks. These intrusive stocks have been variously interpreted as the feeder intrusions of long extinct volcanoes, which would have been active about 125 million years ago, or as intrusives that never breached the surface in volcanic activity. The lack of an obvious track west of the Monteregian Hills may be due either to failure of the plume to penetrate the Canadian Shield, to the lack of recognizable intrusions, or to strengthening of the plume when it approached the Monteregian Hills region. However, there is evidence the hotspot track extends northwestwards, including epeirogenic uplift, mantle velocity anomalies and kimberlitic volcanic features (e.g. the Attawapiskat, Kirkland Lake and Lake Timiskaming kimberlite fields) that become older away from the Monteregian Hills.The shallow, rocky sandy loam soils of the summits are mostly covered in forest. Where the underlying rock is rich in olivine, as over large areas of Mont Saint-Bruno and Mont Rougemont, these soils are classed as dystric brunisol. Podzol tends to develop over rock which lacks olivine, although many of these podzols lack an eluvial (Ae) horizon. Lower slopes are covered with aprons of gravel or sand. The sandy soils are usually podzols with classic Ae development; they often have subsoil hardpan and are undesirable for agriculture. The free-draining gravels are preferred for apple orchards, which grow in thermal belts where cold air can drain to the valley floor.GallerySee also Volcanism of Canada Volcanism of Eastern CanadaExternal linksLes collines montérégiennes Geologic information about the chainReferencesMountain ranges of Quebec Mountains of Quebec Cretaceous volcanism Igneous petrology of Quebec Landforms of Montérégie", "machine_text": " The Monteregian Hills are located in the Montreal metropolitan area in southern Quebec, Canada. The Monteregian Hills are part of a network of isolated hills that form part of the Appalachian Mountains chain, extending from Maine to Alabama in the United States. The name “Monteregian” is derived from the local populace in the region who commonly referred to the area as “Haut-Montréal” (High Montreal) in the eighteenth century. It was initially used in the nineteenth century to refer to a district within the City of Montreal but gradually came to mean the hilly area surrounding the city. The Monteregian Hills comprise several distinct mountains in the region. These are Mont Royal, Mount Saint-Bruno, Shefford Mountain, Mont Yamaska, Mont Saint-Hilaire, Mont Saint-Grégoire and Mont Rougemont. Each of these mountains rises several hundred feet above the surrounding city, with Mont Royal and Mount Saint-Bruno reaching heights of over 1,000 feet above sea level. These mountains are composed primarily of limestone, shale, sandstone and basalt. They form part of the Notre Dame Mountains and form the western limit of the St. Lawrence Lowlands. The hilly terrain has resulted in the formation of a number of deep valleys and inter-valley ridges throughout the region, giving the hills their characteristic aspect. Apart from providing a picturesque backdrop to the City of Montreal and its surrounding towns, these hills also offer numerous recreational opportunities. Ski-dooing and snowshoeing are popular winter activities on Mont Royal and Mount Saint-Bruno, while summer months bring hiking, climbing and the annual Monteregian Hills Race. The Mont Saint-Hilaire Biosphere Reserve and numerous nature trails, such as the Mount Odanah Trail, provide ample opportunities for nature lovers to explore the natural beauty of the hills. The Monteregian Hills form an important part of the geography of Montreal and its surrounding area. They have become increasingly popular as destination of recreational pursuits in recent years, while providing a much-needed refuge from the hustle and bustle of city life.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1746067}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Nguyễn Trãi\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Nguyễn Trãi (阮廌), pen name Ức Trai (抑齋); (1380–1442) was an illustrious Vietnamese Confucian scholar, a noted poet, a skilled politician and a master strategist. He was at times attributed with being capable of almost miraculous or mythical deeds in his designated capacity as a close friend and principal advisor of Lê Lợi, Vietnam's hero-emperor, who fought to free the country from Chinese rule. He is credited with writing the important political statements of Lê Lợi and inspiring the Vietnamese populace to support open rebellion against the Ming Dynasty rulers. He is also the author of 'Great Proclamation upon the Pacification of the Wu' (Bình Ngô đại cáo).BiographyEarly life Nguyễn Trãi originally was from Hải Dương Province, he was born in 1380 in Thăng Long (present day Hanoi), the capital of the declining Trần Dynasty.Under the brief Hồ Dynasty, he passed examination and served for a time in the government.In 1406, Ming forces invaded and conquered Vietnam.Under the occupation, the Ming China attempted to convert Vietnam into a Chinese province and ruthlessly quashed all rebellions.War of independenceIn 1417, Nguyễn Trãi joined a rebel leader named Lê Lợi, who was resisting the occupation from a mountainous region in Thanh Hóa Province south of Hanoi.Nguyễn Trãi served as the chief advisor, strategist and propagandist for the movement.The war of independence leading to the defeat of the Ming and the inauguration of the Lê Dynasty lasted from 1417 to 1427.From 1417 until 1423, Lê Lợi conducted a classic guerilla campaign from his bases in the mountains.Following a negotiated truce, Lê Lợi, following the advice of Nguyễn Chích, led his army to the southern prefecture of Nghệ An. From Nghệ An, Vietnamese forces won many battles and gained control over the whole part of Vietnam from Thanh Hóa southwards. The Ming sent a series of military reinforcements in response to bolster their positions.In 1426, the army of a Chinese general named Wang Tong arrived in the Red River Delta.However, Vietnamese forces were able to cut supply lines and control the countryside, leaving Chinese presence totally isolated in the capital and other citadels.During this period, Nguyễn Trãi sought to undermine the resolve of the enemy and to negotiate a favorable peace by sending a series of missives to the Ming commanders. In 1427 the Ming emperor Xuande sent two large reinforcing armies to Vietnam. Lê Lợi moved his forces to the frontier, where they confronted and utterly defeated Chinese reinforcements in a series of bloody battles, most notably the battle of Chi Lăng-Xương Giang. Wang Tong sued for peace.The numerous Chinese prisoners of war were all given provisions and allowed to return to China.Nguyễn Trãi penned a famous proclamation of victory.Later life After the war Nguyễn Trãi was elevated by Lê Lợi to an exalted position in the new court but internal intrigues, sycophantic machinations and clannish nepotism meant he was not appointed regent upon the emperor's death. Instead that position was bestowed upon Lê Sát, who ruled as regent on behalf of the young heir Lê Thái Tông.At some point during the regency of Lê Sát, having found life at court increasingly difficult, Nguyễn Trãi retired to his country home north of Hanoi in the tranquil mountains of Chí Linh, where he enjoyed poetry writing and meditation. Today, visitors can visit this site where a large shrine of remembrance, covering from the foot of the mountain to the top is erected to honour the national hero. The site of Nguyễn Trãi's house still exists, however only the tiled floors remain original. Close by is an ancient Buddhist temple, which has stood there several centuries before his time.DeathNguyễn Trãi'sdeath resulted from a scandal involving the young emperor, Lê Thái Tông, and the wife or concubine of Nguyễn Trãi, named Nguyễn Thị Lộ. Early in 1442, the young emperor began an affair with Nguyễn Thị Lộ. This affair continued when the emperor visited the old scholar at his home. Not long after having left, Lê Thái Tông suddenly became ill and died. The nobles at the court blamed Nguyễn Thị Lộ for the young emperor's death, accused them of regicide and had both, along with most members of their extended families, executed.Twenty years later, Lê Thái Tông's son, emperor Lê Thánh Tông officially pardoned Nguyễn Trãi, saying that he was wholly innocent in the death of Thánh Tông's father. He was given the posthumous noble title the Count of Tán TrùLegacyAccording to Loren Baritz ('Backfire: A History of How American Culture Led Us Into Vietnam and Made Us Fight the Way We Did', 1985), Trai set down the Vietnamese strategy against the Chinese in an essay.This essay would prove to be very close to the Communists' strategy of insurgency.Specifically you must, 'subordinate military action to the political and moral struggle...better to conquer hearts than citadels.'Most cities in Vietnam have named major streets after him.Family Nguyễn Trãi had 5 wives (or concubines) and 7 sons.Wive/Concubines:• Lady Phạm Đỗ Minh Hiển• Lady Phùng Thành• Lady Nguyễn Thị Lộ• Lady Phạm Thị Mẫn• Lady Trần Anh MinhSons:• Nguyễn Khuê (Lady Trần's)• Nguyễn Ứng (Lady Trần's)• Nguyễn Phù (Lady Trần's)• Nguyễn Bảng (Lady Phùng's)• Nguyễn Tích (Lady Phùng's)• Nguyễn Anh Vũ (Lady Phạm's)• Forefather of a Nguyễn family's branch in Quế Lĩnh, Phương Quất, Kinh Môn District, Hải Dương Province. (Lady Lê's)Notable descendants:• Nguyễn Thiện Thuật• Nguyễn Văn CừWorkBeing both a military tactician and a poet, Nguyễn Trãi's works varied in many areas ranging from literature, history, geography, ceremony and propriety; many of them were missing after his execution. Most of his poems that survive until today were collected in Ức Trai Thi Tập (Ức Trai's Poems Collection) by Dương Bá Cung, printed in 1868 under Nguyễn Dynasty. His poems, written in both ancient Chinese (Hán) and Vietnamese (Nôm), were highly regarded by notable philosophers, poets, and politicians in Vietnamese history.In 2010, Vietnamese poet Nguyễn Đỗ and American poet Paul Hoover published the first collection of Nguyễn Trãi's poetry in English translation, titled Beyond the Court Gate: Selected Poems. The collection reflects Nguyễn Trãi's metaphysical contemplation of tiny details in everyday life, but at the same time set him apart from Li Po's uses of extreme imaginary and formal poetic rules. Nguyễn Trãi's poems demonstrate wit, humility, and a conversational tone, and express his personal perception and experience.An example of Nguyễn Trãi's writing is his poem To a Friend (Traditional Chinese: 記友, Sino-Vietnamese: Kí Hữu, Vietnamese: Gửi Bạn), as translated and edited by Nguyễn Đỗ and Paul Hoover:記友半生世路嘆屯邅，萬事惟應付老天。寸舌但存空自信，一寒如故亦堪憐。光陰焂忽時難再，客舍凄涼夜似年。十載讀書貧到骨，盤惟苜蓿坐無氈。To a Friend My fate naturally has many twists and sharp turns,So in everything I trust in the wisdom of Heaven.I still have my tongue—believe me, I am able to talk,Even though I’m still poor and, as we know, pathetic.Never to return, the past flies too quickly and the time is short,But, wandering in this cold room, the night is far too long.I’ve been reading books for ten years, but I’m poor from clothes to boneFrom eating only vegetables and sitting without a cushion.ReferencesBeyond the Court Gate”.

He was an influential and respected figure in Vietnamese history and is considered one of the four most renowned poets in Vietnam along with Nguyễn Du, Lê Quý Đôn, and Hồ Xuân Hương. Nguyễn Trãi was born into a scholarly family in Hải Dương Province. After studying Confucian classics, Trãi was selected by Emperor Lê of Vietnam to serve as the chief minister of the Le court. He then became the highest ranking scholar-official in the Lê Dynasty. During his tenure in the court, Trãi vigorously promoted Confucianism as the state religion and encouraged the study of classical Chinese literature, argumentation, and martial arts. Trãi is credited with a number of important works in Vietnamese literature. His poetry often focused on the beauty of nature and the strength of patriotism, which made him a popular figure among the Vietnamese people. Trãi was also the author of 'Preface to the Three Treatises on Imperial Examination,' the first major treatise on imperial examination in Vietnam. The treatise provides a comprehensive overview of the imperial examination procedure and includes advice and strategies for success in the exams. Apart from his literary works, Trãi is well known for his roles in numerous political events, such as the resistance against Ming dynasty invasions of Vietnam. In 1427, he organized a revolt against the Ming forces which eventually led to the successful defense of Vietnam and ushered in the beginning of its independence. He also made important contributions to furthering the cause of Vietnamese independence from Chinese sovereignty. Nguyễn Trãi died in 1442 and is widely regarded as one of the most important figures in Vietnamese history. He is commemorated in Vietnam for his service to the country and his tireless efforts to promote the scholarships of history, poetry and philosophy.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"ADAPT Act\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Antibiotic Development to Advance Patient Treatment (ADAPT) Act () was introduced in the U.S. Congress on December 12, 2013 by Representative Phil Gingrey of Georgia and fifty-two cosponsors. Responding to the lack of financial incentives for drug manufacturers to innovate new antibiotics and antifungals and the regulatory barriers to their doing so, it proposed an expedited pathway for testing drugs intended for diseases for which no cure yet existed. After it died in committee, a similar version of the Act was re-introduced by Representative John Shimkus of Illinois and his cosponsor Representative Gene Green of Texas. Though this Act likewise failed to make it out of committee, several of its provisions were codified in the 21st Century Cures Act, which was signed into law on December 13, 2016. These include the expedited testing pathway for new antibiotics and a similar provision for antimicrobial susceptibility tests.BackgroundAntibiotic resistance and the barriers to new treatments The cost of antibiotic resistance, in dollars and in lives, motivated the Act’s sponsors and the community stakeholders that supported its passage. In September 2014, the Subcommittee on Health of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce held a hearing at which officials from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Pew Charitable Trusts, and other organizations testified in favor of the ADAPT and 21st Century Cures Acts. Opening the hearing, Subcommittee Chairman Joseph R. Pitts (R-PA) quoted then-Prime Minister David Cameron’s recent admonition that failure to “confront the threat of antibiotic resistance” could “cast [humanity] back into the dark ages.” Speaking at this same hearing, Representative Phil Gingrey (R-GA) (the 2013 Act’s principal sponsor) referenced Centers for Disease Control (CDC) statistics, which placed the number of Americans who die from drug-resistant infections each year at around 23,000. Representative Gingrey asserted that the financial losses from such infections amount to 55 billion annually. Representative John Shimkus (R-IL) would later note these same figures in a House debate over the Acts in July 2015.Equally worrisome to the ADAPT Act’s proponents were the economic and regulatory impediments to developing new treatments for drug-resistant illnesses. Citing the FDA, Representative Gingrey lamented during the 2014 hearing that “new antibiotic approval ha[d] decreased by 70 percent since the mid 1980s.” Representative Michael C. Burgess (R-TX) likewise took issue with the “lack of a pipeline of new drugs” to respond to the threat of super bugs. Several blamed inadequate market incentives for this paucity of remedies. As Dr. Barbara E. Murray, then-President of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, observed, “Antibiotics are typically priced low [and] used for a short duration.” Pharmaceutical companies can reap greater returns in other areas of research; hence, the development of new antibiotics flounders.Compounding the scant financial motives for drug development, creators of new treatments were made to contend with 'serious regulatory barriers'. Dr. Murray observed that the small number of patients infected by novel diseases made it difficult for manufacturers to find enough test subjects in order to comply with federal agencies’ n-count requirements. The unavailability of diagnostic tests for these new infectious agents also demanded a large investment to find eligible study participants, while generating little information about drug effectiveness. Stagnant innovation becomes self-perpetuating. The more antibiotics to which a pathogen becomes resistant, the fewer controls there are against which to measure an experimental treatment.The GAIN Act In 2012, one of Congress’s earliest attempts at rectifying these barriers to new drug-resistant antibiotics came in the form of the Generating Antibiotics Now (GAIN) Act. GAIN was passed as an amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FDC) Act. Its strategy for generating new antibiotics is to offer manufacturers an artificial monopoly on any qualifying drugs that they produce. Such drugs must treat illnesses with “the potential to pose a serious threat to the public health.” However, beyond this blanket criterion, GAIN gave significant deference to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (the Secretary). This latitude was subject only to the requirements that she consider a given pathogen’s “impact on public health” and “morbidity and mortality rates” and consult with the CDC, FDA, and the medical community. Manufacturers who satisfied GAIN’s conditions were guaranteed five years of market exclusivity over the pertinent drug. These years could stack with the drug’s “five year exclusivity as a new chemical entity (NCE), three year clinical investigation exclusivity, and seven-year orphan drug exclusivity.” Moreover, any qualifying drugs were eligible for fast-track review.GAIN’s value proposition proved to be an effective one. As Representative Frank Pallone (D-NJ) commented during the 2014 ADAPT Act hearing, within two years, GAIN had led to FDA approval of numerous new antibiotics. The expedited review procedure further ensured that these drugs would be “able to combat an imminent infectious disease threat and reach patients at an accelerated pace'. At the same time, Representative Pallone and others were concerned about the consumer harms that these decades of exclusivity might yield. Representative Henry A. Waxman (D-CA) warned that exclusivity “allow[s drug companies] to charge higher prices,” which “imposes a significant burden on patients and on the healthcare system overall.” To justify “the carrot of marketing and regulatory exclusivities,” Representative Pallone exhorted his fellow members of Congress to ensure that their efforts “achieve[] the necessary impact on the pipeline of new drugs.”ProvisionsPurpose and Scope The ADAPT Act complemented GAIN. Representative Gingrey introduced it to the House as the “logical next step to the GAIN Act.” To that end, it did not merely render the development of new treatments more lucrative but more feasible as well. The centerpiece of this proposal was ADAPT’s creation of a Limited Population Antibacterial Drug (LPAD) approval pathway for certain antibiotics. Faced with a disease of sufficient severity for which alternatives do not yet exist, ADAPT would empower the Secretary to dispense with the usual testing requirements and allow manufacturers to go to market based on more limited efficacy tests. As Allan Coukell, Director of Drug, Medical Device, and Food Programs at the Pew Charitable Trusts, observed, a patient with mutli-drug-resistant pneumonia will likely die without access to a new antibiotic. In that case, the uncertainty of an unproven remedy was preferable to the near certainty of death. In conducting such a risk-benefit assessment, ADAPT allowed the FDA to “accept less data” in approving a lifesaving drug. As Representative Shimkus later commended, this “new, streamlined pathway” saved “thousands of lives” by making experimental drugs available to those who would otherwise have no cure.Given the uncertainty inherent in drugs approved via LPAD, ADAPT’s advocates were careful to constrain its reach to “high-need populations” suffering from the gravest threats. Dr. Janet Woodcock, Director of the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, claimed that ADAPT would be restricted to “rare resistant organisms where there are really very few treatment options available.” Within the population of patients affected by these diseases, the Act’s application would be further constrained to “the limited population in most need of the therapy, as opposed to all patients.” As such, ADAPT would not lower the federal review standard for new drugs, but merely contour it to the needs of “a specific population that is different from the general population.”Relationship Between the 2013 and 2015 Acts The two versions of the ADAPT Act—H.R. 3742 (2013) and H.R. 2629 (2015)—contain the same three overriding provisions discussed above. Both would amend Section 505 of FDC (21 U.S.C. § 355) to formally include the expedited testing pathway. Each prescribes certain labeling requirements for manufacturers and charges the Secretary of Health and Human Services with conducting the aforementioned breakpoint review. Under a modification to Title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. § 247b-22), the Secretary is also to monitor “the use of antibacterial and antifungal drugs” as well as “[c]hanges in bacterial and fungal resistance to drugs.” This new responsibility of the Secretary encompasses drugs approved both through LPAD as well as the standard procedure. The results of the Secretary’s resistance analysis, like the breakpoint research, are to be made public.The 2013 and 2015 Acts differed slightly in scope and the precise process they envisioned. Under the 2013 Act, the Secretary could approve drugs to treat “a limited population of patients for which there is an unmet need,” based on her assessment of either traditional comprehensive studies, “datasets of limited size,” “such other confirmatory evidence as [she] deems necessary,” or some combination of the above. The 2015 version expands this list of sources of proof, holding that the Secretary may consult nonclinical tests—assessments not conducted on humans—in deciding on whether to approve a drug.At the same time, this later version limited the Act’s applicability via a purpose statement with language evocative of a sliding scale. The Act serves to “help expedite the development and availability of treatments for serious or life-threatening bacterial or fungal infections,” but this goal depends on “the severity of the infection and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.” Furthermore, the 2015 Act contained a new precondition. In this version of the legislation, the Secretary did not simply decide what level of proof would be necessary for a drug’s approval but actively collaborated with the manufacturer to create a “written agreement” that stipulated the necessary evidence. Only if such an agreement is reached may the Secretary approve the drug via the LPAD pathway. To the end of reaching this agreement, the 2015 Act provides for consultative meetings between manufacturers and the Secretary.In regard to labeling, the 2013 Act would have mandated that LPAD drugs bear the warning label noted above: “This drug is indicated for use in a limited and specific population of patients.” However, on its terms, this requirement applied only to the drug’s “prescribing information”—not necessarily to its packaging or bottle. The 2015 Act broadened the labeling provision. In addition to the warning on prescriptions, this version entailed placing a label on the product itself that states “Limited Population” and features “in a prominent manner . . . adjacent to . . . the brand name of the product.”Finally, the 2015 version of the Act expanded its applicability relative to the prior version. For one, it allowed the Secretary to expand LPAD to new arenas outside its original superbug context. Should she determine “that the public health would benefit from expansion of the limited-use pathway,” other medical areas may be subsumed within the Act’s expedited provisions. Secondly, it pulls antimicrobial susceptibility tests into the LPAD pathway. So long as a given test satisfies the exigency conditions for antimicrobial drug treatments, “the Secretary may authorize the marketing of such device” under LPAD—subject to cautionary labeling requirements.LimitationsKevin Khachatryan noted, that the ADAPT Act did not impose responsibilities for Antimicrobial stewardship for antibiotics developed under this pathway.” Coupled with the incentive for manufacturers to produce all that they can during their monopoly window, “[t]his can lead to overuse of these antibiotics and contribute to resistant microbes.” Additionally, the Act placed a premium of speed while sidelining other objectives of testing, namely diverse representation among test subjects. This could impede the gathering of data about certain populations respond to experimental drugs, namely “women, children, and [the] elderly.”Incorporation into the 21st Century Cures ActThe day Representative Gingrey and fifty-two cosponsors introduced the ADAPT Act, it was referred to the Subcommittee on Health. It never left. A little over a year later, Representative Shimkus, joined by cosponsor Gene Green (D-TX), resuscitated the Act. Again, it died in committee. Nevertheless, “[m]any of [its] provisions were ultimately incorporated into the 21st Century Cures Act [Cures Act].' A bipartisan effort ranging from such varied policy areas as Medicare savings to tick-borne diseases, the Cures Act was signed into law three years and a day after the ADAPT Act’s initial proposal.Section 3042 (concerning the “expedited testing of new antibacterial and antifungal drugs”) of the Cures Act derives nearly verbatim from the 2015 ADAPT Act. At the request of a drug manufacturer, the Secretary may approve a given medication based on substandard data—provided that it “is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening infection in a limited population of patients with unmet needs.” However, in the vein of the 2015 ADAPT Act’s purpose statement, Section 3042 requires the Secretary to balance the benefits of expedited remedies against their costs. Drugs approved under the Cures Act’s LPAD pathway are subject to much the same labeling requirements as under the ADAPT Act. All labeling and advertising associated with such medications “shall contain the statement ‘Limited Population’ in a prominent manner and adjacent to . . . the proprietary name of such drug.” Section 3044 underscores the Secretary’s ability to update and issue new susceptibility criteria for antimicrobial drugs and her requirement make this information public. Finally, Section 3043 includes similar language (relative to the 2015 ADAPT Act) in regard to the expedited production of new ASTs and their labeling requirements.ReferencesUnited States federal health legislation Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress Acts of the 114th United States Congress", "machine_text": " The ADAPT Act, also known as the Achieving Digital Accessibility for Person-Centered Technologies Act, is a bill introduced in the United States Congress in 2021 designed to ensure that people with disabilities have access to digital services and products. The bill was introduced by Congressman Jim Langevin from Rhode Island, with cosponsors John Larson from Connecticut, Ted Deutch from Florida, Don Young from Alaska, and Pete Visclosky from Indiana. The ADAPT Act does three major things: First, it requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to create consumer rights and consumer assistance resources. This includes setting up a website with easy to understand information about rights and assistance resources. It also requires HHS to appoint a Consumer Rights Advocate to serve as a point of contact for people with disabilities to address any accessibility issues they encounter when using digital products and services, like websites, mobile applications, and other technology. Second, the Act requires tech companies, medical providers, care providers, and other service providers to adhere to accessibility standards set out by the HHS. This includes developing accessible mobile apps and websites, and providing accessible version of products and services for people with disabilities. Third, the Act requires federal agencies to ensure that their own digital products and services follow accessibility standards. Federal agencies must also ensure that their contractors' products and services are accessible to people with disabilities. The ADAPT Act is an important step towards protecting people with disabilities and ensuring they have equal access to digital services and products. Ensuring that these services and products are accessible to people with disabilities will open up access to a range of opportunities, providing greater independence and success. The ADAPT Act marks a major step forward in protecting digital accessibility, and is a necessary part of creating a more equitable and inclusive digital future for everyone.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 46434889}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"The Phantom Freighter\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Phantom Freighter is Volume 26 in the original The Hardy Boys Mystery Stories published by GrossetDunlap.This book was written for the Stratemeyer Syndicate by Amy McFarlane, the wife of long time Hardy Boys author Leslie McFarlane, in 1947. Between 1959 and 1973 the first 38 volumes of this series were systematically revised as part of a project directed by Harriet Adams, Edward Stratemeyer's daughter. The original version of this book was shortened in 1970 by Priscilla Baker-Carr resulting in two similar stories sharing the same title.Plot summary The Hardy brothers embark on a freighter trip under mysterious circumstances and find themselves involved with a smuggling ring.The Hardy Boys discover that the Phantom Freighter is really a smuggling ship used to smuggle counterfeit documents, illegal drugs, cowhides, and electric motors.Aunt Gertrude's carton Enigmatic stranger Thaddeus McClintock arrives in Bayport and engages Frank and Joe Hardy to arrange for a relaxing trip for him (with the Boys to accompany him) with the mysterious promise of “I’ll pay all expenses and when the trip is over you’ll be paid. Money, if you like. Or something else.” Meanwhile, Aunt Gertrude has arrived and announced that she is going to be living in the Hardy household long term. The shipping company incorrectly delivers one of her cartons, delivering instead a box apparently of raw wool addressed to a Mr. Johnson to the Hardy’s address. After expressing her anger at the shipping company as the carton contains valuable family papers, Aunt Gertrude sends the boys to the address marked on the box to swap the packages. Arriving at the remote farm, the boys find nobody home but the barn ablaze. Frank breaks into the barn to rescue a carton believed to be Aunt Gertrude’s, only to find out it contained discarded newspapers. The owner of the barn arrives and is shocked to find that someone had been staying at his house and having packages delivered while he was out of town. After getting a description of the man who signed for the package from the delivery driver, the boys spot a man matching that description at a clothing store and follow him to the docks where he disappears.Going fishing Later, after reviewing several other modes of travel with Mr. McClintock, the boys suggest a cruise on an oceangoing freighter, to which Mr. McClintock is receptive. The boys then try repeatedly to book passage on freighters scheduled through Bayport, but are rebuffed at every turn. The travel agency they attempted to work through, owned by Mr. Klack, seems more interested in keeping them off ships than arranging their passage. Even when the boys are successful at obtaining tickets through an out-of-town travel agency, an unknown individual posing to act on their behalf picks up their tickets, again preventing them from setting sail. At the suggestion of loyal Hardy friend Chet Morton (who is trying his hand at fly-tying), the boys and Mr. McClintock employ local fishing captain Harkness to take them on a fishing expedition. Captain Harkness agrees to take the trip, provided they avoid Barmet Shoals as he recently spotted a phantom freighter there that left him spooked and shaken. After landing a monstrous tuna to the delight of Mr. McClintock and heading back to Bayport, their boat runs out of gas to the disbelief of Captain Harkness. As night falls, the party on the boat is horrified to see a freighter cutting through the sea toward them, only to go silent and dark. Though the boys try hard to locate the ship, it is neither heard or sighted again and has disappeared by first light. Rescue comes from a coastal patrol aircraft and ship the next day.Mysteries in Bayport Meanwhile, numerous other break-ins are discovered in and around Bayport during which nothing was stolen from unoccupied houses, but packages are delivered and signed for by people unknown to the owners. Fenton Hardy reveals that he is working on a case of forged historical documents which have been appearing in the rare document trade.Aunt Gertrude takes a trip to Bridgewater, evasively answering questions about where and why she is going. The boys follow her to Bridgewater and find her meeting with an elderly woman the boys previously identified as one of the people involved in the package delivery scheme.Taking a cruise The boys recruit their friend Biff Hooper to help them book passage, which turns to their advantage as an out-of-town travel agent arranges their cruise aboard the Father Neptune. Meeting Captain Gramwell of the Father Neptune, the boys learn that one crew member recently left the ship ill and a new hand had been hired. Suspicious, the boys investigate and find the crewman had in fact been kidnapped and the new hand was sent to interrupt the trip. Captain Gramwell reacts quickly and has the new crewman, recognized by the boys as part of the smuggling ring, arrested and questioned to find his missing crewman, who is recovered.Mr. McClintock, the boys, Biff, and Chet board the Father Neptune in Southport. At sea, the cargo aboard the Father Neptune suddenly shifts, leaving the ship listing badly and in danger of sinking. The crew and passengers rush to redistribute the cargo, eventually restoring the ship upright.The boys tell Captain Gramwell about the smuggling ring and phantom ship. Captain Gramwell has the ship’s radio operator contact all the ships in the area and discovers that the Lion Tamer spotted just such a ship nearby. Spotting the ship at nightfall, the Father Neptune pursues the mystery ship, identified as the Black Gull, but is unable to overtake it, much to the frustration of Captain Gramwell as the Father Neptune is declared to be the fastest ship in those waters and the mystery ship is obviously older and slower. That night, the mystery ship is again sighted, dark and apparently adrift. Along with the Father Nepture”'s radio operator Sparks, the boys row over to the ship while the Father Neptune keeps a spotlight on the mystery ship to hide the rowboat. This scene is depicted on the cover of the book. Upon boarding the mystery ship, the party finds the ship seemingly abandoned, but are suddenly jumped by the ship’s crew and captured.Captivity Held captive with Sparks aboard the Black Gull by the chief smuggler Crowfoot, the boys pretend to cast in with the smuggler. Crowfeet tells the boys about the ship’s secret repeller belts around the hull which hold off any motorized vessel or aircraft, allowing the Black Gull (under many different names) to escape from much faster ships and explaining how the boys adrift in the fishing boat were able to get so close with the fishing boat's engine shut down due to fuel exhaustion. After the Black Gull's radio operator falls ill, Crowfeet presses a seemingly reluctant Sparks into service to send messages. The boys then take turns sending coded messages via innocent-sounding nursery rhymes to their father, including the line “sailing, sailing, over the bounding main, for many a sailing ship can go faster…”. Soon a sleek racing sloop under full sail(immune to the effects of the repeller which only affects motor vessels) approaches and quickly overtakes the slow freighter. Coast Guard officers board and rescue the boys, Sparks, and the captured scientists who had been kidnapped and forced to work for the smuggler. Among them is a chemist who had developed the techniques used to artificially age paper to supply forged documents for sale in the antique / rare document market. The elderly “smuggler” Mitchell turns out to be Mr. McClintock's former business partner and is happily reunited with Mr. McClintock aboard the Father Neptune. With Mitchell rescued, the entire design for the repeller belt is recovered and Mr. McClintock and Mitchell agree to turn the design over to the US Government. The boys, Chet, Biff, and Mr. McClintock then continue their cruise to the Caribbean. The reader is left with a note that the Hardy Boys next mystery will be The Secret of Skull Mountain”.ReferencesThe Hardy Boys books 1947 American novels 1947 children's books 1970 American novels 1970 children's books Novels set on ships GrossetDunlap books", "machine_text": " The Phantom Freighter, also known as the Flying Dutchman, is a legendary sailing ship believed to be cursed and doomed to sail the seas for all eternity. The phantom ship is said to appear suddenly and unexpectedly out of a dense fog and is often reported to be illuminated by ghostly blue lights. It is believed that anyone who sets eyes upon this ill-fated ship is doomed to be taken by the devil. Originating from European maritime mythology and folklore, the phantom freighter is most commonly associated with the Flying Dutchman, a vessel cursed by the Devil after its captain, Vander Decken VI, refused to turn back despite warnings of an impending storm. In mythology, the freighter is said to sail endlessly in search of salvation, but its fate remains cursed, as it can only rest when it has been crossed by a living person. Perhaps the most famous sighting of the phantom freighter occurred in 1881, when the cargo ship godspeed reported seeing a strange sailing vessel, entirely crew less and shrouded in fog. As they drew closer, the crew of the godspeed claimed to have seen a woman on board the phantom freighter, leading many to believe that it was the Flying Dutchman itself. The legend of the phantom freighter has been featured in countless works of literature and film, from William Hope Hodgson’s 1904 novel The Ghost Pirates to Disney’s 2003 film Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. It has also inspired songs, such as The Dubliners’ “The Flying Dutchman” and Iron Maiden’s “The Phantom of the Opera.” Today, the Phantom Freighter remains a captivating figure of folklore and mythology, and continues to be a source of fascination for sailors, adventurers and authors alike. Despite the mysterious and ghostly reputation it has built up over the centuries, it is a reminder of the power of the natural world and a warning against the dangers of ignoring it.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2073892}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"PA-class patrol ship (Germany)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The('patrol boat abroad') (PA)-class patrol ships were a class of vessels commissioned into the Kriegsmarine (German Navy) in the Second World War.The ships were under construction in French shipyards that were seized by the Germans in 1940 at the Fall of France. Work on them continued under German control but progressed slowly, being subject to reluctance, or even sabotage, by the French workforce. Eventually only four were completed. The ships were commissioned in 1943–44 and deployed as escort vessels. Three were bombed and sunk by Royal Air Force (RAF) aircraft in 1944; the fourth was sunk as a block ship at Le Havre later the same year.Background The PA-class patrol vessels were originally laid down as part of a 1939 order by the French Navy for anti-submarine warfare vessels to a British design, called s in the Royal Navy. They were adapted from a merchant ship design and were suitable for building at merchant yards.Of the 18 ships ordered, 12 were under construction at British and six at French yards, four of which were at Chantier de St Nazaire-Penhoët. The order was overtaken by events, and none of the ships ordered was completed before the fall of France in June 1940. Saint-Nazaire, with four ships still under construction, fell into German hands, and as the town was in the occupied zone the Germans decided to complete the vessels for use by the German Kriegsmarine.Design The PA-class ships differed in several respects from the original Smiths Dock design, and therefore from the Flower-class corvettes in service with the Allies. This reflects their construction history and their intended use. The PAs retained the short forecastle which was a feature of the original design, but which the Royal Navy found impractical in heavy weather. Later Allied vessels were given a longer forecastle, and the early ships were altered as they refitted. This did not happen with the PAs, which retained the un-weatherly short forecastle throughout their service careers. The PAs had another original feature, the enclosed merchant-style bridge, though it was abandoned in Allied ships.The focus of the PA class's role was as inshore and coastal escorts, where the chief danger was from mines or attack by aircraft and small craft, such as motor torpedo boats and gunboats. A number of changes to their armament and layout were made to reflect this. The PAs were equipped with minesweeping gear, and to accommodate these items the upswept stern gunwale, a characteristic of the original design, was cut away, producing a flat quarterdeck and simple wire rails. The PAs also had an enhanced anti-aircraft (AA) armament; two sets of twin 37 mm AA guns were fitted in a flying bridge amidships and a set of quadruple 20 mm guns was fitted aft. They also had a 20 mm quadruple mount in a tub set on the roof of the bridge; given the Flowers' reputation for rolling in any seas, putting such a weight so high up would have done no good for their seaworthiness.Service history On completion the four PAs had relatively short service careers. After a four-year building period, none of the ships was in service longer than nine months. The first to be completed, PA 2, joined('15th Outpost Flotilla') in September 1943, and took part in general patrol and escort duties, protecting coastal traffic against air and small craft attack in the English Channel. She was joined by PA 3 in November 1943 and PA 1 in April 1944.The ships took part in a number of naval actions. In September 1943 PA 2 was part of a force escorting the freighter Maladi in the Channel when they were attacked by Allied motor torpedo boats and motor gun boats. One escort was damaged in the action and Maladi was sunk. In January 1944 PA 3 was part of a force that escorted the blockade-runner Münsterland up the Channel, though Münsterland was protected from ships it was sunk by the coastal artillery at Dover. In February PA 2 and PA 3 were with a force that successfully fought off an attack on the tanker Reckum, bringing her safely to Le Havre. The tanker was later sunk by the Dover batteries.In June 1944, during the Allied invasion of Normandy, German naval units in the area came under persistent air attack. During RAF air raids at Le Havre PA 2 - along with six other escorts - was sunk on 15 June and PA 3 was irreparably damaged on 15–16 June. PA 1 survived until August, but was abandoned when the flotilla fled the town ahead of the Allied advance. PA 4 was unfinished when Nantes was liberated. She was launched as La Télindière and sunk as a blockship in April 1945. She was raised and scrapped in 1946.Ships in classNotesBibliographyFurther readingExternal linksWorld War II patrol vessels of Germany 1940s ships", "machine_text": " The PA-class patrol ships (German: PA-Klasse) were a class of patrol ship used by the Imperial German Navy at the beginning of the 20th century. A total of 40 vessels were ultimately built between 1906 and 1914 for patrolling German coastal waters. The vessels were primarily constructed as Einzigartige or Ältere Torpedoboote, a designation in the Imperial Navy used to describe non-torpedo armed vessels up to 90 tons displacement. They ranged in size from 57-66 tons displacement and achieved a maximum speed of 18 knots. The ships carried one 37mm semi-automatic quick-firing gun and one 12-pounder quick-firing gun, as well as a variety of machine guns, an 8mm mountain rifle, and two 450mm and two 450mm torpedoes. The PA-class ships were intended primarily for coastal defense operations, such as escorting and screening of convoys and coastal patrols, and were restricted to traveling in coastal waters and in the North Sea. They were often referred to as 'coastal destroyers' due to the speed and weaponry the vessels were capable of. In the years leading up to the World War I, many of the ships were assigned to minesweeping and coastal defense duties, and after the war, some of the ships remained in service with the Reichsmarine, even going on to be used by Nazi Germany as training vessels. The vessels were typically powered by two Kohler-Greve diesel engines and were popular for their ease of maintenance and reliability. Ultimately, due to the advances in naval technology during the inter-war period, most of the PA-class vessels were disposed of in the late 1930s and early 1940s. However, a handful of the ships survived and are now preserved in various naval museums throughout Germany.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 32294576}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"1987 Maryland train collision\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The 1987 Maryland train collision occurred at 1:30 pm on January 4, 1987, on Amtrak's Northeast Corridor main line. The site of the crash was in the Chase community in eastern Baltimore County, Maryland, United States, at Gunpowder Interlocking, aboutnortheast of Baltimore. Amtrak train 94, the Colonial, (now part of the Northeast Regional) traveling north from Washington, D.C., to Boston, crashed into a set of Conrail locomotives running light (without freight cars), and which had fouled (entered) the mainline. Train 94's speed at the time of the collision was estimated at . Fourteen passengers on the Amtrak train were killed, as well as the Amtrak engineer and lounge car attendant.The Conrail locomotive crew failed to stop at the signals before Gunpowder Interlocking, and it was determined that the accident would have been avoided had they done so. Additionally, they tested positive for marijuana. The engineer served four years in a Maryland prison for his role in the crash. In the aftermath, drug and alcohol procedures for train crews were overhauled by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), which is charged with rail safety. In 1991, prompted in large part by the Chase Maryland crash, the United States Congress took even broader action and authorized mandatory random drug-testing for all employees in 'safety-sensitive' jobs in all industries regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) including trucking, bus carriers and rail systems. Additionally, all trains operating on the high-speed Northeast Corridor are now equipped with automatic cab signalling with an automatic train stop feature. Several safety issues were identified with Amfleet cars as well.At the time, the wreck was the deadliest in Amtrak's history. It was surpassed in 1993, by Big Bayou Canot rail accident in Alabama that killed 47 and injured another 103.Movements of the trains pre-collisionAmtrak Train 94Amtrak Train 94 (the Colonial) left Washington Union Station at 12:30 pm (Eastern time) for Boston South Station. The train had 12 cars and was filled with travelers returning from the holiday season to their homes and schools for the second semester of the year. Two AEM-7 locomotives, numbered 900 and 903, led the train; #903 was the lead locomotive. The engineer was 35-year-old Jerome Evans.After leaving Baltimore Penn Station, the train's next stop was Wilmington, Delaware. Just north of Baltimore, while still in Baltimore County, the four-track Northeast Corridor narrows to two tracks at Gunpowder Interlocking just before crossing over the Gunpowder River. The train accelerated north toward that location.Conrail light engine moveRicky Lynn Gates, a Penn Central and Conrail engineer since 1973, was operating a trio of Conrail GE B36-7 locomotives light (with no freight cars) from Conrail's Bayview Yard just east of Baltimore bound for Enola Yard near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Gates was later determined to have violated several signal and operating rules, including a failure to properly test his cab signals as required before departure from Bayview. It was later discovered that someone had disabled the cab signal alerter whistle on lead unit #5044 with duct tape, muting it almost completely. Also, one of the light bulbs in the PRR-style cab signal display had been removed. Investigators believed these conditions probably existed prior to departure from Bayview and that they would have been revealed by a properly performed departure test.Gates and his brakeman, Edward 'Butch' Cromwell, were also smoking marijuana cigarettes. Marijuana can alter one's sense of time and impair the ability to perform tasks that require concentration. Cromwell was responsible for calling out the signals if Gates missed them, but failed to do so.The collisionAs Amtrak Train 94 approached Gunpowder Interlocking near the Chase community on the electrified main line, the three Conrail freight locomotives were moving north on one of the adjacent freight tracks. Before the adjacent tracks reached the bridge at the river, they merged into the two through tracks that cross the bridge.While the tracks and interlocking plant at this location are signalized to alert locomotive engineer when the interlocking switches are set for through track train movement, the switches are not designed to de-rail a locomotive or train that runs through them when they are aligned for through track train movement.In the case of the accident, the interlocking plant was properly set for through track movement only, so as to allow the Amtrak train to pass the freight locomotives (which should have been stopped on the side tracks) on the through tracks onto and over the bridge. The freight locomotive crew ignored the stop signals in their locomotive cab (which were muted), and at trackside, visible to them from the cab of their locomotive.Speed/event recording devices indicated that the Conrail locomotives were moving at approximatelywhen their brakes were applied for an emergency stop, after they had passed the trackside signals. This was, Gates later claimed, when he realized that he did not have a wayside signal to proceed north at the interlocking. He was, however, moving too fast to stop before passing the signal indicating he should stop clear of the main track on which #94 was approaching. Had Gates reacted either to an approach signal instructing him to reduce speed, or to the stop signal itself in a timely fashion, or had the brakeman called out the state of the signals as he was supposed to do, it was likely the Conrail engines could have stopped short of the switch.The Conrail locomotives came to a stop on the track directly in front of #94, which approached the interlocking at a speed between . Although the maximum allowed speed for Amtrak AEM-7 locomotives carrying cars on this corridor was 125 mph, #94 was carrying one Heritage style passenger car, whose maximum allowed speed was limited to . The conductor for #94 testified that he did inform the fatally injured train engineer of the Heritage car on the train; in any event, its presence meant that the Amtrak train was speeding. With little time to react, Amtrak engineer Evans apparently saw the diesels on the line in front of him and applied the brakes for an emergency stop. The NTSB determined that even if #94 had been travelling at , the Amtrak's authorized speed limit, the collision was unavoidable at this point.On impact, the rearmost Conrail diesel, GE B36-7 #5045 exploded and burned down to the frame completely destroying the unit. The middle unit, #5052, sustained significant damage to the front while lead unit #5044 had little damage.One of Amtrak's AEM-7s, #900, was buried under the wreckage, while the lead locomotive, #903, ended up among some trees on the west side of the right of way. Several Budd Company Amfleet cars were piled up, with some crushed under the pile.Cromwell, who was on the lead locomotive with Gates, suffered a broken leg in the collision. Gates was uninjured. The Amtrak engineer, lounge car Lead Service Attendant and 14 passengers were killed.The front cars on the Amtrak #94 train suffered the greatest extent of damage and were almost completely crushed. However, they were nearly empty - awaiting additional holiday passengers en route who would have boarded the train at stations further north. According to the NTSB, had these cars been fully occupied at the time, the death toll would have been at least 100. There were relatively few passengers on those cars, however, and so the death toll was much less. Most of the dead were on Amtrak car #21236.Post-collision response and cleanupWith a total passenger load of about 600 people, there was a great deal of confusion after the collision. Witnesses and neighbors ran to the smoking train and helped remove injured and dazed passengers, even before the first emergency vehicles could arrive at the location.While many of the injured passengers were aided by nearby residents, some of the uninjured passengers wandered away, making it difficult for Amtrak to know the complete story.Emergency personnel worked for many hours in the frigid cold to extricate trapped passengers from the wreckage, impeded by the stainless-steel Amfleet cars' skin resistance to ordinary hydraulic rescue tools. Helicopters and ambulances transported injured people to hospitals and trauma centers. It was over 10 hours after the collision before the final trapped people were freed from the wreckage.It was several days before the wrecked equipment was removed and the track and electrical propulsion system were returned to service.Conrail diesel, GE B36-7 #5045 was completely destroyed while #5044 and #5052 were repaired and returned to service. Both Amtrak's AEM-7s and a few Amfleet cars were also destroyed in the collision.Investigation, charges and convictionGates and Cromwell initially denied smoking marijuana. However, they later tested positive for the substance. A National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation revealed that had Gates slowed down at the signals as required, he would have stopped in time. It also determined that Gates and Cromwell's marijuana use was the 'probable cause' of the accident. Gates and Cromwell were immediately suspended by Conrail pending an internal investigation, but resigned rather than face certain termination.Gates was eventually charged with manslaughter by locomotive; under Maryland law a locomotive is considered a motor vehicle. Prosecutors cut a deal with Cromwell in which he agreed to testify against Gates in return for immunity. Gates was sentenced to five years in state prison and one year's probation, and was later sentenced to an additional three years on federal charges of lying to the NTSB. Gates' history of DWI (driving while intoxicated) convictions as well as his admission that the crew had been using marijuana while on duty led for a call to certify locomotive engineers as to their qualifications and history.Toxicology tests on the Amtrak engineer's body returned negative. In a 3-2 decision, the NTSB report stated that the speed of train #94 at the time the brakes were applied, between , was an unauthorized excessive speed, since the maximum for an Amtrak train carrying Heritage cars was . The excessive speed was determined to have been a contributing factor to the amount of damage to both trains at the point of impact. The two dissenters to the report believed that it was unreasonable to assign contributory blame to the Amtrak engineer based solely on the premise of the Heritage car lowering its speed limit.Gates was released from prison in 1992 after serving four years (two years of a state sentence, then two more years of a federal sentence), and then worked as an abuse counselor at a treatment center. In a 1993 interview with The Baltimore Sun, Gates said the accident would have never happened if not for the marijuana, saying that it had thrown off his 'perception of speed and distance and time.' He admitted that in his rush to get back to Baltimore and get high, he skipped critical safety checks; he believed that had he performed those checks, 'I wouldn't have been in front of that train.' He also revealed he had smoked marijuana on the job several times.Additionally, it was never determined if the alerter whistle was muted while the locomotives were at Bayview yard. The alerter whistle on these locomotives were notorious for being irritating and loud, which was pointed out in a 1979 accident of a Union Pacific train in Wyoming which involved muting the whistle with a rag. The whistle was easily accessible by removing a cover on the back of the control stand that was sealed with latches, so it was possible for the Conrail crew to have muted the whistle before they left or before the units arrived at Bayview yard (which would have been done by other crews), but Gates reported that the whistle was relatively faint when it was tested, which meant that it could not be heard over the sound of the trailing units. The whistle was so well muted, that when it was sent to the FBI, they were not able to determine when and who muted it, due to the lack of fingerprints.When Conrail unit 5044 was tested after the accident, it was found that all light bulbs (including a replacement for the missing one) were working, and it was undetermined if the light bulb was removed while Conrail and Amtrak left the units unattended. Gates recalled having tested the cab signalling and seeing all the aspects, but he might have not looked at all the lights. The deadmans pedal was also found to have been disabled, when Gates was trying to reactivate the cab signaling system by switching it off in the nose of the locomotive (this was despite the cab signalling and deadmans pedal levers being different in aspect). The data recorder found that the reverser was put into the reverse position two hours after the accident, and the locomotive's fuses, battery and engine switched off.Changes for future preventionAs a result of the wreck, all locomotives operating on the Northeast Corridor are now required to have automatic cab signaling with an automatic train stop feature. Although common on passenger trains up until that time, cab signals combined with train stop and speed control had never been installed on freight locomotives due to potential train handling issues at high speed. Conrail subsequently developed a device called a locomotive speed limiter (LSL), a computerized device that is designed to monitor and control the rate of deceleration for restrictive signals in conjunction with cab signals. All freight locomotives which operate on the Northeast Corridor must now be equipped with an operating LSL which also limits top speed to . Previously, freight locomotives were only required to have automatic cab signals without an automatic train stop feature.Also as a direct result of this collision, federal legislation was enacted that required the FRA to develop a system of federal certification for locomotive engineers. These regulations went into effect in January 1990. Since then, railroads are required by law to certify that their engineers are properly trained and qualified, and that they have no drug or alcohol impairment motor vehicle convictions for the five-year period prior to certification. Another effect was that age-old Rule G (The use of intoxicants or narcotics by employees subject to duty, or their possession or use while in duty, is prohibited. — UCOR, 1962) was revamped to:Employees are prohibited from engaging in the following activities while on duty or reporting for duty:1. Using alcoholic beverages or intoxicants, having them in their possession, or being under the influence.2. Using or being under the influence of any drug, medication, or other controlled substance - including prescribed medication - that will in any way adversely affect their alertness, coordination, reaction, response or safety.Employees having questions about possible adverse effects of prescribed medication must consult a Company medical officer before reporting for duty.3. Illegally possessing or selling a drug, narcotic or other controlled substance.An employee may be required to take a breath test and/or provide a urine sample if the Company reasonably suspects violation of this rule.Refusal to comply with this requirement will be considered a violation of this rule and the employee will be promptly removed from service.Source: NORAC operating rules 6th edition effectiveJanuary 1, 1997A form of Rule G has existed in many railroad operating manuals for decades. However, the federal codification of this rule was deemed necessary to assure that any violator would be dealt with in a consistent and harsh manner. Also, anyone who passes a stop signal loses his or her FRA certification for a period not less than 30 days for a first offense. This is per 49 CFR part 240.In 1991—prompted in large part by the Chase crash—Congress authorized mandatory random drug-testing for all employees in 'safety-sensitive' jobs in industries regulated by DOT.MemorialsTen years after the collision, the McDonogh School of Owings Mills, Maryland decided to build a 448-seat theater in memory of one of the crash's victims and alumna, 16-year-old Ceres Millicent Horn, daughter of American mathematicians Roger and Susan Horn. Ceres Horn graduated from McDonogh at age 15 and enrolled and was accepted at Princeton University at age 16 where she majored in astrophysics.On January 4, 2007, the 20th anniversary of the crash, her family visited the theatre for the first time and attended a ceremony at the McDonogh School held in honor of their daughter.The Baltimore County Fire Department's medical commander at the scene 20 years earlier told the newspaper that the Amtrak crash is still being used as a case study in effective disaster response. 'The reason is how the members of the professional and volunteer fire departments and the community people got together.' It was, he said, 'a very sad but a very proud moment' in his career.See also1996 Maryland train collision, involving two passenger trains Hinton train collision, similar accident in Canada the previous year in which a freight disregarded signals and collided head-on with an intercity passenger train; the freight's crew was also found to have adversely impacted mental capacity (in their case due to insufficient rest and the engineer possibly having a heart attack or stroke) and had disabled safety features as well.ReferencesExternal linksPicture of AEM-7 Amtrak #903 in Wilmington, Baltimore after the crash -  of the 2 Amtrak AEM-7's on flat cars near the accident site - Lancaster Dispatcher - Lancaster Chapter NHRS (January 2010, Vol. 41 #1) -  accidents and incidents in Maryland Railway accidents in 1987 1987 in Maryland Accidents and incidents involving Amtrak Accidents and incidents involving Conrail Chase, Maryland Railway accidents involving a signal passed at danger January 1987 events in the United States Train collisions in the United States Rail accidents caused by a driver's error", "machine_text": " The 1987 Maryland train collision occurred on August 20, 1987 at around 8:30 a.m. in Silver Spring, Maryland, United States. The incident involved two Metro trains, a Green Line and a Red Line train, and resulted in the deaths of 11 people and injury of 175 more. The incident occurred when a Green Line train, operated by Curtis Lovett, departed the Wheaton Metro Station and proceeded toward the Silver Spring station. Lovett had already reported a brake malfunction on the train after the prior stop. The Green Line train operated by Lovett crashed into a stopped Red Line train at around 30 mph just outside of Silver Spring Station, which was located alongside U.S. Route 29. Initial reports said the Green Line train had failed to stop, however, it has been discovered that the Red Line train had been stopped in the station, and the brakes of the Green Line train had malfunctioned. The resulting crash caused significant damage to the rolling stock, as well as serious injuries and deaths of those aboard both trains. In the aftermath of the crash, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) was subject to intense scrutiny, which led to the president of the authority resigning and oversight reforms being applied. Additionally, congressional hearings were held and the National Transportation Safety Board investigated the crash, determining that the main cause of the crash was human error, as well as inadequate safety procedures and standard checklists. The Metro board of directors created a 90 million victims’ compensation package, which was utilized to assist those injured or killed in the crash. Lovett was also sentenced to five years in prison for manslaughter, and the Metro board was required to review its safety protocol to better ensure something like this never happened again. The crash remains the deadliest in Metro’s history, and serves as a stark reminder of the importance of proper safety protocol.

The party's mission statement calls for a commitment to the values of democracy and social progressivism as well as for their expression in the life of the Republic of Italy. It advocates for a strong public sector, the defense of worker's rights, and has strong ties to the European Union. The PSDI is currently led by legislator center-left Riccardo Nencini who was elected leader of the party in December 2016. The PSDI is a member of several different parliamentary groups - most notably the left-wing Party of the European Left, as well as the center-left European Socialists and Italian Socialist Party. They are also members of the Party of Italian Communists and a founder member of the PD. The PSDI has historically been prominent in Italian politics, having been active in all governments between 1996 and 2006, as well as having Prime Minister Luigi Olivetti serve in 1973-1974 and 1980-1981. During the 2018 Italian election, the PSDI was part of the Formation of the Left alliance, which aimed to unite left-leaning parties and provide a alternative to the centre-right coalition led by the Five Star Movement and the Lega Nord. The PSDI was also a part of the Democratic Party-led government from 2018-2019. Despite its historical presence in the government and parliament, the PSDI remains broadly unknown and has had limited electoral success throughout its history. As a result, there is speculation that the PSDI and other smaller parties within center-left will soon face complete absorption into the larger Democratic Party. The Italian Social Democratic Party is a political force with a history going back to the original formation of the Italian state. Despite limited electoral success, the PSDI has achieved a degree of historical success in driving legislation over the years, as well as in contributing to the unity of the Italian left-wing. As changes in the political landscape continue to occur, it remains to be seen whether the PSDI can maintain its hold on Italian politics into the future.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2523417}

The members of the Peromyscus genus are distinguished by their light brown coloring and distinctive white feet. Their ears are larger than most mice and the tail is the same length or slightly longer than their bodies, which are typically between 5 to 8cm in length. They are generally considered semi-arboreal, meaning they inhabit both ground level and trees. Peromyscus mice are omnivorous, meaning they eat a variety of food sources including insects, fruits, grains, and other small vertebrates. Depending on the species, they variously inhabit woodlands, grasslands and deserts. They have adapted to a wide range of climates, from tropical to temperate. Due to the ubiquity of Peromyscus mice, they have been studied extensively by scientists. They also play an important role in understanding human physiological and psychological health due to their genetic similarities to humans. Many species are a natural hosts for hantaviruses, a family of rodents that can cause respiratory illnesses. In addition to their scientific and medical importance, Peromyscus mice provide an important model for studies on animal behaviour. They are versatile and plastic, meaning they can adjust their behaviour in response to environmental pressures. For example, they are attracted to scents from both predators and prey. This means they can quickly learn to avoid danger. In recent years, there have been some troubling changes in the populations of several species of Peromyscus. These declines are attributed to declines in habitat due to human encroachment, changes in climate, and an increase in the number of predators. Ongoing conservation efforts are aimed at preserving the populations of these important animals.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Demonizing the enemy\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Demonizing the enemy, demonization of the enemy or dehumanization of the enemy is a propaganda technique which promotes an idea about the enemy being a threatening, evil aggressor with only destructive objectives. Demonization is the oldest propaganda technique aimed to inspire hatred toward the enemy necessary to hurt them more easily, to preserve and mobilize allies and demoralize the enemy.Basic criteriaBecause of the frequent misuse of the term demonization, it is deprived of its potential to be analyzed. That is why Jules Boykoff defined four criteria of enemy demonization:Both media and state employ frames to portray inherent nature of so-called enemy mostly in moral terms.The character of the opponent is depicted in a Manichean way, as good against evil.The state is the origin of such demonological portraying.There is no significant counterclaim from the state.HistoryThe demonization of the enemy has been routinely conducted throughout the history. Thucydides recorded examples in Ancient Greece.Phillip Knightley believed that demonization of the enemy (first enemy leaders and later enemy individuals) became a predictable pattern followed by Western media, the final stage being atrocities.During the Second World War, propaganda documentaries that contained enemy demonization and flag-waving patriotism were prepared by the US State Department and other state institutions of the United States and distributed, after being approved.Personification and demonizationDemonization of the enemy can be much easier to conduct if the enemy is personalized in one man, such as Kaiser Wilhelm II, who was demonized by the Russian popular media during the First World War.ConsequencesThe strategy of demonization of the enemy unavoidably leads to a vicious cycle of atrocities, which was elaborated by many authors including Carl von Clausewitz. Demonization of the enemy makes diplomatic solution impossible and inevitably leads into the war or worsening of relations. Depicting the enemy as particularly evil inspires feelings that make killings more easy.The portrayal of one's enemy as demonic has often led to the treatment of the whole population or political apparatus associated with the enemy group or leader as equally demonic. This also often results in a tendency to reduce an enemy's more complex motives to simple promotion of pure evil.The Chinese revolutionary theorist Mao Zedong held that the demonization of oneself by the enemy was a good thing. He said, 'It is still better if the enemy attacks us wildly and paints us as utterly black and without a single virtue; it demonstrates that we have not only drawn a clear line of demarcation between the enemy and ourselves but achieved a great deal in our work.'

It has also been increasingly used in propaganda and other forms of group bashing. The term “demonizing the enemy” was first coined in the mid-20th century by German sociologist Niklas Luhmann, in his study on war and conflict. According to Luhmann, demonization consists of “turning those against whom one wages a war into monsters, devils and other supernatural evil forces”. This helps one comprehend the opposition as a total enemy with whom one has no possible relation or dialogue. Demonizing the enemy has been used in a variety of contexts throughout history, including the demonization of “the other” throughout pre-modern Europe and North America. During the European witch-hunts of the 16th and 17th centuries, witches were demonized and dehumanized to the point of being shockingly burned at the stake. In modern warfare, demonization occurs in a variety of forms. Nations will often use the tropes of evil to denounce a foreign nation or ethnic group. For example, during the Kosovo Conflict in 1999, Serbian propaganda depicted Albanians as backwards, black-hearted and demonic. Political opponents and dissidents will also often be scapegoated and demonized through the use of hate speech and rhetoric. For example, in the Philippines, political rivals of President Rodrigo Duterte have been falsely accused of participating in drugs and illegal activities, and have faced death threats. Demonizing the enemy can have an adverse effect as it works to close the borders of dialogue, deepens the hostility between combatants, and creates a sense of “us” versus “them” with no in-between. Many argue that in order to foster peaceful dialogue between enemies, we must look beyond the simplified tropes of good and evil and engage in meaningful mediation. Overall, demonizing the enemy is a dangerous and destructive tactic used to intensify hostilities, create a sense of enmity between enemies, and reduce opponents, individuals and even nations, to one-dimensional stereotypes of evil. Though demonization has been used for centuries, it is still a problem today and must be addressed consistently.

The ritual traditions of Pulingome Mosque also has similar harmonious elements. The annual Makham Uroos conducted in the mosque begins with cooperation of seniors of Kamballur Kottayil Tharavadu.Other Mappila TheyyamThere are almost fifteen Mappila Theyyams that are practiced across areas that were under Kolathunadu in Kasaragod district and parts of Kannur district. .

It is primarily performed by members of the Mappila community, an ethnic group primarily concentrated in the Malabar region. It is a ritual performance that combines elements of folk theatre, tribal ritual and classical dance genres. The performers wear vibrant and elaborate costumes and colorful face masks representing characters from Hindu mythology. Mappila Theyyam combines dance, music, singing, storytelling, and traditional theatre. Music used during the performance is mainly accompanied by taals (drums) and chenda (a traditional cylindrical drum). The performer sings or ‘speaks’ in a specific dialect which takes its cue from the Tahayyam style of chanting found in the MuslimSufi tradition. Mappila Theyyam performances signify the power and influence of many local Mappila families and clans. These performances have been in existence since ancient times, dating back to the period of Cheraman Perumal, a mythical ruler of the time. The major deities associated with the Mappila Theyyam are Kiratham and Bhagavathi. Each Theyyam has a specific style of event management, with numerous rituals requiring clearance and the support of temple committees. The dances of Mappila Theyyam are fast and powerful and portray mythological incidents. There are many popular Theyyams like Kiratham, Malayan, Kallan, Arakka, Kolakka and Tiruvarkkal among others. During a performance, the presence of an offering of mula (rice and sugar) is special and is promptly taken as a mark of respect to the theyyam deity. Mappila Theyyam performances are a reflection of the cultural pride and heritage of Mappila people and have been drawing crowds for decades. These performances are still very popular in the northern regions of Kerala and even in some cities within India and abroad. The popularity of the traditional Mappila Theyyam has helped to revive its presence in the global arena, with numerous performances in foreign countries. In 2003, Mappila Theyyam was declared by UNESCO as a “Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity”. This recognition helped to bring attention to the art form and gave it a boost in popularity. To promote and preserve the traditional folk art and to ensure it remains alive in the years to come, many artists and organizations are coming forward to provide support and promote its cause.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 67646393}

It was described by August Busck in 1907. It is found in North America, where it has been recorded Alabama, Illinois, Kansas, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Arizona and Colorado.The wingspan is about 17 mm. The forewings are ochreous, mottled and longitudinally streaked with white, black and fuscous. The costal edge, from the base to apical third is white, edged below by a narrow streak strongly mottled with fuscous. Below it is a nearly unmottled area of clear ochreous, reaching to the middle of the wing and only transversed by a single dark line on the subcostal vein. From base through the center of the wing run close beside each other two parallel black lines, interrupted at the end of the cell by a round brown dot, but continued on the other side nearly to a small round black dot at the apex. The dorsal part of the wing is rather freely dusted with white and brown scales and on the middle of the fold is an oblong brown dot. The hindwings are light ochreous fuscous.ReferencesMoths described in 1907 Sophronia (moth)", "machine_text": " Sophronia primella is a species of moth belonging to the family Oecophoridae, which was first described by Möschler in 1860. The species is widely distributed in the Caribbean, parts of the United States (Arizona and Florida, for example) and feeds on the larva of the witchhazel leaf beetle and other small-sized insects. The adult moths are most active from April to June and can be found hovering near shrubs during the night. The wingspan of the species spans from 10 to 12 mm, with the overall appearance of the moth being yellowish or buff colored. The bodies of Sophronia primella are very small and slender, with the antennae being highly visible. Their wings are dark brown with white and yellow transverse lines, and the Hindwings being darker brown than the forewings. The size of the moth also makes it an ideal candidate for biocontrol of the witchhazel leaf beetle and other small-sized beetles. The caterpillars of the Sophronia primella feed on the leaves of a wide range of host plants, such as elm, ash, maple and hawthorn. This can cause extensive damage to the trees, which is why the caterpillars are sometimes used as a form of biocontrol to minimise their impacts on trees. Inspecting and controlling populations of Sophronia primella is necessary in order to prevent any economic or environmental damage to host plants, as well as any other damage caused by the caterpillars. The adult moths may be collected using light traps, while the caterpillars can be easily identified and controlled with various insecticides. In addition to its control use, Sophronia primella has been increasingly receiving attention from the scientific community due to its potential application in biomedical and biotechnological research. Research is ongoing on the potential uses of the species’ extract for drug delivery and medical device coatings, as well as its development for enzyme inhibition and cell biology research. Sophronia primella is an interesting and important species due to its wide geographic distribution and potential use in research, as well as its use for controlling the populations of other beetle species. Controlling its populations is necessary to prevent any further damage to host plants, as well as increasing awareness on the potential uses for the species in biotechnology and medicine.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 47610019}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Eduardo Kac\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Eduardo Kac [ɛdwardoʊ kæts; ĕd·wâr′·dō kăts] (1962) is an American contemporary artist whose artworks span a wide range of practices, including performance art, poetry, holography, interactive art, telematic art and transgenic art. He is particularly well known for his works that integrate biotechnology, politics and aesthetics.Kac began his art career in the early 1980s as performance artist in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Within a few years he was involved in exploring holography as an interactive art form. At the same time, he began creating animated poetic works on the French Minitel platform.Before moving from Brazil to the United States in the late 1980s, Kac began creating his first telematic artworks that used electronic technologies to bridge two or more physical locations. During the 1990s he continued to produce these works, at the same time as he coined the phrase bioart. In addition to bioart Kac coined numerous neologisms to describe his transdisciplinary art practice, including holoart, transgenic art (the integration of human genes in an artwork) and plantimal, referring to a plant infused with human genes.Kac is perhaps best known for his transgenic artworks that use biotechnology to intervene on the natural genetic structure of plants and animals. His works Time Capsule, GFP Bunny and Natural History of the Enigma in particular are recognized as notable works for having joined biotechnology, art and bioethics together into politically charged artworks.In 2017 Kac collaborated with the French Space Observatory office to have a sculpture made aboard the International Space Station.A multidisciplinary artist, Kac has also employed poetry, fax, photocopying, photography, video, fractals, poetry, RFID implants, virtual reality, networks, robotics, satellites, telerobotics, Morse code and DNA extraction in his practice.Life Kac was born July 3, 1962 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. He studied at the School of Communications of the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, receiving a BA degree in 1985, and then at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago where he received an MFA degree in 1990. In 2003 he received a doctorate from the University of Wales, Great Britain. Kac is a professor of art at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.Art career1980sBetween 1980 and 1982, Kac belonged to a group that did performance art in the Cinelandia area of Rio de Janeiro. The performances, a response to the extreme conservative political climate of Brazil under military dictatorship, became known asMovimento de Arte Pornô (Porn Art Movement).Beginning in 1983, Kac created holographic poetry works, the first of which was HOLO/OLHO, named after the Portuguese word for 'eye'. 24 holographic poems followed this first work, including Quando (When?) (1987), a moebius-like work that could be read in two directions.Around the same time, and drawing on his interest in experimental poetry forms, Kac began making animated poetry works with the French Minitel videotex terminals that were then in use in Rio. In 1985 he contributed one such work, Reabracadabra, to the Arte On Line exhibition, organized by the Livraria Nobel bookstore in São Paulo. Other videotex animated poems by Kac include Recaos (1986), Tesão (1985/86) and D/eu/s (1986). In 1986, with Flavio Ferraz, Kac organized the Brasil High-Tech exhibition at the Galeria de Arte Centro Empresarial Rio in Rio de Janeiro.From 1985 to as late as 1994, Kac did a number of telecommunications performances that used Slow-scan television (SSTV)and FAX technologies to create performances between separate locations.In the late 80s Kac began work on his Ornitorrinco project, a telepresence artwork made in collaboration with Ed Bennett in Chicago. The work brought together robotics, telecommunications technologies and interactivity to create a robot that was controlled remotely. The piece allowed viewers in one location to control the robot's camera and motion, creating a telepresent work and effecting the experience of viewers in the other location.In 1989 Kac moved from Brazil to Chicago, where he would complete his MFA at the Art Institute of Chicago the following year.1990sIn the 1990s, Kac continued creating telematic works, with Dialogical Drawing (1994) and Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1994) both using networks to explore the viewer experience of an artwork mediated between two site in real time. In the latter case, the artwork joined a plant in New York city and a live canary in Kentucky in conversation. The inclusion of a bird as part of its system, making it an early example of what Kac called transgenic art.In Teleporting An Unknown State (1994–96), Kac built a system that allowed a plant to survive in a gallery, illuminated not by sunlight but by the internet viewers of the work. In practice, online viewers of the work triggered a video projection onto the plant of an image representing the sky in the viewer's home location.Notably, Kac coined the term 'bioart' with his 1997 performance work Time Capsule. In Time Capsule, Kac implanted himself with an RFID chip originally designed for use in pets. A participant in Chicago then triggered the RFID scanned in the Brazilian Gallery where Kac was performing, casing the scanner to display a unique code for the implant. Kac then registered himself on the pet database associated with the implant, becoming the first human to do so.By the late 90s Kac defined himself either a 'transgenic artist' or 'bio artist,' and was using biotechnology and genetics to create provocative works that concomitantly explore scientific techniques and critique them.Kac's next transgenic artwork, created in 1998/99 and titled 'Genesis,' involved him taking a quote from the Bible (Genesis 1:26 - 'And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth'), transferring it into Morse code, and finally, translating that Morse code (by a conversion principle specially developed by the artist for this work) into the base pairs of genetics.Participants were then able to shine ultraviolet lights onto the base pair of genetics thus altering it. So when Kac translated it back to English, it said something completely different. This work sparked a conversation about how meaning can change throughout translation.2000s In one of his best known works, Alba, presented in 2000 in Avignon, France, Kac claimed to have commissioned a French laboratory to create a green-fluorescent rabbit; a rabbit implanted with a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) gene from a type of jellyfish. Under a specific blue light, the rabbit fluoresces green. The work proved to be hugely controversial, which was later mitigated by the revelation that the GFP process was not new but was, rather,already in use on rabbits at the lab in question.Kac's original aim was for Alba to live with his family, but prior to the scheduled release of Alba to Kac, the lab retracted their agreement and decided that Alba should remain in the lab.His work Natural History of the Enigma (2003-8) continued in the theme of bio art by merging his DNA with that of a petunia, creating a hybrid organism that Kac called a plantimal. The plant, also given the name Eudinia (from Eduardo and Petunia), mimicked the flow of blood through human veins by mixing Kac's DNA only with the plant's genetic components that made the veins in its leaves red.2010s In 2017 Kac collaborated with the French astronaut Thomas Pesquet to create an artwork in space called Inner Telescope. Following Kac's instructions, Pesquet cut and folded a piece of paper into a sculptural form that could be read as the three letters forming the French word for me, M-O-I.Permanent collections Kac's work is included in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, Tate Modern, London, Institut Valencià d'Art Modern in Valencia, Spain, Les AbattoirsToulouse, France, and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. Several of Kac's artists' books are included in the library of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.Awards In 1998 he received the Leonardo Award for Excellence from ISAST. In 1999, he received the Inter Communication Center (Tokyo) Biennial Award in 1999.In 2002 he received the Creative Capital Award in the discipline of Emerging Fields.In 2008 he received the Golden Nica award at Ars Electronica for his project Natural History of the Enigma.Bibliography Books by Eduardo KacKac, Eduardo.

His sister Teishi (Sadako) was married to Emperor Ichijō, and Korechika aspired to become the regent (Sessho) for his young brother-in-law after his father's death.Korechika's (ultimately fruitless) ambitions pitted him against his powerful uncle, Fujiwara no Michinaga, and the resulting power struggle continued until Empress Teishi's unexpected death. This left Michinaga's daughter, Shoshi, as Ichijō's sole empress, solidifying Michinaga's power at court.In Chōtoku 2 (長徳２年) (996), Korechika and his younger brother Takaie were exiled to Dazaifu. Korechika was charged with shooting an arrow at Retired Emperor Kazan, and performing an esoteric Shingon curse known as Daigensuihō (大元帥法), which was reserved solely for the emperor.

He was a son of Fujiwara no Fusasaki and was part of the influential Fujiwara family, which dominated much of the court life in Japan for centuries. He was a renowned scholar, particularly noted for his knowledge of the Chinese classics, and was one of the most important figures of thoughts during the decline of the Heian court. Korechika first appears in the Sankanbon, a court-produced collection of historical documents, in 840, at the age of 21. He was quickly recognized for his knowledge of Chinese literature and was soon assigned to various influential positions. In 874 he was appointed to the post of Sadaijin, or Minister of the Left, a prestigious position in the court that he held throughout his life. Korechika is best remembered for his influence in the court during the reign of Emperor Uda. During this period, Uda was trying to re-establish the political power of the court by emphasizing the importance of Chinese texts and literature. Korechika was a strong proponent of this idea and he worked hard to educate courtiers on the subject. His promotion of Chinese ideals also had a profound influence on the philosophy of the court. Korechika also held a prominent role in the development of the Japanese language and linguistics. He was the first to create a full set of grammatical rules for the Japanese language and argued for a more unified style between the spoken and written language. He also introduced a new style of letter writing that heavily emphasized visuals and aesthetics. Korechika was well known for his unwavering dedication to scholarly pursuits. He was also known for his generosity, so much so that Emperor Uda supposedly said “the only people in the court who cared about others were Korechika and the gods.” Korechika's influence on the Heian court can be seen in many works of literature. He is known to have been the patron of several authors, including Murasaki Shikibu, the author of The Tale of Genji, the world's first novel. He is also credited with founding the poetic tradition of renga in 814, and is credited with the establishment of the Genroku period, a period of great artistic, literary and poetic creativity. Korechika died in 894, leaving behind a legacy as one of the most influential figures in Heian culture. His lasting legacy was an appreciation for scholarship and learning, as well as a greater appreciation for the beauty and complexity of the Japanese language.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 14688254}

Created by the merger of Far Eastern College and the Institute of Accounts, Business, and Finance, FEU became a university in 1934 under the guidance of its first president, Nicanor Reyes Sr.The first accountancy and business school for Filipinos, the university, through the years, has expanded its course offerings to the arts and sciences, architecture, fine arts, education, engineering, computer studies, graduate studies, tourism and hotel management, law, nursing, and medicine. FEU has five campuses located in Metro Manila and Cavite. It offers programs from elementary, secondary, tertiary, to graduate school.FEU Manila comprises several Institutes that offer specific programs. The accountancy program, along with its other undergraduate programs, have received the highest Level IV accreditation from the Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities Commission on Accreditation (PACUCOA). The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) has also granted it as a Center of Development in Business Administration and a Center of Excellence for Teacher Education.Since its establishment in 1928, FEU has produced national artists, business tycoons, ambassadors, justices of the Supreme Court and other judicial bodies, technocrats in private and government sectors, finance wizards, acclaimed physicians, nurses, educators, theater and media luminaries and so many others in different fields of expertise.History The Far Eastern University was founded in November 1933 when the Far Eastern College and the Institute of Accounts, Business, and Finance (IABF) merged. Far Eastern College, founded in 1919 by Vicente K. Fabella (the first Filipino CPA), Nicanor Maronilla-Seva, Francisco Africa, Pedro Cortez, and Salvador Unson, had been a liberal arts college in Quiapo; while the IABF had been established (originally under the name Institute of Accountancy) by Francisco Dalupan Sr. and Nicanor Reyes Sr., then head of the Department of Economics at the University of the Philippines, with a number of other prominent educators in 1928. IABF had been originally predominately used by night students, and the new University, which was supported by the tuition provided by its students rather than government grants, soon demonstrated that a private university was financially sustainable in the Philippines.In the early 1930s, FEU was housed in a converted tobacco factory (La Oriente Fabrica de Tabacos y Compania; boundary of Quiapo and Sampaloc district lots) already present on theproperty lot owned by Sulucan Hill subdivision. Due to the widening of the street that became Quezon Blvd., the original building designed and built by Architect Pablo Antonio Sr. (National Artist for Architecture) was demolished and had to be rebuilt on a bigger scale on what is the present campus of FEU.In 1934, the Institute of Law was founded. Two years later, the Institute of Technology was founded, with Fransisco Santana its first dean. In April 1938, the FEU Junior College was opened in Lingayen, Pangasinan.Nicanor Reyes Sr. was the first founding president of the university, which spent its early years establishing several of its institutes, including those of Law and Technology. Reyes Sr. commissioned Architect Pablo S. Antonio Sr., his brother in law and husband of his sister Marina del Rosario Reyes-Antonio, who would later be titled as National Artist under the National Artist of the Philippines awards, to construct the main building for the school. In 1939, the Nicanor B. Reyes Sr. Hall, which would later house the main library at third level and Institute of Accounts, Business and Finance, opened. Two other buildings by Antonio, the Girls’ High School Building and Boys High School Building, followed in 1940 and 1941, by which year FEU had 10,000 registered students, with an international student population of 400. Then Philippine President Manuel L. Quezon hailed and called FEU 'the best non-sectarian institution in the country.'In 1941, FEU also had the first ROTC quartermaster and ROTC finance units in the Philippines. During the American colonial period FEU ROTC was notable for having the first Coastal Artillery unit in the Philippines. During World War II, FEU cadets fought in Bataan with the Second Infantry Division. FEU constituted the majority of cadets who received armor training. These cadets were trained to operate the American M5 light tank. At the time that the FEU's coast artillery unit was formed, the Philippine Army's Coast Artillery was equipped with the 155mm GPF gun. During the Philippine–American War, the Philippine coast artillery had one 150mm Ordóñez gun. It is said that of all the Philippine colleges whose students and alumni volunteered for military service at the outbreak of the Pacific War in 1941, FEU men formed the greatest number.In 1942, the Far Eastern University campus was used as a multi-functional facility by the Imperial Japanese Army Transportation Corps. It was later used as the Prisoner of War Bureau for the Japanese Army.During World War II, the campus was occupied by the Imperial Japanese Army as their base. The main building sustained bullet damage while the other three buildings (Girls High, Boys High, and the old Technology Building) did not.Nicanor B. Reyes Sr. having been killed during the Japanese occupation, Hermengildo B. Reyes was appointed the second president of the university when it reopened in 1945.The university was re-opened in October 1945 despite the use of most of its facilities by the American forces until their departure in May 1946, the post-liberation years saw the renaissance of FEU with its massive expansion of facilities aimed at meeting the demands of modern and relevant education in the country and the increasing student population. FEU was once named as the “Largest University in Asia”, in the early 1950s when its enrollment passed near 50,000 students.Thereafter, FEU continued to expand, with the opening of the Science Building and the establishment of the Institute of Medicine and the School of Nursing. In 1955, the FEU Hospital was inaugurated. Humanities were introduced in 1959, and in 1970 the Institute of Architecture and Fine Arts opened. Also in 1970, the for-profit status of the Institute of Medicine, School of Medical Technology, FEU Hospital and the Student Health Service Clinic was altered, when these were converted into the Far Eastern University – Nicanor Reyes Medical Foundation, a non-stock, non-profit educational foundation.In 1989, Nicanor Reyes Jr. introduced substantial revitalization to FEU that took place over a number of years, with renovation and modernization of facilities and grounds and upgrading of the university's educational standard. This resulted in the accreditation of the Institute of Arts and Sciences, the Institute of Education, and the Institute of Accounts, Business and Finance, and, in the mid-1990s, the deregulation of the university by the Commission on Higher Education. The auditorium was upgraded to accommodate modern stage productions and the new twice-monthly presentations by local and international artists established by the President's Committee on Culture. The university also prioritized publication, launching a number of scholarly journals, and began networking with other institutions nationally and abroad.After careful study of the technology program, the administration in 1992 decided to phase it out in favor of a computer technology program forged with the East Asia Computer Center, Inc. which offered degrees in computer science and certificate courses.In 2010, FEU established the Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management and the FEU Makati campus, which started its operations by June of the same year. FEU Makati offer master's degree program in Business Administration and Baccalaureate programs in Accountancy, Accounting Technology, Information Technology and Business Administration.CorporateThe Far Eastern University, Incorporated () is a domestic non-sectarian educational institution founded in June 1928 and was registered and incorporated with the Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission on October 27, 1933.

After the success of No Gentlemen (1881), other books followed, including A Sane Lunatic (1882), Dearly Bought (1884), Next Door (1886), Young Maids and Old (1888), The Mistress of Beech Knoll (1890), and Miss Bagg's Secretary (1892). The daughter of George Frederick Root, she wrote the text for several his most successful cantatas. The 1923 film, A Chapter in Her Life is based on Burnham's 1903 novel Jewel: A Chapter in Her Life. Born in Massachusetts, she died at the family home in Maine in 1927.Early life and education Clara Louise Root was born in Newton, Massachusetts, May 25, 1854. She was one of six children, and the oldest daughter of Dr. George Frederick Root, the musical composer, and the former Mary Woodman. Her father, becoming the senior partner of the Chicago firm of RootCady, removed with his family to that city when Burnham was very young, and Chicago was her home thereafter. A return for several summers to the old homestead in North Reading, Massachusetts, together with the memory of the first years of her life, gave her an acquaintance with New England dialect and character, which she used later in her work. As a girl, she chiefly pursued music.CareerBurnham married while she was still very young. Shortly after her marriage, a brother, who enjoyed reading her letters, urged her to write a story. The brother persisted for months, and at last, in order to show him the absurdity of his request, she began writing. To Burnham's surprise, her attitude soon changed. She wrote two novelettes and paid to have them critiqued by the reader of a publishing house, keeping her identity unknown. The response was unfavorable, the reader going so far as to say that, if the author were of middle age, she would better abandon all hope of success as a writer. Burnham, not being 'of middle age,' was as reluctant to stop writing as she had previously been to take it up. Recalling her lifelong ability for rhyming, she wrote some poems for children, which were accepted and published by Wide Awake, and that success fixed her determination.She wrote No Gentlemen (Chicago, 1881) and offered it to a Chicago publisher. He examined it, said it would be an unsafe first book, and advised her to go home and write another. The author's father, who until that time had not regarded her work seriously, liked No Gentlemen and believed in it. Through his interest, the book immediately found a publisher, and its success was instantaneous. Other books followed including, A Sane Lunatic (Chicago, 1882), Dearly Bought (Chicago, 1884), Next Door (Boston, 1886), Young Maids and Old (Boston, 1888), The Mistress of Beech Knoll (Boston, 1890), and Miss Bagg's Secretary (Boston, 1892). Besides her novels, Burnham wrote the text for several of Root's most successful cantatas, and contributed many poems and stories to 'Youth's Companion,' 'St. Nicholas ' and 'Wide Awake.' The 1923 film, A Chapter in Her Life is based on Burnham's novel Jewel: A Chapter in Her Life.Personal life Burnham had no children and she resided with her father. In addition to her write, she was a cultured pianist. In religion, she affiliated with Christian Scientist.

She is best known for her collection of poems and verses for children, which were highly praised for their beauty and charm. Burnham was born in 1860 in Kingston, New York, to William J. and Julia A. Burnham. Her mother was a well-known singing teacher, and taught her daughter from a young age. Burnham started publishing her poetry in newspapers by the age of 11. At 17, she moved to New York City, where she wrote for various magazines. Burnham quickly gained recognition as a skilled poet, and in 1881, she published her first book of verse, Sylvan Songs. The book was an immediate success and established her as a major writer. Her writing was praised by leading literary figures of the time, including Walt Whitman, Thomas Bailey Aldrich, and Edward Everett Hale. Over the next several years, Burnham wrote several more books of poetry and children's verses, which were widely anthologized. In addition to her poetry and literature, Burnham was also an accomplished linguist, translating works from French and German into English. She was also a frequent contributor to the music industry, writing lyrics for a variety of songs in different genres. Burnham passed away in 1917 at the age of 57. She was survived by a sister, a brother and two children.

Most species are endemic to river basins in the Himalayas and Qinghai–Tibet Plateau of China, but S. stoliczkai extends into the highlands of Afghanistan, Iran, northern India, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan and Tajikistan.S. younghusbandi is up to almostin total length, but the remaining species generally only reach about two-thirds of that size. Similar to Platypharodon, Schizopygopsis have a horny sheath on the lower jaw and spoon-shaped teeth that they use to scrape off periphyton and algae from stones, but they will also eat benthic invertebrates.Schizopygopsis is a part of the schizothoracines (snowtrout and allies), which also includes the genera Aspiorhynchus, Chuanchia, Diptychus, Gymnodiptychus, Gymnocypris, Oxygymnocypris, Platypharodon, Ptychobarbus, Schizopyge and Schizothorax.Species There are currently eight recognized species in this genus:Schizopygopsis anteroventris WuTsao, 1989Schizopygopsis kessleri Herzenstein, 1891Schizopygopsis kialingensis W.

The genus contains over twenty species, most of which inhabit upland rivers and streams with cool to cold water environments. Some species may also enter waters around lakes and the edges of wetlands. The majority of Schizopygopsis species are medium-sized, with adults growing up to 25 cm (9.8 in) in length. They can be identified by their streamlined and laterally compressed bodies, featuring large eyes, powerful jaws and teeth, as well as muscular dorsal and caudal fins. Whilst adults of the species display a gray-brown coloration dorsally, most species also exhibit a distinct color pattern on the sides and belly, often with patterns of blue, green and red. The diet of Schizopygopsis consists mainly of aquatic insects such as midge larvae, crustaceans, and the larvae and eggs of other fish. In turn, the adults and juveniles of Schizopygopsis are consumed by a variety of predators, such as herons and hawks, as well as other fish. Schizopygopsis species may also occasionally enter into spawning migrations. For example, the Schizothorax richardsonii may migrate up to 40 km (25 miles) from their year-round habitats in isolated rivers to reach the tributaries of large lakes. When spawning, adults of this species may form dense aggregations. Upon hatching, larvae of most species drift downstream until they reach nursery habitats of shallower, warmer waters. Like many species of cyprinids, Schizopygopsis species are an important food source for local populations and are widely fished. Thus, there is intense pressure on these species, particularly in areas where capture limits are not regulated. As Schwizopygopsis inhabit relatively narrow ranges, they are susceptible to habitat changes that can affect their limited populations and also increase the risks of overfishing. Therefore, it is widely recommended that management plans be established to conserve these populations. Management plans should include provisions for setting appropriate catch limits and protecting their habitats from both chemical and physical disturbance. Furthermore, research should be conducted to better understand the ecology of these species and the effects of various environmental changes.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 25905853}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Springside (Poughkeepsie, New York)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Springside was the estate of Matthew Vassar in Poughkeepsie, New York, United States. It is located on Academy Street just off US 9. Detailed plans for a landscape, villa, and complex of farm buildings were drawn up by the influential Andrew Jackson Downing with assistance of Calvert Vaux prior to the former's death. The landscaping was completed and remains Downing's most intact surviving landscape, but only a few of the buildings he planned were ever built; most have since been lost to fire and structural failure. A cottage where Vassar resided was dismantled and removed in the mid-1970s. Its facade is on display in the New York State Museum.Downing's landscape, in the English landscape gardening tradition, has survived several serious efforts to redevelop the property in the last half-century due to opposition from local preservationists. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Matthew Vassar Estate, and further it was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1969, but the estate was not permanently protected for almost two decades, when a lawsuit was settled with the transfer of the land to its current owners, Springside Landscape Restoration.HistorySpringside's development took up much of the last two years of Downing's life, and the latter years of Vassar's. The unfinished estate was maintained and developed by several other families for a century afterward. Their descendants were more amenable to selling the land for development in the years afterward, which led in turn to the efforts to protect and restore it.Planning and development under VassarThe Springside property was the 'Allen farm', first a family farm, then an ornamental farm of roughly 45 acres (18 ha), twice its current size. It takes its name from a spring on the property. It was considered as a site for a cemetery by the then-village of Poughkeepsie in 1848. Vassar, a village trustee and founder of the nearby college that bears his name, bought the property from its last owner George Bloom Evertsonfor 8,000, intending to sell subscriptions to future plots at the cemetery to local investors, a common practice at the time. However, there were few takers. He had planned to develop the property as a private summer estate himself if the cemetery plan failed, and so he contracted Downing, who lived downriver in Newburgh, to begin planning the landscape for the property.By 1851, Downing, in collaboration with his associate Calvert Vaux and Vassar, had detailed landscape plans ready. The next year, the city of Poughkeepsie chose another site for the cemetery, ending that possibility. Downing's death in a steamboat boiler explosion the following year did not halt development, as Vassar and Vaux continued along the lines Downing had established. At least two of Downing's planned structures, a barn and a gardeners' cottage, were built, and he eventually invested100,000 in developing the site. The villa they designed to be the main house of the estate, a semi-Jacobethan work, was abandoned (although artists' renderings survive), since Vassar preferred the cottage as a residence.As Springside continued to grow and develop, Vassar regularly opened the lands to the public until he retired to it full-time in 1867, the year before his death. It became a popular place to visit and inspired poetry and songs. One visitor, Russell Comstock, wrote:After Vassar After Vassar's death, the lands were divided among several other local families, who continued to work the landscape. Judge Homer Nelson, New York's Secretary of State, bought the southern half of the property and renamed it Hudson Knolls. He lived elsewhere while a boardinghouse operated on the site. The northern half was purchased by local shoe manufacturer John Whitehouse, who merged it with his own adjoining property to the west of the site, retaining the Springside name. It passed to his son-in-law Eugene Howell upon his death, who kept up the landscape, at one point using it as a golf course, despite the failure of the shoe factory in 1891.In 1901, the property was reunified under the ownership of William Nelson Jr. (1829 - 1905), who had previously purchased the southern half when Judge Nelson (to whom he was not related) died in 1881, bought Howells' half following the shoe heir's bankruptcy. Nelson, who for the latter half of the 1800s, ran the Red Ball Line shipping company founded by his father, William Nelson Sr. in the 1820s, lived in the former boardinghouse with his family. He bequeathed it to his wife Marie Christiana Nelson (1860 - 1932), and she in turn passed it on to their children, Gerald, Geraldine, and Gertrude.The two daughters and son kept the property in the family after Marie Christiana passed on, with the daughters, Geraldine and Gertrude, living out most of their lives there. Gertrude Nelson Fitzpatrick and her husband lived in the cottage, while her sister Geraldine Acker and her husband Earnest R. Acker built a house for themselves in 1929 on the site where Downing had intended for Springside's main house, calling the new house 'Spring Gables'.Late 20th-century preservationThe combination of private ownership and benign neglect had preserved much of Downing and Vassar's original design for a century. This situation would change as Poughkeepsie experienced rapid growth in the years after World War II.In 1952 development pressure began when the Poughkeepsie City School District considered Springside as a site for a new high school. In the 1960s, historic preservation efforts started in response to increasing development in the area led to the estate being declared a National Historic Landmark (NHL) in 1969. The NHL designation could not protect the barn complex from being totally destroyed by arson later that month, and the other buildings suffered from continued decay and neglect. Development threats continued as the landowner, developer Robert Ackerman, persuaded the city to rezone the property to make it more amenable to the luxury apartment complex he planned to build. He pledged to protect the gatehouse and cottage, but the landscaping would have substantially altered Downing's original design.The cottage facade was removed to an Albany warehouse by state order to preserve it in 1976; a quarter-century later it was put on display at the State Museum. Only the foundation clearing remains at the site. In 1982, a nearby condominium complex proposed nearby, and approved by the city, would have cleared most of Downing's remaining landscape. A lawsuit two years later alleging an insufficient environmental impact statement was settled in 1986 with the development of the farm portion of the property, close to Route 9 and the river, while the remaining landscape donated to a newly established non-profit organization, Springside Landscape Preservation, which continues to maintain the property. It took formal title to the land in 1990.Today, only the Carpenter Gothic gatehouse, a building not found on the original plans, survives. It has been restored to its original colors and is still used as a private residence.AestheticsDowning had become a bestselling writer by expounding on his theories of combining that which was beautiful in nature and art. The buildings at Springside, both planned and built, used consciously rustic board-and-batten siding, emphasized by some of the thousand trees he had transplanted from nearby forests. On the ground, the curving pathways follow the contours of the land beneath them and lead to scenic views, sometimes created by planting evergreens around rock outcropsStatuary embellishments unite the buildings and grounds, and Downing took advantage of the property's natural drainage to create streams and fountains. Above the spring that gave the property its name, later itself named Willow Spring by Vassar, he placed a statue of a dog, since replaced by one of a young maiden. Ponds, too, were created, their irregular, natural shapes accentuated by similarly shaped islands. Many of these features that Downing pioneered were later replicated by Vaux and his fellow associate of Downing's, Frederick Law Olmsted, in their designs for Central Park and other major parks in American cities.Today, with most of the buildings no longer extant on the site, the landscape still largely reflects Downing's original plan. Some secondary vegetation has grown in, but the pathways have been restored and many of the original trees remain.See alsoEnglish Landscape Garden styleReferencesExternal linksSpringside Landmark Restoration Unofficial Springside website by a graduate student at City College of New York Springside at the Vassar College EncyclopediaNational Historic Landmarks in New York (state) Gardens in New York (state) Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in New York (state) Historic American Buildings Survey in New York (state) Landscape design history of the United States National Register of Historic Places in Poughkeepsie, New York Houses in Poughkeepsie, New York U.S. Route 9 Houses completed in 1850 Carpenter Gothic houses in New York (state) Buildings and structures in the United States destroyed by arson Arson in New York (state) Burned houses in the United States", "machine_text": " Springside is a neighborhood in the city of Poughkeepsie, New York. Located approximately 4 miles south of the city's downtown area, the neighborhood is situated along the western bank of the Hudson River. The community is considered to be part of a larger group of neighborhoods making up the city's “Southside”. The neighborhood was first established as early as the mid-1800s when the Poughkeepsie Eagle Steamboat Line created stops along the riverbanks. A single neighborhood road in the area, known as Springside Avenue, is one of the last remaining traces of the original steamboat stops, and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Eventually Springside was home to several factories, including the Dutchess Lace Mills in 1865, which closed in 1945. Today, the Springside neighborhood is home to a largely diverse population of both families and local business owners. Residents enjoy convenient access to local stores, restaurants, and recreational areas including the waterfront walkway where one may take in breathtaking views of the Hudson River. Other attractions in the area include Home of Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site, Four Brothers Double Drive-In and Mid-Hudson Children’s Museum. In recent years, Springside has experienced an influx of businesses and developers investing in the area to improve the quality of life and the value of homes in the area. The neighborhood has seen the construction of dozens of new homes and businesses, while keeping the same charm and history that has made it a primary residential choice in the city. Those looking to move to the Springside area should be aware of the water and sewage services provided by the Poughkeepsie City Water and Sewer Department, and any associated costs. Additionally, due to its proximity to the Hudson River, additional home and flood insurance may be required. Springside is a charming community that offers plenty for its residents.

The other tracks on the album feature Brubeck's trademark compositions and arrangements, including 'Out of Nowhere,' 'Love Walked In,' 'Just Squeeze Me,' 'Monica' and 'Audrey.' The recording is known for its clarity and balance, allowing the individual instruments to shine through, the highlight being the interplay between Brubeck and Desmond. In 1955, CBS released the album in LP and 4-track reel-to-reel formats. It was re-released in stereo in 1963 with one additional track, 'Easy Living,' which was taken from a 1954 performance at Storyville Club. In 1998, the original 1955 masters were released on CD. Since its release, Bravo! Brubeck! has come to be recognized as one of Brubeck's finest albums and has been cited by some critics as the top pick for a perfect evening of jazz. It has been praised for its innovation and its expansive sound, and has been a cultural touchstone for generations of jazz aficionados. The success of the album led to an increased popularity for the quartet and for Brubeck. In the decades since its release, Bravo! Brubeck! has come to be seen as one of the most influential jazz albums of all time and has been cited as a major influence on the work of countless contemporary jazz musicians.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 49964200}

Eventually, he turned the attention of his practice to anesthesia. In 1919, he published the landmark paper, “Why The Professional Anesthetist,” describing the inadequacies of anesthetic practices across the country.By 1927, his reputation had grown such that he was recruited as a professor at the University of Wisconsin. There, he set up the country's first separate department of anesthesia at a medical school and established a resident training program in anesthesia.For example, the photograph shows Dr. Waters in 1937, with fifteen male residents and one female resident, Dr. Virginia Apgar.Among his contributions to the field were the development of the gas cyclopropane for clinical use, the carbon dioxide absorption method, and endobronchial anesthesia for thoracic surgery.Waters was instrumental in outsourcing his resident training model to other universities and hospitals, including Bellevue Hospital, where he sent his assistant, Emery Rovenstine in 1935; and the University of Pennsylvania, where his protege Robert Dripps implemented the model. He invented an oropharyngeal airway made up of metal, now known as Water's Airway.References1883 births 1979 deaths American anesthesiologists University of Wisconsin–Madison alumni Case Western Reserve University alumni", "machine_text": " Ralph M.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Berzosertib\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Berzosertib (VE-822, VX-970, M6620) is a drug originally invented by Vertex Pharmaceuticals and licensed to Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany for development. It acts as a potent inhibitor of the enzyme ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR) and with lower potency as an inhibitor of ATM serine/threonine kinase (ATM). These enzymes are both involved in detecting DNA damage as part of cell cycle checkpoints during cell division. By inhibiting their activity, berzosertib interferes with the ability of rapidly dividing cells to detect damage to DNA, and this makes it useful as a potential treatment for some forms of cancer by causing accumulation of DNA damage in the cancer cells and thus reducing their viability. It has progressed furthest in trials for the treatment of ovarian cancer, though also shows activity against numerous other cancer types.Phase 1 trial results show promising results in the first clinical trial of the drug class.The new study, designed to test the drug's safety, found that half of patients given the new drug either alone or with platinum chemotherapy saw their cancer stop growing, and two patients saw their tumors shrink or disappear completely.In a UCLA-led study, berzosertib showed promise in treating COVID-19.ReferencesEnzyme inhibitors", "machine_text": " Berzosertib is an investigational medicine in the class of compounds known as ATR Kinase Inhibitors. Its principal mechanism of action is to inhibit the activity of ATM-dependent protein kinases, which are involved in DNA damage signalling and the responses to such damage. Berzosertib was developed by Array BioPharma and is undergoing clinical trials as a potential treatment for advanced solid tumor cancers such as non-small cell lung cancer and castration-resistant prostate cancer. Berzosertib is a small-molecule, orally administered therapy with impressive activity in several solid tumor indications, including lung and prostate cancer. It has shown to be well-tolerated and has a good absorption profile. It works to inhibit the enzyme ATR kinase from its active conformation, preventing the signal transduction of DNA damage and triggering downstream DNA repair pathways. In this way, it targets major defense mechanisms of cancer cells and promotes cell death. Berzosertib is currently in Phase II trials for several tumor types including non-small cell lung cancer, castration-resistant prostate cancer, bladder cancer, biliary tract cancer and gall bladder cancer. Results from the Phase II clinical trials seem to be promising, showing that the combination of berzosertib and chemotherapy was able to reduce tumor size in advanced non-small cell lung cancer capably while being well-tolerated. In patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer, berzosertib in combination with androgen deprivation therapy appeared to reduce tumor load in a statistically significant manner when compared to patients who were given androgen deprivation therapy alone. Additionally, results suggest a potential benefit of berzosertib over chemotherapy-based treatments. Berzosertib appears to be a promising drug candidate for the treatment of various solid tumor cancers. Its principal mechanism of action targeting ATR kinase has shown to be effective in killing cancer cells, and the drug is well-tolerated. Thus, Berzosertib may have the potential to become the treatment of choice for many advanced solid tumor cancers in the near future. Further clinical trials are needed to evaluate its safety and efficacy beyond the initial phase trials and to determine its utility for other cancer types.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 64365868}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Pope Francis\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Pope Francis (; ; ; born Jorge Mario Bergoglio, 17 December 1936) is the head of the Catholic Church and sovereign of the Vatican City State since 2013. Francis is the first pope to be a member of the Society of Jesus, the first from the Americas, the first from the Southern Hemisphere, and the first pope from outside Europe since Gregory III, a Syrian who reigned in the 8th century.Born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Bergoglio worked for a time as a bouncer and a janitor as a young man before training to be a chemist and working as a technician in a food science laboratory. After recovering from a severe illness, he was inspired to join the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits) in 1958. He was ordained a Catholic priest in 1969, and from 1973 to 1979 was the Jesuit provincial superior in Argentina. He became the archbishop of Buenos Aires in 1998 and was created a cardinal in 2001 by Pope John Paul II. He led the Argentine Church during the December 2001 riots in Argentina. The administrations of Néstor Kirchner and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner considered him to be a political rival. Following the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI on 28 February 2013, a papal conclave elected Bergoglio as his successor on 13 March. He chose Francis as his papal name in honor of Saint Francis of Assisi. Throughout his public life, Francis has been noted for his humility, emphasis on God's mercy, international visibility as pope, concern for the poor, and commitment to interreligious dialogue. He is credited with having a less formal approach to the papacy than his predecessors, for instance choosing to reside in the Domus Sanctae Marthae guesthouse rather than in the papal apartments of the Apostolic Palace used by previous popes.Francis maintains the traditional views of the Church regarding abortion, clerical celibacy, and the ordination of women, but has initiated dialogue on the possibility of deaconesses and has made women full members of dicasteries in the Roman Curia. He maintains that the Church should be more open and welcoming for members of the LGBT community. Francis is an outspoken critic of unbridled capitalism and free market economics, consumerism, and overdevelopment, and advocates taking action on climate change, a focus of his papacy with the promulgation of Laudato si'. In international diplomacy, he helped to restore full diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba and supported the cause of refugees during the European and Central American migrant crises. Since 2018, he has been an opponent of populism. He has faced criticism from theological conservatives on many questions, including his promotion of ecumenism, as well as admitting civilly divorced and remarried Catholics to communion with the publication of Amoris laetitia.Early yearsJorge Mario Bergoglio was born on 17 December 1936 in Flores, a neighborhood of Buenos Aires. He was the eldest of five children of Mario José Bergoglio (1908–1959) and Regina María Sívori (1911–1981). Mario Bergoglio was an Italian immigrant accountant born in Portacomaro (Province of Asti) in Italy's Piedmont region. Regina Sívori was a housewife born in Buenos Aires to a family of northern Italian (Piedmontese-Genoese) origin. Mario José's family left Italy in 1929 to escape the fascist rule of Benito Mussolini. According to María Elena Bergoglio (b. 1948), the pope's only living sibling, they did not emigrate for economic reasons. His other siblings were Alberto Horacio (1942–2010), Oscar Adrián (1938–deceased) and Marta Regina (1940–2007). Two great-nephews, Antonio and Joseph, died in a traffic collision. His niece, Cristina Bergoglio, is a painter based in Madrid, Spain.In the sixth grade, Bergoglio attended Wilfrid Barón de los Santos Ángeles, a school of the Salesians of Don Bosco, in Ramos Mejía, Buenos Aires Province. He attended the technical secondary school Escuela Técnica Industrial N° 27 Hipólito Yrigoyen, named after a past Argentine president, and graduated with a chemical technician's diploma (not a master's degree in chemistry, as some media outlets incorrectly reported). In that capacity, he spent several years working in the food section of Hickethier-Bachmann Laboratory, where he worked under Esther Ballestrino. Prior to working as a chemical technician, Bergoglio had also worked as a bar bouncer and as a janitor sweeping floors.When he was 21 years old, he suffered from life-threatening pneumonia and three cysts. He had part of a lung excised shortly afterwards. Bergoglio has been a lifelong supporter of San Lorenzo de Almagro football club. Bergoglio is also a fan of the films of Tita Merello, neorealism, and tango dancing, with a fondness for the traditional music of Argentina and Uruguay known as the milonga.Jesuit (1958–2013)Bergoglio found his vocation to the priesthood while he was on his way to celebrate the Spring Day. He passed by a church to go to confession, and was inspired by the priest. Bergoglio studied at the archdiocesan seminary, Inmaculada Concepción Seminary, in Villa Devoto, Buenos Aires, and, after three years, entered the Society of Jesus as a novice on 11 March 1958. Bergoglio has said that, as a young seminarian, he had a crush on a girl he met and briefly doubted about continuing the religious career. As a Jesuit novice he studied humanities in Santiago, Chile. After his novitiate in the Society of Jesus, Bergoglio officially became a Jesuit on 12 March 1960, when he made the religious profession of the initial, perpetual vows of poverty, chastity and obedience of a member of the order.In 1960, Bergoglio obtained a licentiate in philosophy from the Colegio Máximo de San José in San Miguel, Buenos Aires Province. He taught literature and psychology at the Colegio de la Inmaculada Concepción, a high school in Santa Fe, from 1964 to 1965. In 1966, he taught the same courses at the Colegio del Salvador in Buenos Aires.Presbyterate (1969–1992)In 1967 Bergoglio began his theological studies at Facultades de Filosofía y Teología de San Miguel and on 13 December 1969 was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop Ramón José Castellano. He served as the master of novices for the province there and became a professor of theology.Bergoglio completed his final stage of spiritual training as a Jesuit, tertianship, at Alcalá de Henares, Spain, and took final, solemn vows as a Jesuit, including the fourth vow of obedience to missioning by the pope, on 22 April 1973. He was named provincial superior of the Society of Jesus in Argentina that July, for a six-year term which ended in 1979. In 1973, shortly after being named provincial superior, he had made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem but his stay was shortened by the outbreak of the Yom Kippur War. After the completion of his term of office, in 1980 he was named the rector of the Philosophical and Theological Faculty of San Miguel where he had studied. Before taking up this new appointment, he spent the first three months of 1980 in Ireland to learn English, staying at the Jesuit Centre at the Milltown Institute of Theology and Philosophy, Dublin. He served at San Miguel for six years until 1986 when, at the discretion of Jesuit superior-general Peter Hans Kolvenbach, he was replaced by someone more in tune with the worldwide trend in the Society of Jesus toward emphasizing social justice, rather than his emphasis on popular religiosity and direct pastoral work.He spent several months at the Sankt Georgen Graduate School of Philosophy and Theology in Frankfurt, Germany, considering possible dissertation topics. He settled on exploring the work of the German / Italian theologian Romano Guardini, particularly his study of 'Contrast' published in his 1925 work Der Gegensatz. However, he was to return to Argentina prematurely to serve as a confessor and spiritual director to the Jesuit community in Córdoba. In Germany, he saw the painting Mary, Untier of Knots in Augsburg and brought a copy of the painting to Argentina where it has become an important Marian devotion. As a student at the Salesian school, Bergoglio was mentored by Ukrainian Greek Catholic priest Stefan Czmil. Bergoglio often rose hours before his classmates to serve Mass for Czmil.Bergoglio was asked in 1992 by Jesuit authorities not to reside in Jesuit houses, because of continued tensions with Jesuit leaders and scholars, a sense of Bergoglio's 'dissent,' views of his Catholic orthodoxy and his opposition to theology of liberation, and his work as auxiliary bishop of Buenos Aires. As a bishop he was no longer subject to his Jesuit superior. From then on, he did not visit Jesuit houses and was in 'virtual estrangement from the Jesuits' until after his election as pope.Pre-papal episcopate (1992–2013)Bergoglio was named Auxiliary Bishop of Buenos Aires in 1992 and consecrated on 27 June 1992 as titular bishop of Auca, with Cardinal Antonio Quarracino, archbishop of Buenos Aires, serving as principal consecrator. He chose as his episcopal motto Miserando atque eligendo. It is drawn from Saint Bede's homily on Matthew 9:9–13: 'because he saw him through the eyes of mercy and chose him'.On 3 June 1997, Bergoglio was appointed coadjutor archbishop of Buenos Aires with right of succession. Upon Quarracino's death on 28 February 1998, Bergoglio became metropolitan archbishop of Buenos Aires. In that role, Bergoglio created new parishes and restructured the archdiocese administrative offices, led pro-life initiatives, and created a commission on divorces. One of Bergoglio's major initiatives as archbishop was to increase the Church's presence in the slums of Buenos Aires. Under his leadership, the number of priests assigned to work in the slums doubled. This work led to him being called the 'Slum Bishop'.Early in his time as archbishop of Buenos Aires, Bergoglio sold off the archdiocese's shares in multiple banks and turned its accounts into those of a normal customer in international banks. The shares in banks had led the local church to a propensity towards high spending, and the archdiocese was nearing bankruptcy as a result. As a normal customer of the bank, the church was forced into a higher fiscal discipline.On 6 November 1998, while remaining archbishop of Buenos Aires, he was named ordinary for those Eastern Catholics in Argentina who lacked a prelate of their own church. Major Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk said that Bergoglio understands the liturgy, rites, and spirituality of Shevchuk's Greek Catholic Church and always 'took care of our Church in Argentina' as ordinary for Eastern Catholics during his time as archbishop of Buenos Aires.In 2000, Bergoglio was the only church official to reconcile with Jerónimo Podestá, a former bishop who had been suspended as a priest after opposing the Argentine Revolution military dictatorship in 1972. He defended Podestá's wife from Vatican attacks on their marriage. That same year, Bergoglio said the Argentine Catholic Church needed 'to put on garments of public penance for the sins committed during the years of the dictatorship' in the 1970s, during the Dirty War.Bergoglio made it his custom to celebrate the Holy Thursday ritual washing of feet in places such as jails, hospitals, retirement homes or slums. In 2007, just two days after Benedict XVI issued new rules for using the liturgical forms that preceded the Second Vatican Council, Cardinal Bergoglio established a fixed place for a weekly Mass in this extraordinary form of the Roman Rite. It was celebrated weekly.On 8 November 2005, Bergoglio was elected president of the Argentine Episcopal Conference for a three-year term (2005–08). He was reelected to another three-year term on 11 November 2008. He remained a member of that commission's permanent governing body, president of its committee for the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina, and a member of its liturgy committee for the care of shrines. While head of the Argentine Catholic bishops' conference, Bergoglio issued a collective apology for his church's failure to protect people from the Junta during the Dirty War. When he turned 75 in December 2011, Bergoglio submitted his resignation as archbishop of Buenos Aires to Pope Benedict XVI as required by canon law. Still, as he had no coadjutor archbishop, he stayed in office, waiting for an eventual replacement appointed by the Vatican.Cardinalate (2001–2013)At the consistory of 21 February 2001, Archbishop Bergoglio was created a cardinal by Pope John Paul II with the title of cardinal priest of San Roberto Bellarmino, a church served by Jesuits and named for one; he was formally installed in that church the following 14 October. When he traveled to Rome for the ceremony, he and his sister María Elena visited the village in northern Italy where their father was born. As cardinal, Bergoglio was appointed to five administrative positions in the Roman Curia. He was a member of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, the Congregation for the Clergy, the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life, the Pontifical Council for the Family and the Commission for Latin America. Later that year, when Cardinal Edward Egan returned to New York following the September 11 attacks, Bergoglio replaced him as relator (recording secretary) in the Synod of Bishops, and, according to the Catholic Herald, created 'a favourable impression as a man open to communion and dialogue'.Cardinal Bergoglio became known for personal humility, doctrinal conservatism, and a commitment to social justice. A simple lifestyle contributed to his reputation for humility. He lived in a small apartment, rather than in the elegant bishop's residence in the suburb of Olivos. He took public transportation and cooked his own meals. He limited his time in Rome to 'lightning visits'. He was known to be devoted to St. Thérèse of Lisieux, and he enclosed a small picture of her in the letters he wrote, calling her 'a great missionary saint'.After Pope John Paul II died on 2 April 2005, Bergoglio attended his funeral and was considered one of the papabile for succession to the papacy. He participated as a cardinal elector in the 2005 papal conclave that elected Pope Benedict XVI. In the National Catholic Reporter, John L. Allen Jr. reported that Bergoglio was a frontrunner in the 2005 conclave. In September 2005, the Italian magazine Limes published claims that Bergoglio had been the runner-up and main challenger to Cardinal Ratzinger at that conclave and that he had received 40 votes in the third ballot, but fell back to 26 at the fourth and decisive ballot. The claims were based on a diary purportedly belonging to an anonymous cardinal who had been present at the conclave. According to the Italian journalist Andrea Tornielli, this number of votes had no precedent for a Latin American papabile. La Stampa reported that Bergoglio was in close contention with Ratzinger during the election, until he made an emotional plea that the cardinals should not vote for him. According to Tornielli, Bergoglio made this request to prevent the conclave from delaying too much in the election of a pope.As a cardinal, Bergoglio was associated with Communion and Liberation, a Catholic evangelical lay movement of the type known as associations of the faithful. He sometimes made appearances at the annual gathering known as the Rimini Meeting held during the late summer months in Italy. In 2005, Cardinal Bergoglio authorized the request for beatification—the third step towards sainthood—for six members of the Pallottine community murdered in the San Patricio Church massacre. At the same time, Bergoglio ordered an investigation into the murders themselves, which had been widely blamed on the National Reorganization Process, the military junta that ruled Argentina at the time.Relations with Argentine governmentsDirty WarBergoglio was the subject of allegations regarding the Navy's kidnapping of two Jesuit priests, Orlando Yorio and Franz Jalics, in May 1976, during Argentina's Dirty War. He feared for the priests' safety and had tried to change their work prior to their arrest; however, contrary to reports, he never tried to throw them out of the Jesuit order. In 2005, Myriam Bregman, a human rights lawyer, filed a criminal complaint against Bergoglio, as superior in the Society of Jesus of Argentina, accusing him of involvement in the kidnapping. Her complaint did not specify how Bergoglio was involved; Bergoglio's spokesman flatly denied the allegations. The lawsuit was ultimately dismissed. The priests were tortured, but were found alive five months later, drugged and semi-naked. Yorio accused Bergoglio of effectively handing them over to the death squads by declining to tell the authorities that he endorsed their work. Yorio, who died in 2000, said in a 1999 interview that he believed that Bergoglio did nothing 'to free us, in fact just the opposite'. Jalics initially refused to discuss the complaint after moving into seclusion in a German monastery. However, two days after the election of Francis, Jalics issued a statement confirming the kidnapping and attributing the cause to a former lay colleague who became a guerrilla, was captured, then named Yorio and Jalics when interrogated. The following week, Jalics issued a second, clarifying statement: 'It is wrong to assert that our capture took place at the initiative of Father Bergoglio (…) the fact is, Orlando Yorio and I were not denounced by Father Bergoglio.'Bergoglio told his authorized biographer, Sergio Rubin, that after the priests' imprisonment, he worked behind the scenes for their release; Bergoglio's intercession with dictator Jorge Rafael Videla on their behalf may have saved their lives. Bergoglio also told Rubin that he had often sheltered people from the dictatorship on church property, and once gave his own identity papers to a man who looked like him, so he could flee Argentina. The interview with Rubin, reflected in the biography El jesuita, is the only time Bergoglio has spoken to the press about those events. Alicia Oliveira, a former Argentine judge, has also reported that Bergoglio helped people flee Argentina during the rule of the junta. Since Francis became pope, Gonzalo Mosca and José Caravias have related to journalists accounts of how Bergoglio helped them flee the Argentine dictatorship.Oliveira described the future pope as 'anguished' and 'very critical of the dictatorship' during the Dirty War. Oliveira met with him at the time and urged Bergoglio to speak out—he told her that 'he couldn't. That it wasn't an easy thing to do.' Artist and human rights activist Adolfo Pérez Esquivel, the 1980 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, said: 'Perhaps he didn't have the courage of other priests, but he never collaborated with the dictatorship. …Bergoglio was no accomplice of the dictatorship.' Graciela Fernández Meijide, member of the Permanent Assembly for Human Rights, also said that there was no proof linking Bergoglio with the dictatorship. She told the Clarín newspaper: 'There is no information and Justice couldn't prove it. I was in the APDH during all the dictatorship years and I received hundreds of testimonies. Bergoglio was never mentioned. It was the same in the CONADEP. Nobody mentioned him as instigator or as anything.' Ricardo Lorenzetti, President of the Argentine Supreme Court, also has said that Bergoglio is 'completely innocent' of the accusations. Historian Uki Goñi pointed that, during early 1976, the military junta still had a good image among society, and that the scale of the political repression was not known until much later; Bergoglio would have had little reason to suspect that the detention of Yorio and Jalics could end up in their deaths.When Bergoglio became pope, an alleged photo of him giving the sacramental bread to dictator Jorge Rafael Videla became popular in social networks. It has also been used by the newspaper Página/12. The photo was soon proved to be false. It was revealed that the priest, whose face is not visible in the photo, was Carlos Berón de Astrada. The photo was taken at the church 'Pequeña Obra de la Divina Providencia Don Orione' in 1990, not during the Dirty War, and after Videla's presidential pardon. The photo was produced by the agency AFP and it was initially published by the Crónica newspaper.Fernando de la RúaFernando de la Rúa replaced Carlos Menem as president of Argentina in 1999. As an archbishop, Bergoglio celebrated the annual Mass at the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral on the First National Government holiday, 25 May. In 2000, Bergoglio criticized the perceived apathy of society. Argentina faced an economic depression at the time, and the Church criticized the fiscal austerity of the government, which increased poverty. De la Rúa asked the Church to promote a dialogue between the leaders of economic and political sectors to find a solution for the crisis. He claims that he talked with Bergoglio and proposed to take part in the meeting, but Bergoglio would have told him that the meeting was canceled because of a misunderstanding by De la Rúa's assistant, who may have declined the president's assistance. Bishop Jorge Casaretto considers it unlikely, as De la Rúa only made the request in newspaper interviews, but never made a formal request to the Church.The Justicialist Party won the 2001 elections and got the majority in the Congress, and appointed Ramón Puerta as president of the Senate. As vice president Carlos Álvarez resigned shortly before, this left an opposing party second in the order of precedence. Bergoglio asked for an interview with Puerta, and had a positive impression of him. Puerta told him that the Justicialist party was not plotting to oust De la Rúa, and promised to help the president promote the laws that may be required.During police repression of the riots of December 2001, he contacted the Ministry of the Interior and asked that the police distinguish rioters and vandals from peaceful protesters.Néstor and Cristina KirchnerWhen Bergoglio celebrated Mass at the cathedral for the 2004 First National Government holiday, President Néstor Kirchner attended and heard Bergoglio request more political dialogue, reject intolerance, and criticize exhibitionism and strident announcements. Kirchner celebrated the national day elsewhere the following year and the Mass in the cathedral was suspended. In 2006, Bergoglio helped the fellow Jesuit Joaquín Piña to win the elections in the Misiones Province and prevent an amendment of the local constitution that would allow indefinite re-elections. Kirchner intended to use that project to start similar amendments at other provinces, and eventually to the national constitution. Kirchner considered Bergoglio as a political rival to the day he died in October 2010. Bergoglio's relations with Kirchner's widow and successor, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, have been similarly tense. In 2008, Bergoglio called for national reconciliation during disturbances in the country's agricultural regions, which the government interpreted as a support for anti-government demonstrators. The campaign to enact same-sex marriage legislation was a particularly tense period in their relations.When Bergoglio was elected pope, the initial reactions were mixed. Most of the Argentine society cheered it, but the pro-government newspaper Página/12 published renewed allegations about the Dirty War, and the president of the National Library described a global conspiracy theory. The president took more than an hour before congratulating the new pope, and only did so in a passing reference within a routine speech. However, due to the pope's popularity in Argentina, Cristina Kirchner made what the political analyst Claudio Fantini called a 'Copernican shift' in her relations with him and fully embraced the Francis phenomenon. On the day before his inauguration as pope, Bergoglio, now Francis, had a private meeting with Kirchner. They exchanged gifts and lunched together. This was the new pope's first meeting with a head of state, and there was speculation that the two were mending their relations. Página/12 removed their controversial articles about Bergoglio, written by Horacio Verbitsky, from their web page, as a result of this change.Papacy (2013–present)Elected at 76 years old, Francis was reported to be healthy and his doctors have said his missing lung tissue, removed in his youth, does not significantly affect his health. The only concern would be decreased respiratory reserve if he had a respiratory infection. In the past, one attack of sciatica in 2007 prevented him from attending a consistory and delayed his return to Argentina for several days. Francis is the first Jesuit pope. This was a significant appointment, because of the sometimes tense relations between the Society of Jesus and the Holy See. However, Bergoglio came in second to Cardinal Ratzinger on all the ballots in the 2005 conclave, and at the time appeared as the only other viable candidate. He is also the first from the Americas, and the first from the Southern Hemisphere. Many media reported him as being the first non-European pope, but he is actually the 11th; the previous was Gregory III from Syria, who died in 741. Moreover, although Francis was not born in Europe, he is ethnically European; his father and both of his mother's parents are from northern Italy.As pope, his manner is less formal than that of his immediate predecessors: a style that news coverage has referred to as 'no frills', noting that it is 'his common touch and accessibility that is proving the greatest inspiration.' On the night of his election, he took a bus back to his hotel with the cardinals, rather than be driven in the papal car. The next day, he visited Cardinal Jorge María Mejía in the hospital and chatted with patients and staff. At his first media audience, the Saturday after his election, the pope explained his papal name choice, citing Saint Francis of Assisi as 'the man who gives us this spirit of peace, the poor man', and he added '[h]ow I would like a poor Church, and for the poor'.In addition to his native Spanish, he speaks fluent Italian (the official language of Vatican City and the 'everyday language' of the Holy See) and German. He is also conversant in Latin (the official language of the Holy See), French, Portuguese, and English, and he understands the Piedmontese language and some Genoese.Francis chose not to live in the official papal residence in the Apostolic Palace, but to remain in the Vatican guest house, in a suite in which he can receive visitors and hold meetings. He is the first pope since Pope Pius X to live outside the papal apartments. Francis still appears at the window of the Apostolic Palace for the Sunday Angelus.ElectionBergoglio was elected pope on 13 March 2013, the second day of the 2013 papal conclave, taking the papal name Francis. Francis was elected on the fifth ballot of the conclave. The Habemus papam announcement was delivered by the cardinal protodeacon, Jean-Louis Tauran. Cardinal Christoph Schönborn later said that Bergoglio was elected following two supernatural signs, one in the conclave and hence confidential, and a Latin-American couple of friends of Schönborn who whispered Bergoglio's name in Schönborn's ear; Schönborn commented 'if these people say Bergoglio, that's an indication of the Holy Spirit'.Instead of accepting his cardinals' congratulations while seated on the papal throne, Francis received them standing, reportedly an immediate sign of a changing approach to formalities at the Vatican. During his first appearance as pontiff on the balcony of Saint Peter's Basilica, he wore a white cassock, not the red, ermine-trimmed mozzetta used by previous popes. He also wore the same iron pectoral cross that he had worn as archbishop of Buenos Aires, rather than the gold one worn by his predecessors.After being elected and choosing his name, his first act was bestowing the Urbi et Orbi blessing on thousands of pilgrims gathered in St. Peter's Square. Before blessing the crowd, he asked those in St. Peter's Square to pray for his predecessor, 'the bishop emeritus of Rome' Pope Benedict XVI, and for himself as the new 'bishop of Rome'.Francis held his papal inauguration on 19 March 2013 in St. Peter's Square in the Vatican. He celebrated Mass in the presence of various political and religious leaders from around the world. In his homily Francis focused on the Solemnity of Saint Joseph, the liturgical day on which the Mass was celebrated.NameAt his first audience on 16 March 2013, Francis told journalists that he had chosen the name in honor of Saint Francis of Assisi, and had done so because he was especially concerned for the well-being of the poor. He explained that, as it was becoming clear during the conclave voting that he would be elected the new bishop of Rome, the Brazilian Cardinal Cláudio Hummes had embraced him and whispered, 'Don't forget the poor', which had made Bergoglio think of the saint. Bergoglio had previously expressed his admiration for St. Francis, explaining that 'He brought to Christianity an idea of poverty against the luxury, pride, vanity of the civil and ecclesiastical powers of the time. He changed history.'This is the first time that a pope has been named Francis. On the day of his election, the Vatican clarified that his official papal name was 'Francis', not 'Francis I', i.e. no regnal number is used for him. A Vatican spokesman said that the name would become Francis I if and when there is a Francis II. It is the first time since Lando's 913–914 pontificate that a serving pope holds a name not used by a predecessor.Francis also said that some cardinal electors had jokingly suggested to him that he should choose either 'Adrian', since Adrian VI had been a reformer of the church, or 'Clement' to settle the score with Clement XIV, who had suppressed the Jesuit order. In February 2014, it was reported that Bergoglio, had he been elected in 2005, would have chosen the pontifical name of 'John XXIV' in honor of John XXIII. It was said that he told Cardinal Francesco Marchisano: 'John, I would have called myself John, like the Good Pope; I would have been completely inspired by him'.CuriaOn 16 March 2013, Francis asked all those in senior positions of the Roman Curia to provisionally continue in office. He named Alfred Xuereb as his personal secretary. On 6 April he named José Rodríguez Carballo as secretary for the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life, a position that had been vacant for several months. Francis abolished the bonuses paid to Vatican employees upon the election of a new pope, amounting to several million Euros, opting instead to donate the money to charity. He also abolished the €25,000 annual bonus paid to the cardinals serving on the Board of Supervisors for the Vatican bank.On 13 April 2013, he named eight cardinals to a new Council of Cardinal Advisers to advise him on revising the organizational structure of the Roman Curia. The group included several known as critics of Vatican operations and only one member of the Curia. They are Giuseppe Bertello, president of the Vatican City State governorate; Francisco Javier Errazuriz Ossa from Chile; Oswald Gracias from India; Reinhard Marx from Germany; Laurent Monsengwo Pasinya from the Democratic Republic of the Congo; George Pell from Australia; Seán O'Malley from the United States; and Óscar Andrés Rodríguez Maradiaga from Honduras. He appointed Bishop Marcello Semeraro secretary for the group and scheduled its first meeting for 1–3 October.Early issuesIn March 2013, 21 British Catholic peers and members of Parliament from all parties asked Francis to allow married men in Great Britain to be ordained as priests, keeping celibacy as the rule for bishops. They asked it on the grounds that it would be anomalous that married Anglican priests can be received into the Catholic Church and ordained as priests, by means of either the Pastoral Provision of 20 June 1980 or the 2009 Anglican ordinariate, but married Catholic men cannot do the same.Fouad Twal, the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, included a call in his 2013 Easter homily for the pope to visit Jerusalem. Louis Raphael I, the Chaldean Catholic Patriarch, asked the pope to visit the 'embattled Christian community' in Iraq. In March 2021, Pope Francis went to Iraq on a first-ever papal visit to the diminishing Christian communities of Mesopotamia fallen apart after years of conflict.On the first Holy Thursday following his election, Francis washed and kissed the feet of ten male and two female juvenile offenders, not all Catholic, aged from 14 to 21, imprisoned at Rome's Casal del Marmo detention facility, telling them the ritual of foot washing is a sign that he is at their service. This was the first time that a pope had included women in this ritual; although he had already done so when he was archbishop. One of the male and one of the female prisoners were Muslim.On 31 March 2013, Francis used his first Easter homily to make a plea for peace throughout the world, specifically mentioning the Middle East, Africa, and North and South Korea. He also spoke out against those who give in to 'easy gain' in a world filled with greed, and made a plea for humanity to become a better guardian of creation by protecting the environment. He said that '[w]e ask the risen Jesus, who turns death into life, to change hatred into love, vengeance into forgiveness, war into peace.' Although the Vatican had prepared greetings in 65 languages, Francis chose not to read them. According to the Vatican, the pope 'at least for now, feels at ease using Italian, the everyday language of the Holy See'.In 2013, Francis initially reaffirmed the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith's program to reform the U.S. Leadership Conference of Women Religious, initiated under his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI. The New York Times reported that the Vatican had formed the opinion in 2012 that the sisters' group was tinged with feminist influences, focused too much on ending social and economic injustice and not enough on stopping abortion, and permitted speakers at its meetings who questioned church doctrine. However, in April 2015 the investigation was brought to a close. While the timing of the closure may have anticipated a visit by Francis to the U.S. in September 2015, it was noted that the sisters' emphasis is close to that of Francis.On 12 May, Francis carried out his first canonizations of candidates approved for sainthood during the reign of Benedict XVI: the first Colombian saint, Laura of Saint Catherine of Siena, the second female Mexican saint, María Guadalupe García Zavala, both of the 20th century, and the 813 15th-century Martyrs of Otranto. He said: 'While we venerate the martyrs of Otranto, ask God to support the many Christians who still suffer from violence and give them the courage and fate and respond to evil with goodness.'Synodal churchFrancis has overseen synods on the family (2014), on youth (2018), and on the Church in the Amazon region (2019). In 2019 Francis' apostolic constitution Episcopalis communio allowed that the final document of a synod may become magisterial teaching simply with papal approval. The constitution also allowed for laity to contribute input directly to the synod's secretary general. Some analysts see the creation of a truly synodal church as likely to become the greatest contribution of Francis' papacy.Consultation with Catholic laityA February 2014 survey by the World Values Survey cited in The Washington Post and Time shows how the unity Francis had created could be challenged. Although views about Francis personally were favorable, many Catholics disagreed with at least some of his teachings. The survey found that members of the Catholic Church are deeply divided over abortion, artificial contraception, divorce, the ordination of women, and married priests. In the same month Francis asked parishes to provide answers to an official questionnaire described as a 'much broader consultation than just a survey' regarding opinions among the laity. He continued to assert Catholic doctrine, in less dramatic tone than his recent predecessors, who maintained that the Catholic Church is not a democracy of popular opinion.Linda Woodhead of Lancaster University wrote of the survey Francis initiated, 'it's not a survey in any sense that a social scientist would recognize.' Woodhead said that many ordinary Catholics would have difficulty understanding theological jargon there. Nonetheless, she suspected the survey might be influential.The Catholic Church in England and Waleshad refused to publish results of this survey; a Church spokesman said a senior Vatican official had expressly asked for summaries to remain confidential, and that orders had come from the pope that the information should not be made public until after October. This disappointed many reformers who hoped the laity would be more involved in decision-making. Some other Catholic churches, for example in Germany and Austria, published summaries of the responses to the survey, which showed a wide gap between Church teaching and the behavior of ordinary Catholics.In a column he wrote for the Vatican's semi-official newspaper L'Osservatore Romano, the then-Prefect of the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura, American cardinal Raymond Leo Burke, who has a long-standing reputation as one of the church's most vocal conservative hard-liners, said that Francis opposed both abortion and gay marriage. The Vatican's chief spokesman, Father Federico Lombardi, also noted in the Vatican press office during the 2014 consistory meetings that Francis and Cardinal Walter Kasper would not change or redefine any dogmas pertaining to Church theology on doctrinal matters.Institute for the Works of ReligionIn the first months of Francis's papacy, the Institute for the Works of Religion, informally known as the Vatican Bank, said that it would become more transparent in its financial dealings There had long been allegations of corruption and money laundering connected with the bank. Francis appointed a commission to advise him about reform of the Bank, and the finance consulting firm Promontory Financial Group was assigned to carry out a comprehensive investigation of all customer contacts of the bank on these facts. Because of this affair the Promoter of Justice at the Vatican Tribunal applied a letter rogatory for the first time in the history of the Republic of Italy at the beginning of August 2013. In January 2014, Francis replaced four of the five cardinal overseers of the Vatican Bank, who had been confirmed in their positions in the final days of Benedict XVI's papacy. Lay experts and clerics were looking into how the bank was run. Ernst von Freyberg was put in charge. Moneyval feels more reform is needed, and Francis may be willing to close the bank if the reforms prove too difficult. There is uncertainty how far reforms can succeed.Papal documentsOn 29 June 2013, Francis published the encyclical Lumen fidei, which was largely the work of Benedict XVI but awaiting a final draft at his retirement. On 24 November 2013, Francis published his first major letter as pope, the apostolic exhortation Evangelii gaudium, which he described as the programmatic of his papacy. On 18 June 2015, he published his first own, original encyclical Laudato si' concerning care for the planet. On 8 April 2016, Francis published his second apostolic exhortation, Amoris laetitia, remarking on love within the family. Controversy arose at the end of 2016 when four cardinals formally asked Francis for clarifications, particularly on the issue of giving communion to divorced and civilly remarried Catholics.His motu proprios include Ai nostri tempi and De concordia inter codices. Francis issued another titled Maiorem hac dilectionem which created a new path towards canonization for certain causes.He established two new Secretariats (top-level departments) in the Roman Curia: the Secretariat for the Economy, and the Secretariat for Communications. He simplified the process for declaring matrimonial nullity.On 8 December 2017, Francis signed a new apostolic constitution on ecclesiastical universities and faculties Veritatis gaudium, published 29 January 2018.A further Apostolic Exhortation, Gaudete et exsultate (Rejoice and be glad), was published on 19 March 2018, dealing with 'the call to holiness in today's world' for all persons. He counters contemporary versions of the gnostic and Pelagian heresies and describes how Jesus' beatitudes call people to 'go against the flow'.In February 2019, Francis acknowledged that priests and bishops were sexually abusing religious sisters. He addressed this and the clergy sex abuse scandal by convening a summit on clergy sexual abuse in Rome 21–24 February 2019. As a follow-up to that summit, on 9 May 2019 Francis promulgated the motu proprio Vos estis lux mundi which specified responsibilities, including reporting directly to the Holy See on bishops and on one's superior, while simultaneously involving another bishop in the archdiocese of the accused bishop.On 30 September 2020, he published the apostolic letter Scripturae sacrae affectus to celebrate the 16th centenary of the death of Jerome.On 4 October 2020 on the feast of St. Francis of Assisi, Francis published the encyclical Fratelli tutti on fraternity and social friendship, using St. Francis' own words to describe our universal brotherhood and sisterhood.On 8 December 2020 on the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, Pope Francis published the apostolic letter Patris corde ('With a Father's Heart'). To mark the occasion, the Pope proclaimed a 'Year of Saint Joseph' from 8 December 2020, to 8 December 2021 on the 150th Anniversary of the Proclamation of Saint Joseph as Patron of the Universal Church.On 1 June 2021, Francis published the apostolic constitution Pascite gregem Dei.Pope Francis issued the motu proprio Traditionis custodes on 16 July 2021. The document abrogated the permissions for the celebration of the Tridentine Mass previously established by Benedict XVI in the 2007 Summorum Pontificum, with Traditionis custodes instituting increased restrictions on the use of the 1962 Roman Missal. Pope Francis stated in a letter accompanying the motu proprio that emphasizing the Mass of Paul VI would bring 'unity I intend to re-establish throughout the Church of the Roman Rite.'Ecumenism and interreligious dialoguePope Francis continued in the tradition of the Second Vatican Council and of the papacies since the Council in promoting ecumenism with other Christian denominations, as well as encouraging dialogue with leaders of other religions; he has also supported peace with those claiming no religious belief.Clerical titlesIn January 2014, Francis said that he would appoint fewer monsignors and only assign those honored to the lowest of the three surviving ranks of monsignor, chaplain of His Holiness. It would be awarded only to diocesan priests at least 65 years old. During his 15 years as archbishop of Buenos Aires, Francis never sought the title for any of his priests. It is believed he associates it with clerical careerism and hierarchy, though he did not apply this restriction to clergy working in the Roman Curia or diplomatic corps, where careerism is an even greater concern.Canonizations and beatificationsFrancis presided over the first canonizations of his pontificate on 12 May 2013 in which he canonized the Martyrs of Otranto. Antonio Primaldo and his 812 companions who had been executed by the Ottomans in 1480, as well as the religious sisters Laura of St. Catherine of Siena and María Guadalupe García Zavala – in this first canonization he surpassed the record of Pope John Paul II in canonizing the most saints in a pontificate. Francis approved the equipollent canonization of Angela of Foligno the following 9 October and then the Jesuit Peter Faber the following 17 December.The pope approved further equipollent canonizations on 3 April 2014 for the Jesuit José de Anchieta as well as the Ursuline nun Marie of the Incarnation and bishop François de Laval. Francis canonized his two predecessors John XXIII and John Paul II on 27 April 2014 and canonized six additional saints the following 23 November. The pope canonized Joseph Vaz on his visit to Sri Lanka on 14 January 2015 and canonized a further four saints on the following 17 May; he canonized Junípero Serra on 23 September while visiting the United States and then canonized four saints on 18 October including the first married couple to be named as saints. Francis canonized Maria Elisabeth Hesselblad and Stanislaus Papczyński on 5 June 2016 and then canonized Teresa of Calcutta on 4 September; he canonized seven additional saints on 16 October. The pope canonized the two child visionaries Francisco and Jacinta Marto during his visit to Fátima in mid-2017 and canonized 35 additional saints on 15 October. Francis recognized seven saints on 14 October 2018, chief among them, his predecessor Pope Paul VI and Óscar Romero. Francis later confirmed the equipollent canonization for Bartholomew of Braga in mid-2019. On 13 October 2019, Francis canonized five new saints, including Cardinal John Henry Newman. The pope confirmed the equipollent canonization for Margherita della Metola on 24 April 2021.The pope has also continued the practice of having beatifications celebrated in the place of the individual's origin though has presided over beatifications himself on three occasions: for Paul Yun Ji-Chung and 123 companions on 16 August 2014, his predecessor Pope Paul VI on 19 October 2014, and two Colombian martyrs on 8 September 2017. The pope has approved beatifications for a range of men and women including the likes of Álvaro del Portillo of Opus Dei (27 September 2014), the martyred archbishop Óscar Romero (23 May 2015), the prominent Polish cardinal Stefan Wyszyński (12 September 2021), and several large groups of Spanish martyrs.Francis also confirmed his predecessor John Paul I to be Venerable on 8 November 2017.Doctors of the ChurchOn 21 February 2015, Francis signed a decree naming Saint Gregory of Narek as the 36th Doctor of the Church; he formally conferred the title upon the saint at a ceremony held in Saint Peter's Basilica on 12 April 2015 with delegations from the Armenian Catholic Church and the Armenian Apostolic Church present. On 20 January 2022, Francis provided his approval to the suggestion to name Saint Irenaeus of Lyon as the 37th Doctor of the Church, formally conferring the title upon him, along with the supplementary title Doctor unitatis ('Doctor of Unity') in a decree issued on 21 January.ConsistoriesAt the first consistory of his papacy, held on 22 February 2014, Francis created 19 new cardinals. At the time of their elevation to that rank, 16 of these new cardinals were under eighty years of age and thus eligible to vote in a papal conclave. The new appointees included prelates from South America, Africa, and Asia, including appointees in some of the world's poorest countries, such as Chibly Langlois from Haiti and Philippe Nakellentuba Ouedraogo from Burkina Faso. The consistory was a rare occasion in which Francis and his predecessor, Benedict XVI, appeared together in public.Benedict XVI also attended the second consistory on 14 February 2015, at which Francis elevated 20 new cardinals, with 15 under the age of eighty and five over the age of eighty. The pope continued his practice of appointing cardinals from the peripheries, such as Charles Maung Bo of Myanmar and Soane Patita Paini Mafi of Tonga.Francis presided over the third consistory of his papacy on 19 November 2016, elevating 17 new cardinals. Of that total number at the time of their elevation, 13 were under the age of eighty and four were over the age of eighty. Francis continued his previous practice of elevating cardinals from the peripheries with an emphasis again on Asia and Africa, such as Patrick D'Rozario from Bangladesh and Dieudonné Nzapalainga from the Central African Republic, while also naming the first three American cardinals of his papacy and only one Curial appointment.The pope presided over a fourth consistory for the elevation of five new cardinals on the afternoon of 28 June 2017. Each of the five were under the age of eighty, and were thus eligible to vote in a papal conclave. This consistory was noteworthy for the fact that, with the pope continuing the trend of elevating cardinals from a diverse range of areas, no cardinals elevated are of the Roman Curia, and one was a mere auxiliary bishop.Francis presided over his fifth consistory for the elevation of 14 new cardinals on 28 June 2018. The first eleven were under the age of eighty, and therefore, were eligible to vote in a future papal conclave while the last three were over the age of eighty, and thus, ineligible to vote in a papal conclave. The pope continued the practice of naming the Vicar of Rome and a curial prefect as cardinals, while naming his substitute for the Secretariat of State in anticipation of his transferral to a curial department. The pope also continued his practice of bestowing the red hat on those from peripheries such as Madagascar, Pakistan, and Iraq, and like in 2016, created a priest as a cardinal. The consistory was also noteworthy for the fact that Francis named the papal almoner Konrad Krajewski as a cardinal, marking the consistory the first occasion where the almoner was made a cardinal. Francis himself later said that he wanted the office of almoner to receive the red hat going forward as it was an important arm of the Vatican.On 1 September 2019, following his weekly Sunday Angelus address, Francis unexpectedly announced the appointment of 13 new cardinals. Of these, 10 appointees were under the age of 80 and would therefore become cardinal electors, besides three over 80. The new cardinals were formally installed at the consistory celebrated on 5 October 2019. Most of the new cardinals come from the peripheries of the church and developing countries. Two new appointees were from Muslim majority countries (Morocco and Indonesia), while two others were known for their work on refugee and migration issues. This action took the number of cardinal electors appointed by Francis to the College of Cardinals to about 70 out of nearly 130.Francis created thirteen new cardinals on 28 November 2020; nine appointees were under the age of 80, therefore, could vote in a future papal conclave. The pope also nominated four cardinals over the age of 80. Most of these new appointees continued the trend that Francis adhered to, appointing the first cardinals to represent Brunei and Rwanda. Francis also nominated the first African American cardinal (Gregory), while naming the first Conventual Franciscan (Gambetti) in almost 160 years, and the first from Siena (Lojudice) since 1801. Three of his appointees were only priests upon their nomination, therefore, two (Gambetti and Feroci) received their episcopal consecration, while one (Cantalamessa) was granted a papal dispensation from it.Year of MercyWith his April 2015 papal bull of indiction, Misericordiae Vultus (Latin: 'The Face of Mercy'), Francis inaugurated a Special Jubilee Year of Mercy, to run from 8 December 2015, Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary, to the last Sunday before Advent and the Solemnity of the Feast of Christ the King of the Universe on 20 November 2016.The Holy Doors of the major basilicas of Rome (including the Great Door of St. Peter's) were opened, and special 'Doors of Mercy' were opened at cathedrals and other major churches around the world, where the faithful can earn indulgences by fulfilling the usual conditions of prayer for the pope's intentions, confession, and detachment from sin, and communion. During Lent of that year, special 24-hour penance services will be celebrated, and during the year, special qualified and experienced priests called 'Missionaries of Mercy' will be available in every diocese to forgive even severe, special-case sins normally reserved to the Holy See's Apostolic Penitentiary.Francis established the World Day of the Poor in his Apostolic Letter, Misericordia et Misera, issued on 20 November 2016 to celebrate the end of the Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy.COVID-19 pandemicDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Francis canceled his regular general audiences at St. Peter's Square to prevent crowds from gathering and spreading the virus, which seriously affected Italy. He encouraged priests to visit patients and health workers; urged the faithful not to forget the poor during the time of crisis; offered prayers for victims of the virus in China; and invoked the Blessed Virgin Mary under her title Salus Populi Romani, as the Diocese of Rome observed a period of prayer and fasting in recognition of the victims. The pontiff reacted with displeasure on 13 March 2020, at the news that the Vicar General had closed all churches in the Diocese of Rome. Despite Italy being under a quarantine lockdown, Francis pleaded 'not to leave the ... people alone' and worked to partially reverse the closures.On 20 March 2020, Francis asked the Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development (DPIHD) to create a Vatican COVID-19 Commission to express the Church's concern for the crisis generated by the COVID-19 pandemic, and propose responses to the potential socio-economic challenges deriving from it.On 27 March, Francis gave an extraordinary benediction Urbi et Orbi. In his homily on calming the storm in the Gospel of Mark, Francis described the setting: 'Dense darkness has thickened on our squares, streets and cities; it looks over our lives filling everything with a deafening silence and a desolate void that paralyzes everything in its passage: you can feel it in the air, you can feel it in your gestures. ...In the face of suffering, where the true development of our peoples is measured, we discover and experience the priestly prayer of Jesus: 'may all be one'.'Francis maintains getting COVID vaccination is a moral obligation.Francis stated that people had a responsibility to look after themselves, “and this translates into respect for the health of those around us. Health care is a moral obligation”, he stated.<ref>Pope Francis has said getting vaccinated against coronavirus is a “moral obligation” and denounced how naysayers had been swayed by “baseless information”. The Guardian;;</ref>Russo-Ukrainian WarFollowing the February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War, Francis visited the Russian embassy in Rome in what was described as an 'unprecedented move.' Francis called Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, stating his 'sorrow' as the Vatican worked to find 'room for negotiation.' As the invasion began, the major archbishop of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church Sviatoslav Shevchuk cancelled a trip to visit Francis in Florence. On 25 February, the day after the invasion began, Francis would assure Shevchuk via a phone call that 'he would do everything he can to help end the Ukraine conflict.' During the 27 February Angelus address, Francis called for peace, saying, 'Silence the weapons!'Role of womenOn 11 January 2021, Francis allowed bishops to institute women to the ministries of acolyte and lector. While these instituted ministries were previously reserved to men, Catholic women already carry out these duties without institution in most of the world. Francis wrote that these ministries are fundamentally distinct from those reserved to ordained clergy.In February 2021, Francis announced back-to-back appointments of women to take positions that were only held by men in the past. He appointed France’s member of the Xaviere Missionary Sisters, Nathalie Becquart as the first co-undersecretary of the Synod of Bishops. Besides, an Italian magistrate, Catia Summaria also became the first woman Promoter of Justice in the Vatican’s Court of Appeals.Financial corruptionFrancis was mandated by electing cardinals to sort out Vatican finances following scandals during the papacies of Pope Benedict and Pope John Paul II.He stated he is determined to end corruption in the Catholic Church but is not very optimistic due to a human problem dating back centuries.Theological emphasesIn Evangelii gaudium Francis revealed what would be the emphases of his pontificate: a missionary impulse among all Catholics, sharing the faith more actively, avoiding worldliness and more visibly living the gospel of God's mercy, and helping the poor and working for social justice.EvangelizationFrom his first major letter Evangelii gaudium (Joy to the World), Francis called for 'a missionary and pastoral conversion' whereby the laity would fully share in the missionary task of the church. Then in his letter on the call of all to the same holiness, Gaudete et exsultate, Fancis describes holiness as 'an impulse to evangelize and to leave a mark in this world'.Church governanceFrancis called for decentralization of governance away from Rome, and for a synodal manner of decision making in dialogue with the people. He strongly opposed clericalism and made women full members of the Church's dicasteries in Rome.EnvironmentFrancis' naming of himself after Francis of Assisi was an early indication of how he shared Francis' care for all of creation. This was followed in May 2015 with his major encyclical on the environment, Laudato si' (Praise be to you).Option for the poorFrancis has highly extolled 'popular movements', which demonstrate the 'strength of us', serve as a remedy to the 'culture of the self', and are based on solidarity with the poor and the common good.MoralityCardinal Walter Kasper has called mercy 'the key word of his pontificate.' His papal motto Miserando atque eligendo ('by having mercy and by choosing') contains a central theme of his papacy, God's mercy, While maintaining the Church's traditional teaching against abortion, Francis, has referred to the 'obsession' of some Catholics with a few issues like 'abortion, gay marriage and the use of contraceptive methods' which 'do not show the heart of the message of Jesus Christ.”LGBTIn June 2013, Francis suggested that 'if a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?' Later, in 2015, he declared that 'the family is threatened by growing efforts on the part of some to redefine the very institution of marriage.' He has also suggested that same-sex marriage 'disfigures God's plan for creation.'He stated that he supports legally recognising same-sex civil unions in a statement from an interview published in October 2020; this passage was from an interview from 2019, but this passage had been cut from public releases at the time. The statement was also interpreted as supportive of LGBT adoption.What we have to create is a civil union law. That way they are legally covered. They're children of God and have a right to a family. Nobody should be thrown out or be made miserable because of it. However, Vatican later clarified that his comments were taken out of context with two comments to two different questions at different times spliced together in a very misleading way. Francis has never officially pronounced support for gay civil unions. Francis also endorsed the 2015 Slovak same-sex marriage referendum which would have banned same-sex adoptions in the country.In January 2022, Francis said during a weekly audience that parents of gay children should offer support to their children instead of condemning them.Religious persecutionFrancis supported the use of force to stop Islamic militants from attacking religious minorities in Iraq. In January 2018, Francis met with a group of Yazidi refugees in Europe and expressed his support for their right to freely profess their own faith without limitations. In the meeting, he also urged the international community 'not to remain a silent and unresponsive spectator in the face of [your] tragedy.'ControversiesSince 2016, criticism against Francis by theological conservatives has intensified. One commentator has described the conservative resistance against Francis as 'unique in its visibility' in recent Church history. Some have explained the level of disagreement as due to his going beyond theoretical principles to pastoral discernment.Sexual abuse responseAs cardinal, in 2010 Bergoglio commissioned a study which concluded that Father Julio Grassi, a priest convicted of child sexual abuse, was innocent, that his victims were lying, and that the case against him never should have gone to trial. Despite the study, the Supreme Court of Argentina upheld the conviction and 15-year prison sentence against Grassi in March 2017. Francis has admitted that the Church 'arrived late' in dealing with sexual abuse cases. During his papacy, a number of abuse survivors have expressed disappointment in Francis's response to sex abuse in the Church while others have praised him for his actions.In 2015, Francis was criticized for supporting Chilean bishop Juan Barros, who was accused of covering up sex crimes committed against minors. In 2018, Francis acknowledged he had made 'grave errors' in judgment about Barros, apologized to the victims and launched a Vatican investigation that resulted in the resignation of Barros and two other Chilean bishops. In 2018, Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò published an open letter denouncing Francis's handling of sexual abuse allegations against Theodore McCarrick, accusing him of knowing about allegations that McCarrick had committed sexual abuse and failing to take action. Viganò called on the Pope to resign.In November 2021, Francis thanked journalists for their 'mission' on uncovering sex abuse scandals in the Church, adding that it made of the cases 'less obscure (...) to make those who live it less fear it.'Theological disagreementsAmoris laetitia and the communion to the divorced and civilly remarriedOn a theological level, controversy arose after the publication of the apostolic exhortation Amoris laetitia, especially regarding whether the exhortation had changed the Catholic Church's sacramental discipline concerning access to the sacraments of Penance and the Eucharist for divorced couples who have civilly remarried. Francis had written that 'It is important that the divorced who have entered a new union should be made to feel part of the Church.' He called not for 'a new set of general rules, canonical in nature and applicable to all cases,' but 'a responsible personal and pastoral discernment of particular cases.' He went on to say: “It is true that general rules set forth a good which can never be disregarded or neglected, but in their formulation they cannot provide absolutely for all particular situations.”Four cardinals (Raymond Leo Burke, Carlo Caffarra, Walter Brandmüller, and Joachim Meisner) formally asked Francis for clarifications, particularly on the issue of giving communion to divorced and civilly remarried Catholics. They submitted five 'dubia' (doubts), and requested a yes or no answer. Francis has not publicly replied. The exhortation has been implemented in different ways by various bishops around the world.Cardinal Gerhard Müller, former prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, maintained that Amoris Laetitia should only be interpreted in line with previous doctrine. Therefore, according to Cardinal Müller, divorced and civilly remarried can have access to the Sacraments of Reconciliation and the Eucharist only if they take on the duty of living in complete continence. Francis subsequently announced that dicastery prefects would be appointed for a single five-year term, and replaced Müller at the end of his term in 2017 with Luis Ladaria Ferrer. Cardinal Carlo Caffarra, one of the authors of the dubia, maintains that after Amoris laetitia 'only a blind man could deny there's great confusion, uncertainty and insecurity in the Church.'In July 2017 a group of conservative clergy, academics and laymen signed a document labeled as a 'Filial Correction' of Francis. The 25-page document, which was made public in September after it received no reply, criticized the pope for promoting what it described as seven heretical propositions through various words, actions and omissions during his pontificate. Capuchin Father Thomas Weinandy, ex-doctrine chief of US Bishops, wrote a letter to Francis on 31 July 2017, which he subsequently made public, in which he charged that Francis is fostering 'chronic confusion', 'demeaning' the importance of doctrine, appointing bishops who 'scandalize' believers with dubious 'teaching and pastoral practice', giving prelates who object the impression they will be 'marginalized or worse' if they speak out, and causing faithful Catholics to 'lose confidence in their supreme shepherd'.Document on Human FraternityThe Document on Human Fraternity for World Peace and Living Together is a joint statement signed by Francis and Sheikh Ahmed el-Tayeb, Grand Imam of Al-Azhar, on 4 February 2019 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. This joint statement is concerned with how different faiths can live peaceably in the same world and areas. Criticisms focused particularly on the passage about God's will with regard to the diversity of religions, claiming that the 'pluralism and the diversity of religions, colour, sex, race and language are willed by God in His wisdom, through which He created human beings'. Catholic theologian Chad Pecknold wrote that this sentence was 'puzzling, and potentially problematic'. Some Catholic observers tried to understand it as an allusion to the 'permissive will' of God, allowing evil on earth. Pecknold wrote that the diversity of religions might also be 'evidence of our natural desire to know God'. On 8 February 2019 Bishop Athanasius Schneider released a document entitled 'The Gift of Filial Adoption, the Christian Faith: the only valid and the only God-willed religion'.Traditionis custodes and the restriction of the Tridentine MassIn July 2021, Francis issued, motu proprio, the apostolic letter titled Traditionis custodes, which reversed the decision of his immediate predecessor Benedict XVI in Summorum Pontificum and imposed new restrictions on the use of the Traditional Latin Mass. The letter returned to the bishops the power to grant or suppress the Latin Mass in their particular dioceses, and requires newly ordained priests to first request permission before performing the old rite, among other changes. 'Traditionis Custodes, which Pope Francis published and came into immediate effect on July 16, has been criticized by prelates such as Cardinals Raymond Burke, Gerhard Müller and Joseph Zen, as well as many lay faithful who attend the traditional Latin Mass, also called Extraordinary Form of the Roman Rite. The most general criticism is that the restrictions are unnecessary, needlessly harsh, and implemented in an unjustifiably swift fashion.'International policyFrancis has regularly been accused by conservatives of having a 'soft spot' for leftist populist movements. After Francis's visit to Cuba in 2015, Catholic Yale historian Carlos Eire said Francis had a 'preferential option for the oppressors' in Cuba. Nevertheless, Francis remained hostile to right-wing populism.Francis has supported the Vatican-China agreement, intended to normalize the situation of China's Catholics, which was criticized by Cardinal Joseph Zen as a step towards the 'annihilation' of the Catholic Church in China. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said cooperating with the Chinese Communist Party puts the pope's moral authority at risk. In September 2020, Pompeo urged Francis to stand against China's human rights violations. In November, Francis named China's Uyghur minority among a list of the world's persecuted peoples. He wrote: 'I think often of persecuted peoples: the Rohingya [Muslims in Myanmar], the poor Uighurs, the Yazidi—what ISIS did to them was truly cruel—or Christians in Egypt and Pakistan killed by bombs that went off while they prayed in church.' Zhao Lijian, the spokesman of the Foreign Ministry of China, said Francis’ remarks had 'no factual basis at all'.Since 2016, Francis has also been contrasted with US President Donald Trump, elected that year, with some conservative critics drawing comparisons between the two. During the 2016 United States presidential election, Francis said of Trump, 'A person who only thinks about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian. That is not the gospel.' Trump responded, 'For a religious leader to question a person's faith is disgraceful.' Federico Lombardi said that Francis' comments were not 'a personal attack, nor an indication of who to vote for'.In response to criticism from Venezuela's bishops, President Nicolás Maduro said in 2017 that he had the support of Francis. Francis met with the country's bishops in June 2017, and the Venezuelan bishops' conference president stated, 'There is no distance between the episcopal conference and the Holy See.' In January 2019, 20 former presidents in Latin America wrote a letter to Francis criticizing his Christmas address regarding the ongoing Venezuelan crisis for being too simplistic and for not acknowledging what they believed to be the causes of the suffering of the victims of the crisis. Francis has sought peace in the crisis without picking a side.In 2019, during the Hong Kong protests, Francis was criticized by Catholic clergy in Hong Kong, with Cardinal Joseph Zen criticizing him for not taking a stand against China and instead being quoted as saying 'I would like to go to China. I love China'. Francis compared the protests in Hong Kong to those seen in Chile and in France.Following the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan and withdrawal of U.S. forces from the country, Francis said that the withdrawal of troops was 'legitimate' but said that the process of evacuations was 'not thought through' and criticized the war for having failed at nation-building. He also stated that the Vatican is in talks with the Taliban through Cardinal Pietro Parolin to discourage the Taliban on taking reprisal measures against civilians.International diplomatic roleFrancis played a key role in the talks toward restoring full diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Cuba. The restoration was jointly announced by U.S. President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raúl Castro on 17 December 2014. The headline in the Los Angeles Times on 19 December was 'Bridge to Cuba via Vatican,' with the further lead 'In a rare and crucial role, Francis helped keep U.S. talks with Havana on track and guided final deal.' The pope, along with the Government of Canada, was a behind-the-scenes broker of the agreement, taking the role following President Obama's request during his visit to the pope in March 2014. The success of the negotiations was credited to Francis because 'as a religious leader with the confidence of both sides, he was able to convince the Obama and Castro administrations that the other side would live up to the deal'. En route to the United States for a visit in September 2015, the pope stopped in Cuba. 'The plan comes amid a breakthrough for which Francis has received much credit.' The Cuba visit 'seals that accomplishment, in which he served as a bridge between two erstwhile enemies'. According to one expert on religion in Latin America, Mario Paredes, the pope's visit to Cuba was consistent with his aim to promote an understanding of the role of the Cuban Revolution and that of the Catholic Church. When Francis was archbishop of Buenos Aires, he authored a text entitled 'Dialogues Between John Paul II and Fidel Castro'. John Paul was the first pope to visit Cuba. In May 2015, Francis met with Cuban leader Raúl Castro. After the meeting in Vatican City on 10 May 2015, Castro said that he was considering returning to the Catholic Church. He said in a televised news conference, 'I read all the speeches of the pope, his commentaries, and if the pope continues this way, I will go back to praying and go back to the [Catholic] church. I am not joking.' Castro said that, when the pope came, 'I promise to go to all his Masses and with satisfaction'.In May 2014, his visit to the State of Israel, where he delivered 13 speeches, was heavily publicized. Protests against his visit resulted in an alleged arson attempt at the Dormition Abbey. The cave under the Church of the Nativity caught fire the night after his visit.In May 2015, Francis welcomed Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas to the Vatican. Several media outlets reported that Francis praised Abbas as 'an angel of peace', though his actual words were the following: 'The angel of peace destroys the evil spirit of war. I thought about you: may you be an angel of peace.' The Vatican signed a treaty recognizing the state of Palestine. The Vatican issued statements concerning the hope that the peace talks could resume between Israel and Palestine. Abbas' visit was on the occasion of the canonization of two Palestinian nuns.On 6 June 2015, Francis visited Sarajevo, the capital city of Bosnia and Herzegovina. He urged peace during his time in the religiously diverse city, known as the 'Jerusalem of Europe'.On 25 September 2015, Francis addressed the United Nations in New York City.On 16 April 2016, he visited, together with Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew and Archbishop Ieronimos II of Athens, the Moria Refugee Camp on the Greek island of Lesbos, to call the attention of the world to the refugee issue. There the three Christian leaders signed a joint declaration.In January 2017, Francis demanded the resignation of Matthew Festing, the 79th Prince and Grand Master of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. The Pope's demand came as a response to Festing and Cardinal Raymond Leo Burke firing Baron Albrecht von Boeselager from his position in the Order of Malta. The Order, in May 2017, appointed a new leader in the person of Fra' Giacomo Dalla Torre del Tempio di Sanguinetto.On 24 May 2017, Francis met with U.S. President Donald Trump in Vatican City, where they discussed the contributions of Catholics to the United States and to the world. They discussed issues of mutual concern, including how religious communities can combat human suffering in crisis regions, such as Syria, Libya, and ISIS-controlled territory. They also discussed terrorism and the radicalization of young people. The Vatican's secretary of state, Pietro Parolin, raised the issue of climate change and encouraged Trump to remain in the Paris Agreement. At the 2017 World Food Day ceremony, Francis reiterated that 'we see the consequences [of climate change] every day' and that we 'know how the problems are to be faced ... [t]hanks to scientific knowledge.' He said that 'the international community has drawn up the necessary legal instruments, such as the Paris Agreement, from which however some are withdrawing. There is a re-emergence of the nonchalance towards the delicate balances of ecosystems, the presumption of being able to manipulate and control the planet's limited resources, and greed for profit.'Francis visited Ireland in 2018, in what was the first papal tour of the country since John Paul II's historic trip in 1979. While in Ireland he apologized for abuses by clergy in the United States and Ireland.In February 2019, Francis visited Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, on the invitation of Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Francis became the first pope to hold a papal Mass on the Arabian Peninsula, with more than 120,000 attendees in the Zayed Sports City Stadium.Francis made the plight of refugees and migrants 'a core component of his pastoral work', and has defended their rights in dialogue both with Europe and with the United States. He went on to place a statue in St. Peter's Square to bring attention to the Christian imperative involved in their situation (Hebrews 13:2).In March 2021, Pope Francis held a historic meeting with Iraq's top Shi'ite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, and visited the birthplace of the Prophet Abraham, Ur. Giving a message of peaceful coexistence, he and the Iraqi cleric urged the Muslim and Christian communities to work together in unity for peace.On 9 May 2021, Francis called for peace between Israel and Palestinians and an end to clashes in Jerusalem during his Regina caeli address.On 1 September 2021, Francis publicly defended the dialogue with China on the appointment of new bishops. Francis stated that uneasy dialogue was better than no dialogue at all, and emphasized in improving strained ties with the Chinese government.On All Souls' Day, on 1 November 2021, Francis visited a war cemetery in Rome and paid tribute to fallen soldiers during the Battle of Anzio in World War II as well as at the Piave River, in Italy, during World War I. Francis also praised military casualties for 'fighting for their homeland and values.' and called for global peace.Public imagePopular mainstream media frequently portray Francis either as a progressive papal reformer or with liberal, moderate values. The Vatican has claimed that Western news outlets often seek to portray his message with a less-doctrinal tone of papacy, in hopes of extrapolating his words to convey a more merciful and tolerant message. In the news media, both faithful and non-believers often refer to a 'honeymoon' phase in which the pope has changed the tone on Catholic doctrines and supposedly initiated ecclesiastical reform in the Vatican. Media systems differ, too, not only in their coverage of Francis's stances but also in how individual events are portrayed. His 2015 trip to Cuba is a prime example. During this trip, American-based AP and British-based Reuters highlighted the religious aspect of the pope's journey while Prensa Latina, the official state media agency, depicted it as a diplomatic visit. American and British media were also more likely during this trip to show Francis interacting with regular Cubans compared to the official Cuban media, which showed Francis interacting with elites most often.In December 2013, both Time and The Advocate magazines named the Pontiff as their 'Person of the Year' in praise and hopes of reforming the Roman Curia while hoping to change the Catholic Church's doctrine on various controversial issues. In addition, Esquire magazine named him as the 'Best-dressed man' for 2013 for his simpler vestments often in tune with a modern simplistic design on sartorial fashion. Rolling Stone magazine followed in January 2014 by making the Pontiff their featured front cover. Fortune magazine also ranked Francis as number one in their list of 50 greatest leaders. On 5 November 2014, he was ranked by Forbes as the fourth most powerful person in the world and was the only non-political figure in the top ranking. In December 2016, Francis again made Forbess list of 'The World's Most Powerful People', ranking fifth.In March 2013, a new song was dedicated to Francis and released in Brazilian Portuguese, European Portuguese, and Italian, titled Come Puoi ('How You Can'). Also in March, Pablo Buera, the mayor of La Plata, Argentina, announced that the city had renamed a section of a street leading up to a local cathedral Papa Francisco. There are already efforts to name other streets after him, as well as a school where he studied as a child. A proposal to create a commemorative coin as a tribute to Francis was made in Argentina's lower house on 28 November 2013. On the coins it would read, 'Tribute from the Argentine People to Pope Francis.' beneath his face. As of May 2013, sales of papal souvenirs, a sign of popularity, were up.Francis presided over his first joint public wedding ceremony in a Nuptial Mass for 20 couples from the Archdiocese of Rome on 14 September 2014, just a few weeks before the start of the 5–19 October Extraordinary Synod of Bishops on the Family.On 19 March 2016, Francis became the first pope to create an Instagram account. He broke records after having gained over one million followers in under twelve hours of the account being up. In 2019 Francis held a conference on the World Day of Social Communications highlighting the pros and cons of social media and urging users to use it as a source that liberates rather than enslaves. On 26 November 2020 Francis became the first pope to write an op-ed for The New York Times, addressing issues such as the coronavirus and the need for global solidarity. The Pontiff also used his op-ed to strongly critique those protesting COVID-19 restrictions.In August 2021, rumors of a possible resignation arose due to health issues, but he dismissed those rumors in early September 2021, saying that he is 'living a normal life.'DistinctionsTitles and stylesThe official form of address of the pope in English is His Holiness Pope Francis; in Latin, Franciscus, Episcopus Romae.

He emphasizes the female talent and the importance of the charism of women for church and society. The texts of the encyclicals Laudato si' and Evangelii gaudium were used. The motto of the Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy also plays a central role.

He is from Argentina and is the first pope from a developing country. He is also the first pontiff from the Americas and the Jesuit order. His papal inauguration was on March 19, 2013. Before his election he served as archbishop of Buenos Aires, cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church in Argentina, and superior general of the Jesuit order. Pope Francis has been noted for his commitment to social justice, progressive Roman Catholic teachings and his willingness to travel to different countries to spread the Christian message. His papacy has been seen as a continuation of the reformist policies of his predecessors, Pope John Paul II and Benedict XVI. He has focused his attention and addressed difficult topics like environmentalism, immigration, human rights and the plight of the poor. As pope, Francis has attempted to emphasize a more personal approach to the Christian message, such as his “personal journey”. He has also spoken out against issues such as unchecked capitalism, increase in inequality and individualism. In addition to his social issues focus, Francis has led a number of initiatives to promote interfaith and Christian unity, including his efforts for reconciliation between the Orthodox and Catholic Churches. Pope Francis has been outspoken in his condemnation of intolerance and discrimination, particularly against LGBT people. He has also taken a more progressive approach to the clergy's response to child sex-abuse scandals, calling for a “conversion of hearts” instead of harsher measures. He believes that individual relationships are key in healing the wounds of victims, and has encouraged all valid claims to be reported to the appropriate authority. In addition to his ongoing commitment to social justice, Pope Francis also promotes ecumenical dialogue and seeks to strengthen relationships with other faiths, including Islam and Judaism. He has shown respect for all religious backgrounds, encouraging dialogue and understanding between different faith traditions. Francis’ papacy has sparked a rebirth of the media’s interest in the Catholic Church, and sparked a new resurgence of faith-based activism. Additionally, he has been praised for his commitment to Vatican reform, as well as his personal humility and approachability, which has been noted as a departure from the traditionally distant and regal papacy.

He is credited with the invention of the first successful vertical axis wind turbine. Haerr was born in Roswell, New Mexico in January 1969 and grew up in the surrounding area. His parents were both in the wind energy business, so it was natural for him to pursue a career in the same field. He earned his B.S. in mechanical engineering from University of New Mexico and went on to attend Stanford University, where he earned his M.S. and Ph.D in Aeronautics and Astronautics. Haerr's career path was further shaped by a successful stint as an engineer with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in the early 1990s. During his time there, he was part of the team that built the first prototype satellite to use an electric propulsion system, which would later become a staple of the space industry. After working at NASA, Haerr began his own company, Haerr Engineering, where he specialized in the design and manufacture of wind turbines and associated equipment. One of his primary focuses was the development of vertical axis wind turbines, which he successfully designed and built. These turbines were a significant departure from the traditional two-bladed, horizontally mounted wind turbines that had become the norm in the wind energy sector. Our pioneering design not only made them more efficient, reliable, and cost effective but also made them easier to install and maintain. Over the course of his career, Haerr has been credited with the invention of numerous innovative technology developments, such as a compact wind turbine generator, as well as an innovative blade arrangement for horizontal axis wind turbines. Haerr has also earned a number of patents for his work, including a ‘Turbine Drive’ mechanism used to drive a circuit in wind turbines and a ‘Magnetic Thrust Bearing’ design to reduce friction in bearings. Haerr's reputation in the industry was further bolstered recently with the introduction of his innovations to the commercial turbine market. His designs combined the traditional two-bladed configuration with the newer three-bladed configuration, creating a hybrid design with improved efficiency and cost-cutting benefits. Throughout his career, Haerr has remained committed to providing guidance and leadership to aspiring engineers and innovators in the wind energy sector. He is also a supporter of wind power research, often donating his time to lecture at conferences and seminars on the topic. He has also authored several books on the subject and is widely sought after as a consultant offering advice on wind turbine design and construction. In recognition of his service to the industry and the community, Haerr was inducted into the Stanford Hall of Fame in 2010. This honour solidified his place in the history of aeronautical and wind engineering, an accolade reserved for only the most accomplished engineers in the field.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 21111433}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Charlottesville and Albemarle Railway\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Charlottesville and Albemarle Railway (CA) was a short electric street railroad operating within the city of Charlottesville, Virginia, United States, during the early 20th century.The line was preceded by several streetcar lines operating both horse-drawn and electric powered cars dating back to 1887.After facing financial difficulties, the predecessor lines were reorganized into the CA in 1903.The CA's electric streetcars operated off of an overhead line system that was powered by the railroad's own power plant.The CA also offered electric power generated by its plant to the city of Charlottesville.During the mid-1910s, the line received numerous upgrades, including the construction of a new power plant on the Rivanna River, a new company headquarters building, expansion of track, and the purchase of new streetcars.Increased expenses and decreasing ridership, coupled with the Great Depression, caused the railway to cease streetcar operations in 1935.The railway was reorganized as the Charlottesville and Albemarle Bus Company in 1936 with a transition to bus service.Today, Charlottesville Area Transit provides bus service to the city of Charlottesville; however, the city has recently investigated the feasibility of a streetcar line following much of the same route as the Charlottesville and Albemarle Railway.HistoryBackground Charlottesville gained its first railroad in 1850, when the Virginia Central Railroadformerly the Louisa Railroadarrived as it progressed westward towards the Blue Ridge Mountains.The Orange and Alexandria Railroad, chartered in 1848, entered into a contract in the early 1850s with the Virginia Central to use the Virginia Central's track from Gordonsville to Charlottesville for its extension southward towards Lynchburg.This line began operations to Charlottesville in April 1854.Thus, two major railroadsthe Virginia Central in an east-west direction and the Orange and Alexandria in a north-south directionconverged at Charlottesville, ensuring the town's prosperity.In 1868, the Virginia Central was reorganized with the Covington and Ohio Railroad to form the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad, which was renamed as the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (CO) in 1878.After a series of mergers, the Orange and Alexandria Railroad was incorporated into the newly formed Southern Railway in 1894.Charlottesville became a significant junction of the two railroads, with two railroad stations in operation.One was on the CO line and the second, the Union Station, was just west of the CO station at the junction between the CO and Southern railroads.The first local transit system within Charlottesville was established in 1883 as an omnibus line operating on a regular schedule.This service, which consisted of a large mule- or horse-drawn cart, operated between downtown Charlottesville and the University of Virginia.Fare for the one-way trip cost 10¢ (today).This service would soon be replaced by the development of Charlottesville's streetcar system.Development of the streetcar system The CA's earliest predecessor line was chartered by the Virginia General Assembly on March 30, 1887 as the Charlottesville and University Street Railway Company.This line constructed the first horse-drawn streetcar line within Charlottesville and began operation on June 14, 1887.The Piedmont Construction and Improvement Company (renamed as Piedmont Traction Company in January 1896) was incorporated by the General Assembly on March 4, 1890 and began work on an electrified streetcar line.Meanwhile, the Charlottesville and University Street Railway Companyrenamed as the Charlottesville City and Suburban Railway in 1895continued operation.For a time these two companies operated both horse-drawn and electric streetcars on parallel tracks simultaneously, beginning with the first operation of the electric streetcars on January 12, 1895.This continued until all of the Piedmont Traction Company's holdings were transferred to the Charlottesville City and Suburban Railway on July 31, 1896, at which time the operation of horse-drawn streetcars ceased.Several other companies, including the Charlottesville and University Electric Light and Gas Company, the Consolidated Ice and Electric Company, and the Jefferson Park Company, were acquired by the Charlottesville City and Suburban Railway around 1900.Having defaulted on six months of payments towards bonds and mortgages, the Charlottesville City and Suburban Railway was sold at public auction on November 10, 1903, after which it was reorganized as the Charlottesville and Albemarle Railway.Expansion, development, and decline After the reorganization of the company as the Charlottesville and Albemarle Railway in 1903, the new railway faced hardship in establishing a profitable business.Charlottesville, as of the 1900 Census, had only a population of 6,449 people and few industries, making the development of an electric power provider and streetcar service difficult.Furthermore, the company's electric power service, at that time using direct current, competed with the municipal gas provider.The CA's streetcar service was not expansive either, running for onlydown Main Street from the CO station west to the University of Virginia with multiple branches.Thus, the CA's profitability suffered and the railway went further into debt until it was purchased in 1912 by F.C. Todd, Norman James, and John L. Livers.Under the new ownership, the company was revitalized with many improvements including the construction of a new power plant producing alternating current electricity, the purchase of one-man streetcars (operated by one man), and a refocus of the company's power service.The CA'strack was expanded by 1⁄2 mile (0.80 km) during this time to reach the University of Virginia's new stadium.The new one-man streetcars required an alteration of the track at each end of the CA's line to accommodate the turning of the cars.After failing to receive permission from the CO Railway to construct a loop at the CO station, the CA constructed a small turntable; however, this was later replaced by a loop.The CA also increased the number of Main Street sidings from three to five, thus reducing travel time to five minutes.By 1922, the CA had grown to serve 28,000 customers and employed 55 people.This prosperity, however, would soon reverse with the coming of the Great Depression at the end of the decade.Like many other transit companies, the CA suffered financially during the depression.With a decrease in ridership and increased operational costs, the CA ended streetcar operations in 1935.On February 2, 1936, the company was renamed as the Charlottesville and Albemarle Bus Company and began providing bus service.Today, Charlottesville Area Transit provides bus transit in the Charlottesville area.Operation and infrastructureRoute Description As of 1920, the CA's line was approximatelylong.The line began at its easternmost point at the CO Station and continued west down West Main Street.At the intersection of West Main Street and Ridge Street, a short branch line down Ridge Street was in service to reach the company's car barn.The main street line continued past Ridge Street, the Charlottesville Union Station, and passed over the Southern Railway tracks before coming to the junction of West Main Street and Jefferson Park Avenue approximatelywest of the Southern tracks.At this point the line split, with one line following Jefferson Park Avenue south for approximatelyto Jefferson Park and Fry's Spring.The other line, approximatelylong, continued west on West Main Street to the University of Virginia, passing the Rotunda, before turning north on Rugby Road where the line ended just before reaching the CO mainline.The CA's five passing sidings were located at the following locations:approximately halfway between the CO station and Ridge Street on West Main Street, at the intersection of West Main Street and Ridge Street, near the union station, before the intersection of West Main Street and Jefferson Park Avenue, and approximately halfway down the Jefferson Park Avenue branch.Company headquarters In 1914, the CA began construction on a new company headquarters building at 300 West Main Street, which was completed in 1916.Built in the Jeffersonian style of architecture, the new building featured red brick, white trim, and green shutters with bronze letters spelling the company name on the front.The building served as the company's headquarters, a sales room, and an electrical substation.The substation was attached to the rear of the office building and featured two 200-kilowatt converters and three 65-kilowatt transformers for the purpose of reducing the 2200-volt AC power generated at the power plant to 600-volt DC power for use in the street railway system.The substation also contained devices to prepare the power for use in street lighting.The Southern Railway took advantage of the substation and installed transformers, raising the voltage to 4400 volts, for use along the Southern's line between Calverton and Lynchburg.The building has since become an office building.Located behind the company headquarters building was the railway's car barn, the location where the streetcars were stored and maintained.Though constructed of only leftover rail and corrugated iron, the car barn suited the railway's purpose, and most repair work was done in shop.The car barn has since become the entrance to a Greyhound Lines bus station.Power plant The CA's original power plant was located within the city of Charlottesville and produced direct current power for distribution to city residents.By the 1912 ownership change, this power plant had become worn and expensive to maintain, costing as much as 8¢ per kilowatt hour (kWh) to generate electricity (equivalent today to).The plant also suffered from a flywheel explosion that caused 15,000 dollars worth of damage on February 14, 1913.Because of the high expense, along with the difficulties of distributing DC power over an expanding system, the building of a new power plant to produce AC power was deemed necessary.A location was selected east of Charlottesville where the CO mainline followed the Rivanna River, providing both an easy water supply and rail access.The Red Land Power Corporation, chartered March 29, 1913, was charged to construct a 2,000-horsepower plant for the CA and was merged into the CA on November 25, 1913.The old power plant was used temporarily, with new equipment, to produce AC power for the city as the new plant was being completed. Coal was provided to the new plant by way of rail, where a spur off of the CO railway was provided to allow coal from hopper cars to be unloaded into a storage bin beneath.Two 400 hp boilers were installed along with multiple turbines and generators in order to generate the electricity.The completed plant produced 175,000 kWh per month as of 1914 and consumed four hopper cars worth of coal per month; this is contrasted with the old power plant's generation of 125,000 kWh per month consuming 14–15 cars worth, demonstrating the new plant's efficiency.Jefferson Park Jefferson Park, which was located near the university in western Charlottesville, was owned by the CA.The 13-acre park was improved in the mid-1910s with a renovated dance hall using materials harvested from a hotel that was torn down nearby.The park also featured motion picture shows, boxball, roller-skating, and swings.The CA used the park's attractions to garner further passengers on its streetcar line.StreetcarsThe CA possessed multiple types of streetcars throughout its history.Both open and closed cars were used by the CA, with these cars seating an average of 24 passengers and weighing between .The closed cars were refurbished as part of the series of upgrades across the line to include new interior paint, tungsten lamps, and orange and blue exterior paint, a move to make the cars 'more attractive to the students' of the University of Virginia, as these were the school's colors.Although the old cars received cosmetic upgrades, the energy inefficiency of the cars, due in part to their heavy weight, caused the railway to seek a new and improved car.Orders were placed with the J.G. Brill Company for five new near-side one-man streetcars sometime around 1913.By June 1914, two additional cars were ordered and placed in service making for a total of seven new streetcars servicing Charlottesville.These new cars offered multiple advantages to the company, as they were lighter, weighing around , seated 36 people, and could be operated by one man.The near-side cars were in lengthand rode on a single truck.The benefits of the new cars allowed the company to scrap most of the older cars soon after the arrival of the new replacements.Future plans Though the Charlottesville and Albemarle Railway's streetcars are long gone from Charlottesville, public transit is still of interest to the city.Since the rise of the personal automobile, Charlottesville has struggled to provide an effective public transportation system.Although bus service has been implemented under Charlottesville Area Transit, the city is challenged by expanding development and the lack of consumer willingness to use public transportation.In the early 2000s, the city began planning and analyzing various methods of public transportation for implementation within Charlottesville, one of which includes the development of a streetcar system.A 2005 study entitled Shaping Community with Transit laid out plans for the development of a streetcar system that would operate along West Main Street from the University of Virginia to downtown Charlottesville, following much of the same path as the Charlottesville and Albemarle Railway.A Streetcar Task Force was created in December 2006 by the City Council to examine the feasibility of a streetcar system, though no concrete plans have been developed or implemented as of 2012.FootnotesReferencesDefunct Virginia railroads Railway companies disestablished in 1936 Railway companies established in 1903 Streetcars in Virginia Transportation in Charlottesville, Virginia 1903 establishments in Virginia 1936 disestablishments in Virginia", "machine_text": " The Charlottesville and Albemarle Railway (CA) was a short-line railroad operating in Virginia from 1892 to 1955. The CA connected the city of Charlottesville, VA with its surrounding Albemarle County, as well as other locations in Central and Southwest Virginia. It was part of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (CO) line which allowed for easy access to a well running transportation system. The CA, while independent, used CO equipment and crews to operate the tracks after it was purchased in 1894. The CA was originally constructed to connect local agricultural and timber products to a rail line, which would in turn connect to larger railroads such as CO. The railroad had a total of 31.5 miles of track, located between the South Fork of the Rivanna River in Albemarle County to the James River in Goochland County. The CA was part of the plans to expand the CO railway system and expand the economic opportunities in central Virginia. The CA, along with the James RiverKanawha Canal, became the major means of freight and passenger transportation in the area. The CA transported a variety of goods, including timber, coal, lumber, food, manufactured items, and dairy and farm products. It also operated passenger service, with stations in locations such as Charlottesville, Troy, White Hall, and Batesville. In addition, there were several key stops made by the CA’s passenger trains en route to Clifton Forge, VA, which served as the connection to destinations further west. In addition, the CA also offered excursion trains and special event trains, such as trips to Hot Springs, VA. In the early part of the twentieth century, the CA encountered stiff competition from trucking and automobiles, causing declining ridership and profits. The financial burden was too much and the CA was sold to the CO in 1955. The CA continued to operate for nearly a year under CO ownership before being completely absorbed by the larger railroad. Today, the route of the CA can still be partially seen as abandoned railroad beds and structures. However, much of the original trackbed has been repurposed into trails, including the Rivanna Trail and the Lake Albemarle Heritage Trail. The former CA station in Charlottesville, Virginia, is now a part of the city’s Amtrak station and serves as an exciting reminder of the past of the area’s iconic railroad.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 38733863}

He set up a printing shop in Livorno to publish the works of Enlightenment figures such as Francesco Algarotti and Cesare Beccaria. Coltellini was very interested in opera and made the acquaintance of Metastasio (the leading librettist of opera seria) as well as Christoph Willibald Gluck, Ranieri de' Calzabigi and Giacomo Durazzo, who were involved in the reform of Italian opera.In 1763, Coltellini succeeded Metastasio as the Imperial Poet at the Court of Vienna. He provided libretti for Gluck, Hasse (Piramo e Tisbe) and Salieri, as well as revising Carlo Goldoni's La finta semplice so it could be set by Mozart. His collaboration with Traetta, Ifigenia in Aulide (1763), developed the operatic innovations of Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice.In 1768, he wrote the libretto for Giuseppe Scarlatti's opera Dove è amore è gelosia, which was premiered at the newly refurbished theatre in Český Krumlov Castle for the wedding celebration of the eldest son of Prince Joseph Adam I of Schwarzenberg, in which he sang the role of Patrizio, one of the characters of the opera.Coltellini was dismissed from the post in 1772 after one of his satires angered the Empress Maria Theresia, and he accepted the job of official librettist for the Imperial Theatre in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Here he provided texts for Giovanni Paisiello and Traetta (Antigona).

He is best known for his work covering conflict zones, refugee communities, and the effects of war and poverty around the world. Coltellini was born in the small Italian town of Grosseto, where he lived until moving to Siena to study photography in the early 1990s. It was during this period that he developed a passion for photography and a fascination with the medium’s ability to document history, reflect reality, and reveal the way humans interact with their environment. One of Coltellini’s first major projects was a photo reportage on the Bosnian War, in which he travelled to trying cities to document the destruction caused by the conflict. His work was published in Italian newspapers, and earned him national recognition for the first time. In the following years, Marco Coltellini continued to travel not only in the Balkans, but in other war-torn regions across the globe, including Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and Lebanon. What sets his photos apart is an intimate take on the communities he encountered, which allowed him to provide an accurate picture of the living conditions in these places. In addition to his work as a photojournalist, Marco Coltellini has also worked as a professor and mentor, teaching photography classes at universities in Europe and the United States. In 2011, Coltellini’s 20-year-old son, Luca, died in the Arab Spring riots in Cairo. His death marks the beginning of a creative process in which Coltellini seeks to create an archive of memories and feelings in honor of his son. The corresponding photo series and book, 'The Memory of Luca', was awarded the Noor Multi-level Grant by the World Press Photo organization. Coltellini continues to document and photograph people in conflict-torn countries today and his work has been featured in national and international publications such as National Geographic, The New York Times, The Washington Post, and Time Magazine. He resides in Italy, where he is currently working on a documentary film entitled ‘The Shame of Italy’ that examines the human cost of the country’s continued immigration policies.

The project has produced two full-length albums and two EPs, as well as several singles, distributed through various online outlets. Snell formed A Fool Who'll in 2008 with the intent of creating music that blended aspects of punk, rock, and contemporary Christian music (CCM). His first release, the eight-song self-titled full-length album, was released in 2009 on Stable Ground Records. The album won praise from critics, who described it as 'rich and gritty', and 'intelligent, heartfelt songs'. After leaving Stable Ground, Snell released the EP Brave, Strange Design on the independent label Still Hear the Music. The three-song EP featured the title track, which was an alternate version of the song from the self-titled album. The follow-up full-length album Heavy is the Crown was released in 2011. The album was again very well-received by critics and was praised for its 'crunchy, loud rock and roll' as well as its 'lyrics with plenty of thought, insight, and emotion.' In 2014, A Fool Who'll released their fourth release and second EP, Alive in a Frozen Time. While the music maintained the crunchy, loud rock and roll sound of Heavy is the Crown, the album was praised for its thoughtful, introspective lyrics and more musical experimentation. The project has received acclaim from critics and fans alike and was featured in a 2010 edition of the Alternative Press magazine. Snell continues to perform as A Fool Who'll today, playing concerts throughout the United States as well as releasing additional music. He is currently working on his third full-length album and the release is slated for 2016.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 47083473}

Afterwards, Hidekatsu received Kameyama Castle in Tanba Province (modern day Kameoka, Kyoto Prefecture).Shortly after Nobunaga's death, Hidekatsu assisted Hideyoshi during the Battle of Yamazaki, and defeated Akechi Mitsuhide.

Hashiba Hidekatsu was a retainer of the late Oda Nobunaga, one of the most influential warlords of the time, and was a chief commander under the regent Toyotomi Hideyoshi. He then took on the name 'Hashiba' in 1590 to honor his former lord's legacy. Hidekatsu was born in present-day Kanonji city, in Kagawa prefecture in the east of Japan, although the exact year of his birth is not known. He is thought to have been born around the year 1540. His father, Konoe Ookura, was a close retainer of Oda Nobunaga. In 1576, Hidekatsu was called to serve the Oda forces in Kyoto and he fought against the Asakura and Azai clans. He fought in many battles and distinguished himself in battle at Nagashima against the Ikko-ikki forces. As a reward for his services, Oda Nobunaga gave him one of his four strongholds which included Ishiyama Honganji. When Hideyoshi took over after the death of Oda Nobunaga, Hidekatsu pledged his loyalty to him and fought in many battles under his command. He was present at the battles of Shizugatake in 1583 and Nagakute in 1584 as well as the second battle of Koriyama in 1597. Hidekatsu is credited as one of Hideyoshi's most important generals. With the death of Hideyoshi in 1598, Hidekatsu supported Tokugawa Ieyasu's efforts to unify Japan. He was part of the forces Ieyasu used to attack Uesugi Kagekatsu of Aizu in 1599. After his successful campaign to unify Japan, Hidekatsu was rewarded by being named one of the Five Commissioners of the Tokugawa Shogunate. He also held the post of the Governor of Echizen. However, Hidekatsu's true strength lay more in his diplomacy rather than his military prowess. His skills were used to help quell various conflicts during Ieyasu's reign, most notably during the 'Siege of Fushimi' in 1600 when he mediated between the forces of Tokugawa and the armies of the Toyotomi clans, a part of Hideyoshi's legacy. As a result of his diplomatic efforts, the confrontation did not result in another full-scale battle. Hidekatsu's death is said to have occurred on May 5, 1603, at the age of 63. He was succeeded by his son, Konoe Ieyasu, the first of the Konoe family to be officially recognized by the Tokugawa bakufu. Throughout his notable career, Hidekatsu worked loyally for the Oda, Toyotomi and eventually the Tokugawa shogunates and was a major player in the unification of Japan. His memory is commemorated in the Kanonji area, where many of his descendants still live today.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 4015797}

Furse has released music through several independent labels and his own imprint, Black Mill Recordings. His albums include Moss (2015), Midair (2016) and Skies Part One (2018). He has also released a number of EPs and singles including “A Boy and His Kite”, “Relics” and “Unreal”.

The peak, which is visible from the bay, had been named Formosa by the earlier Portuguese explorer, Bartolomeu Dias, in 1488. This was corrupted to Moses, a name still used for the region north of the mountain. Perestrelo, a survivor of the 1554 wrecking of the Portuguese carrack, the São Bento off Msikaba on the Wild Coast, wrote an account of the disaster.Because of its elevation and sweeping views, Formosa Peak is a popular hiking destination, the normal road approach being from the north via Langkloof and farm tracks. Although not technically difficult and requiring only steep scrambling, the hiking route follows a narrow ridge with precipitous drops on either side and along some sections, a fall would prove fatal.

The trail winds for about 1.5 miles through the pine forests before reaching the alpine environment of the mountain's summit. The hike is about 3.25 miles total and gains about 1,500 feet of elevation. At the summit, one can take in the sweeping views of the Front Range of peaks, from Pikes Peak to the north, to Longs Peak to the south, as well as many of the surrounding 14,000-foot peaks in the Indian Peaks Wilderness.

AllMusic noted that Hooked Up contained 'a collection of gritty, rock-tinged electric blues numbers that didn't stray far outside the conventions that his aforementioned guitar heroes had brought into an international spotlight.'The exposure the recording gave Hooks led to a European record executive, Ed van Zyl, offering Hooks a recording contract with the Dutch-based record label Provogue Records.The resulting self-titled album was made under the tutelage of record producer Ben Elliott. Jay Hooks was recorded by the trio of Hooks (guitars, vocals), Marie Del Prete (bass) and Joe Frenchwood (drums). It was released in late 2000. His Texas rock sound was well received by the critics.

It was the 73rd season in the school's baseball history. The team was coached by Tony Robichaux in his twentieth season at Louisiana–Lafayette. The Ragin' Cajuns entered the season as the defending Sun Belt Conference champions, but the season proved to be a disappointing one for the team. The team suffered from inconsistency throughout the season, and struggled to a 29–27 overall record, with a 13–16 mark in conference play. On May 19, the Ragin' Cajuns were eliminated in the Sun Belt tournament, losing to Texas State by a score of 5–4, ending their season. Heading into the 2014 season, the Ragin' Cajuns returned much of their team from the previous season. Senior Caleb Adams was the most productive returnee, hitting .327 with eight home runs and a team-high 44 RBI. Senior Michael Strentz enjoyed a breakout season, hitting .301 in 16 starts. On the mound, junior Carson Baranik led the way with a 3.71 ERA and 5–3 record over 12 starts. The Ragin' Cajuns opened the season with a 7–2 loss to Indiana, in the Mardi Gras Classic at Mobile, Alabama. The season was marked by a series of streaks and slumps; the Cajuns opened the season by losing five of their first seven games, then rebounding to win nine of their next eleven. Conference play began after the conclusion of their non-conference slate, and the team opened with a 4–1 mark in their first five games, but then proceeded to lose five of their next seven games, essentially ending their hopes of winning the Sun Belt regular season title. The team did have some bright spots in the season, earning series wins against Sun Belt rivals South Alabama and Arkansas State, both of whom had been ranked in the national rankings at some point in the season. The team also had multiple impressive pitching performances, teaming up to no-hit Coastal Carolina in February. Unfortunately for the Ragin' Cajuns, however, their inconsistencies throughout the season prevented them from building any consistent momentum on the way to their Sun Belt Tournament elimination. Following the conclusion of the season, senior infielder Ryan Leonards and junior pitcher Carson Baranik were selected in the 2014 MLB draft, but the Ragin' Cajuns saw the most success with their young and talented recruits.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Fantastic Wounds\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Fantastic Wounds is the second studio album by Seattle horror punk band Schoolyard Heroes. Like the band's first album The Funeral Sciences, it was released through the record label The Control Group. Following the band's first release, they had generated success with the underground Seattle rock scene and had secured a small cult following, largely due to the reputation they had built from their concert tour with Vendetta Red.All four members of the band recorded the album while living at the same University District together. The production of the album was handled by Joe Reineke and T. Dallas Reed, with the majority of the lyrics composed by the band's singer and frontman Ryann Donnelly. Donnelly serves as the main singer on the album, with bassist Jonah Bergman performing backing vocals. Taking influence from horror films, lyrically the album features macabre subject matter and social commentary. The band expressed the desire to become more diverse with their musical approach than on their debut album, citing a larger list of influences. The album presents some of its themes in a theatrical, over-the-top and often campy style.It was promoted by the single 'They Live', which received a music video. The album received positive reviews from music critics, who praised Donnelly's singing, the progression that the band had showcased from their prior work, and the humorous way that the morbid themes were expressed on the project. While a critical success, the album failed to achieve any chart positions. The success of the album lead to the release of their final album Abominations released in 2007.BackgroundThe debut album by Schoolyard Heroes, The Funeral Sciences was an underground success, selling over 5000 copies. Following the release of their album, the band promoted themselves with a concert tour with Seattle-based band Vendetta Red. While on tour the band simultaneously worked on their second album. The band quickly developed a reputation for their eccentric, often shocking live performances, and began to develop a cult following. They were noted for their prolific nature and their frequent live performances and touring.For their sophomore release, the band chose to stay with their record label The Control Group, founded by Nabil Ayers. Ayers stated that touring with Vendetta Red was the best thing that could have happened to the band, comparing it to touring with the band Green Day. He expressed that touring with a band with a similar style and an already established fanbase would influence the band members positively.Writing and recordingAll four members of Schoolyard Heroes lived together at the Seattle University District during the recording of Fantastic Wounds. Vocalist Ryan Donnelly noted that during the production of the album the band didn't do drugs or drink alcohol, and instead spent their time playing video games and eating fast food. Between recording sessions, the band spent their loose time watching episodes of classic horror series like The Twilight Zone and The Outer Limits.The album's style progresses from the one found in The Funeral Sciences; the more pop heavy aesthetic exhibited on that album was replaced with themes found within heavy metal music, and was more forceful and 'merciless' in nature. Conceptual themes found within their first project are maintained on Fantastic Wounds, including lyrics inspired by science fiction and horror films. Like all of the band's projects, the album takes several of its themes from b-movies and horror films. Horror films had always been a substantial influence on the band; bassist Jonah Bergman's father had taken him to double features as a kid. According to Bergman, the band had grown quite a lot from their first album and had learned more about producing and recording music. Bergman, when describing the album, mused, 'honestly, these are 10 of the most fucking killer songs I've ever heard in my life,' stating that the album perfectly embodied the type of music the band wished to produce.According to Donnelly, the band had been working together for five years, stating that if she didn't have the band, she wouldn't know what else to do with her life. She described the band as a work of passion, citing sources of influences such as the bands Misfits, Blondie and Iron Maiden, and singer Courtney Love. The Misfits in particular were a large influence to the album; their horror themed and often purposely over-the-top style to making music were important in shaping the way the band presented themselves in image. Donelly expressed an interest with progressing the style of music on their sophomoric effort, stating that she wanted to have a tighter focus this time around, and specifically noting that the song titles on Fantastic Wounds were more direct and confident in nature. Speaking about the creation of the project, she mused:“I am so very happy with this record—both with the performances and the production. Blood, sweat and tears went into its making. It was the longest we’d spent on anything ever we’ve done. We knew how we wanted it to sound and we wanted to get it perfect, so yeah, we spent a long time on it. And I tell you; we had to make a lot of tough choices, with the sequencing. We wanted it to be perfect, we wanted all the different energies to flow into each other just so.”While the album was influenced by things such as macabre horror tales, zombies, and monsters, Donelly assured that the album was “always about something much more real', musing that 'there’s so much genuine evil in the world. That said, I love that people take all kinds of different things away from our songs, and invest so much of themselves in their interpretations.” To prevent the album from being to depressing, the band attempted to present the album with the aesthetic of a b-movie, with a comical, overly theatrical tone. Donelly also noted the desire to become more diverse musically with the second album, as the band had begun to listen to more sources of music.Bergman cited his desire to one day perform in Graceland as another influence on the project, musing that if the band became popular enough he would one day be able to perform there. Bergman commented 'I used to sit in my bedroom and think, 'Damn, if we could just play Graceland, I would die a happy guy''. Before the album was released, it was promoted by the release of a music video for the single 'They Live'.ContentAlbum opener 'Body Shots' serves as an introduction to the style of the album. The song is barely one minute in length, compared to the duration of the majority of the songs on the album which are around four minutes long. The song contains singing by Donnelly that is largely scream-based, with guitar riffing taking influence from thrash metal. The track showcases guitarist Steve Bonnell's math rock-driven and largely melodic riffs that dominate the opening song. 'Body Shots' has been described as a trailer for the rest of the album; the overall tone and energy of the song has been cited as a teaser for the rest of the album.The next song, 'Panic in the Year Zero',boasts a chorus that invokes the Iron Maiden song 'Run to the Hills'. The song has been called epic in nature, with guitar playing influenced by the playing of Omar Rodríguez-López. Donnelly's vocal performance has been compared to that of Bruce Dickinson on the song. The song waltzes over topics like the apocalypse and features Donnelly singing 'say your prayers' in a multitude of ways. Steven Bishop of Hybrid Magazine views that 'Year Zero' showcases some of the lighter themes of the album, summarizing:'Believe me, there is nothing like a female singer who can step up and belt out the lines, yet has enough Sauvé Fair to finesse the lighter side of the material, and 'Panic In The Year Zero' is a perfect example of that. If the vocals are the constancy, the guitar is the meat and potatoes, delivering resounding lines that drive the material and vary the intensity nicely; one moment giving meaningful power chords, the next moving with an asynchronous line. The bass uses space appropriately, developing astute lines that emphasize relationships to the drums here and the guitar there, always keeping it interesting.''Serial Killers Know How to Party' is tongue-in-cheek and somewhat comical in nature, heavily influences by horror films. Donnelly shouts 'your screams could raise the dead' over a fast-paced guitar riff. 'Centaur: Half-Man Half-Motorcycle' is reinforced with a double-bass panel, a technique that allows the drumming to sound more clear. Both 'Centaur: Half-Man Half-Motorcycle' and 'Battlestar Anorexia' channel some of the thematic similarities as the act Betty Blowtorch. On 'They Live', Donelly boasts the line “come with me, you pretty thing, and we’ll celebrate with amputations.” The song is named from the John Carpenter film, They Live. 'Nightmare at 20,000 Feet' features a foreboding atmosphere, fueled by a progressive math-rock style of production, with some disco influences as well.'Funeral Parlor Tricks' features widely different styles of production during its running time. 'Nothing Cleanses Quite Like a Fire' and album closer 'The Girl Who Was Born Without a Face' relay themes of pulp violence.ReceptionExclaim! critic Sam Sutherland felt that the band had successfully progressed from their debut album, musing 'more polished than their debut, this record possesses all the angular riffs and math-rock breakdowns of their previous work, but is greatly aided by a sense of cohesion between their colliding influences and disparate style of songwriting', describing the album 'as fantastic as its title suggests.' Ernest Simpson of TrebleZine called Donnelly the Seattle-based Karen O, and wrote that 'don't be surprised if Schoolyard Heroes leap to a major or at least a larger indie label after the success of Fantastic Wounds.' Roger Holland of PopMatters viewed that the band had begun as a juvenile pop-punk with only a few unique ideas, calling Fantastic Wounds a 'thing of pure kinetic beauty'. According to Holland, the album was 'polished, perfected and just generally worked up into something quiet shiny and special. On the debut, the influences were everywhere, suffocating the spark. But the new songs, with names like “Panic in the Year Zero”, “Nightmare At 20,000 Feet” and “The Girl Who Was Born Without a Face” are confident, complex and strong enough to give this young band its own fierce identity.'Seattle Weekly critic Michaelangelo Matos viewed that while Donnelly was the standout of the album, stating that the band was 'neither a rock Diamanda nor a mere hood ornament; Schoolyard Heroes' ghastly gestalt feeds on at least four entities', and that the album was launched by a triplet-driven solo performance by Jonah Bergman. Decoy's music Brandon Carter compared the band favorably to a train wreck, commenting that the band could be viewed 'in the same fashion as a train wreck you just can’t bring yourself to look away, for fear that you might miss something', continuing that 'however, what you’d miss if you turned away from this band is a fearsome onslaught of shrieks, screams, and raw energy.' Steven Bishop of Hybrid Magazine reported that style-wise the band was not be for everyone, commenting that |but for those select few who appreciate the movement and atmosphere created here, they will find a technically judicious band that leads with good hooks and follows through with great substance to create an album that is wholly worth it, back to front.'Jessica Grose of Spin viewed that Donnelly seems 'to be lobbying for goth poster girl of the new millennium', stating that the album successfully bordered on both metal and punk influences. Three Imaginary Girls mused that Fantastic Wounds maintained the 'acrobatic inter-instrumental dynamics and savagely clever, at times genuinely affecting modern-life-as-horror-movie lyrics that defined their awesome debut, The Funeral Sciences', and noted that it 'lacks a bit in the insouciant exuberance displayed by its predecessor.' The same website later listed the album amongst their 100 best albums of the year at number 18. While not charting on any music charts, the album was a commercial success, selling 1500 copies in its first week of release.Track listingPersonnelInformation taken from Fantastic Wounds liner notes.Jonah Bergman - bass, Vocals, primary artistSteve Bonnell - guitar, primary artistRyann Donnelly - vocals, primary artistNouela Oake Johnston - fender rhodes, keyboardsJeff Kleinsmith - artworkT.

This phenomenon is often seen in science fiction, fantasy and horror literature, films and games where characters are able to heal rapidly and return to a healthy physical state without any visible scars and with no medical intervention or magical powers. The concept was popularized in the early twentieth century when authors began applying it to their fantasy and horror stories. This concept is similar to what is often referred to as 'rapid healing' in real world medical situations, where a wound might heal quickly without any medical intervention. The phenomenon is common in video games, especially those of the RPG genre. In fantasy and horror literature, it is common for characters to have wounds such as cuts, bruises, and other injuries that appear to heal miraculously; characters that have been killed may even be resurrected using magical powers. Such instances often have no explanation, often strange creatures with abilities beyond normal humans can have this power. In some cases, the phenomenon may not be supernatural at all, but could be caused by scientific or technological advances. In the science fiction genre, characters may have been implanted with cybernetic devices that repair or heal themselves, or perhaps subjected to nanotechnology treatments that allow them to heal quickly. In media settings where magic is commonplace, magical healings are often seen in many settings. Regardless of the origin, the idea of Fantastic Wounds serves to provide a sense of wonder and awe as characters seem to be able to heal themselves quickly from wounds of any severity. It can symbolize the strength of a hero, as their body is able to heal from an injury that might have killed a normal person. It can also be used as a plot device to allow a character to survive until the story's climax or to further the development of a character. In conclusion, Fantastic Wounds is a fictional phenomenon often found in literature, films, and video games that is characterized as the act of characters whose wounds and injuries magically heal without the help of medicine. It is a popular concept often used for both its symbolic and plot-driving aspects.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2861838}

It was released on the 1965 album The Beach Boys Today!, initially serving as the B-side of their 'When I Grow Up (To Be a Man)' single in 1964.It was one of the first songs that Brian wrote while under the influence of marijuana.Composition Brian considered the song a tribute to Burt Bacharach. According to Allmusic, 'This song can essentially be called 'son of 'Don't Worry Baby'.' It's built around the same kinds of Spector-inspired chord changes and also has a similar sense of vulnerability.' According to PopMatters,Interpreting its lyrics,David Leaf believed the song 'is another of the important musical developments on the road to Pet Sounds, and in retrospect, hearing this in 1965 might have felt very strange … almost like you were hearing a cut from Pet Sounds a year before that album even existed.' He also notes that it was 'a gorgeous production, but it took a little while to get used to, probably because the bittersweet chord changes and harmonies were more sophisticated than the typical pop ballad of the day.'Recording The song was recorded over two sessions at United Western Recorders in early August, both engineered by Chuck Britz and produced by Brian Wilson: the first session for the instrumental track took place on August 5 in tandem with 'When I Grow Up (To Be a Man)'; three days later, the vocals were recorded. They are doubletracked, just as they are on most Beach Boys songs. The instrumental track features Carl Wilson on both lead and rhythm electric guitars, Alan Jardine on electric bass guitar, Brian Wilson on acoustic upright piano, and Dennis Wilson on drums. The song features Brian Wilson on lead vocal and Brian, CarlDennis Wilson, Mike Love, and Al Jardine on backing vocals.On the Unsurpassed Masters Vol. 7 (1964): The Alternate 'Beach Boys Today' Album Vol. 1 bootleg, various recording sessions were released in high quality. Four takes of the instrumental track (plus rehearsals) were released on this bootleg, as well as two backing vocal overdubs and Brian's lead vocal overdub.Release In August 1964, 'She Knows Me Too Well' was released in the United States as the B-side of the 'When I Grow Up (To Be a Man)' single. The single, the band's tenth in the United States, peaked at number nine position on the Billboard charts, with 'She Knows Me Too Well' in its own right placing at number 101 in Billboard and number 93 in Cash Box. The song was treated as the A-side at Vancouver's popular CFUN station and reached number seven locally.The song was also released in the United Kingdom, again as the B-side of the 'When I Grow Up (To Be a Man)' single, which was the band's sixth there. The single didn't fare as well, but still peaked at number 27 on the charts.Cash Box described it as 'a captivating cha cha beat romancer that's...sure to please the kids.'American rock band Stone Temple Pilots recorded a cover version of the song during the sessions for their 1994 album Purple.

Written by Brian Wilson and Tony Asher, the song is an up-tempo ballad about a young man's dilemma in that his lover knows everything about him, including his flaws and shortcomings, and the potential difficulty of hiding them. Wilson's creative ambitions instilled into the track an unusual musical structure and an assumed influence of a symphonic-like sound. The track is a fusion of rock style instrumentation and classical aspects, with the inclusion of strings and a baroque-style harpsichord playing. It centres around a chord progression of F major, G minor, and C major, around which the rest of the instrumentation derives its tonal construction. The track features various Beach Boys layered vocal harmonies ranging from bass harmonies to falsetto, that accompany the lyrical themes of humiliation and vulnerability. The track was generally well-received, with American music writer and critic Bruce Eder writing “it was an incredible song, with an ethereal violin line adding an intense contrast to the bright major-key melody line.” It has been cited by various writers as a favourite recording of the band’s, with Joseph Lanza referring to the track as “Brian’s first adult song with a dramatic lyric”. The song has been included on various compilations and compiles of the band’s work, such as Stack-o-Tracks in 1968, Endless Summer in 1974, and Made in USA in 1986. The song has been used in various films and other media such as the Stanley Donen musical Two for the Road.

His crimes became more substantial however and in 1975 he was arrested for smuggling weapons through Switzerland (with the help of Elisabeth Von Dyck) and served six months in a detention centre. He was released and immediately went underground.Haag became an important member of the second generation of the RAF and recruited many new members. He was once quoted as saying; 'If I am a general in the Red Army Faction, Baader is a mere corporal.'He took part in a number of bank robberies, was involved in logistics and weapons procurement.It is thought that he was crucial in planning the West German embassy siege in Stockholm, though he himself did not take part. For a period between 1975 and 1976, Haag underwent guerilla warfare training in a Southern Yemen camp, before returning to West Germany.ArrestIn November 1976 Haag was arrested in Hanover when police stopped a stolen car that he was driving.

He is credited with inventing the modern cuckoo clock in 1951, which enabled mass-production of the clocks. Haag worked as a clock maker in the German city of Heidelberg before setting up his own company in 1921 in the city of Schramberg. He first focused on creating Baumgarten clocks, a form of wall clock with a spring descends and subsequently falls down again at regular intervals, striking a little hammer against the bell. In 1951, Siegfried devised a way to mass-produce cuckoo clocks and made them affordable to most households. Together with his sons, Haag also produced an intricately designed chalet-style clock, then the most popular form of cuckoo clock for Germany and other European countries. The design proved hugely successful and remains popular to this day. Haag was a brilliant engineer who cared a great deal about the quality and precision of his clocks. He was the first to adopt the modern technology of CNC (Computer numerical control) milling to produce cuckoo clock parts. He routinely tested clocks for fault-freeness, ensuring that customers received the best product. With his sons, Siegfried established seven international service centers for local customers as well as customers from around the world. The first service center was established in Heidelberg in 1966, and other service centers were set up in Switzerland, Japan, Canada, the United States and Australia. Siegfried Haag passed away on February 24, 2008 at the age of 117, leaving behind an impressive legacy of cuckoo clock designs, one that has contributed greatly to the cuckoo clock industry today.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"John the bookmaker controversy\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "'John' or 'John the bookmaker' is the name given to an Indian bookmaker who in 1994–95 gave money to Australian cricketers Mark Waugh and Shane Warne, in return for pitch and weather information.According to the players, they refused to divulge more-strategic material, such as team tactics and player selection policies. One of the most publicised of a series of betting controversies in cricket in the 1990s, the matter was initially covered up by the Australian Cricket Board (ACB), which decided that it was sufficient to privately fine the players. The ACB concluded that, since Waugh and Warne had previously accused Pakistani cricket captain Saleem Malik of attempting to bribe them to lose matches, their credibility as witnesses would be damaged if their own involvement with John was publicised. The ACB reported the matter to the International Cricket Council, and the matter ended there.When the issue was uncovered by the media in late 1998, the two players were widely condemned by the press and public, as was the ACB for their cover-up. Waugh received a hostile reaction from Australian spectators when he walked out to bat during a Test match immediately after the news broke. On the other hand, the sports community was generally supportive of the players. The ACB appointed Rob O'Regan QC to conduct an independent inquiry into the matter. O'Regan concluded that the fines were inadequate and wrote that a suspension for a 'significant time' would have been a more appropriate penalty. He strongly condemned the players' behaviour and their failure as role models for young fans. O'Regan further added that players needed to be better informed about the dangers of gambling and unauthorised bookmakers.The controversy prompted Pakistan to ask the two Australian players to appear in front of their own judicial inquiry into corruption; Australia responded by granting the Pakistanis permission to hold hearings in Australia with full privileges. The players were questioned about their accusations against Malik, and whether their dealings with John detracted from their credibility. Both Waugh and Warne denied any suggestions they played with less determination in the matches in question, stating that they were among the leading players in those games.Involvement with bookmakerDuring the Singer World Series tournament in Sri Lanka in September 1994, which involved India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Australia, the Australian team stayed at the Oberoi Hotel in the capital Colombo. There was a casino in close proximity to the hotel, which Waugh and Warne visited. Team manager Colin Egar had advised Warne that he had been told that the venue was unsavoury, but he was vague in his comments, and at the time, casinos were not perceived as trouble spots or traps for unwary cricketers.Waugh was approached at the Oberoi by an Indian man, who was also staying at the hotel. The man called himself 'John' and gave no surname. John said he was a man who had won money betting on cricket and asked Waugh to provide pitch and weather information; he also asked the Australian to reveal inside knowledge about the team, such as tactics and player selections, in exchange for US4,000. Waugh accepted the money and agreed to provide information about the pitch and weather, but he refused to divulge the tactics that the Australians intended to use against their opposition, or information on which players would play and what their role would be. Information on pitch conditions provides an insight into the strategies that the team might adopt and which players might be used, and teams will field different players depending on the pitch, as their skills are suited to different conditions. The arrangement with John remained in place until the end of the 1994–95 Australian summer. Waugh later said that at the time, he did not see anything wrong with his actions, reasoning that the agreement was similar to a player speculating about their form and the playing conditions in a pre-match media interview.Waugh also agreed to introduce John to Warne. The meeting occurred at the casino near the team hotel. The trio chatted as Warne was playing roulette; he had a bad night and lost US5,000. John introduced himself to Warne as a person who bet on cricket matches. The next day he invited Warne to his hotel room and, describing himself as a big fan, flattered Warne's leg spinning abilities. Warne accepted a US5,000 gift, with 'no strings attached', which covered his gambling losses. Warne reported that he initially rejected the gift, but accepted the offer at the insistence of John, who said that he would be offended if the offer was declined. Warne later lost this money at the casino. Warne wrote in his autobiography that John told him that he was a wealthy man and that the payment was a token of his appreciation—he had made money by betting on Australian victories in the past.The two players did not tell their teammates or management about the deal, feeling that their interactions with bookmakers would meet with disapproval. They said that they did not feel that their liaisons were harming their team's chances in any way. They remained silent even after they reported Pakistan captain Saleem Malik for attempting to bribe them during the team's subsequent tour of Pakistan. Australian coach Bob Simpson later said that he was unaware of these events, asserting that his anti-betting attitude would have deterred any players from discussing their involvement in such matters with him.Both players kept in contact with John throughout the 1994–95 Australian summer, when England toured for five Tests. Warne spoke with John three times during the season, while Waugh continued to deliver pitch and weather conditions. An inquiry conducted by Rob O'Regan QC in late 1998 and early 1999 concluded the following:Secretly punishedIn early 1995, snippets of information about the world of cricket betting and match-fixing began to be reported by the media. Phil Wilkins of The Sydney Morning Herald reported that an unnamed Pakistani player had attempted to bribe Tim May, Warne and Waugh during Australia's tour of the country in late 1994, immediately after the Singer Trophy. The player was later identified as Saleem Malik, and it was revealed that the Australian trio had privately reported him for offering them money to throw matches.As a result of the media interest, the ACB privately launched an investigation to determine if any Australian players had been involved with bookmakers. Journalists told officials about speculation that an Australian player was having financial dealings with bookmakers, after Mark Ray of the Sunday Age received an anonymous letter alleging that Waugh and Warne were being paid by a bookmaker for information. Following a private investigation opened by team manager Ian McDonald, Waugh and Warne wrote unsigned handwritten statements on 20 February 1995, acknowledging their involvement. The statements were faxed and sent to Graham Halbish, the CEO of the ACB. Warne and Waugh were called to Sydney for an interview with ACB chairman Alan Crompton at the team hotel, where the Australians had assembled before departing for a tour of the West Indies. The pair admitted their involvement with the bookmaker and were fined A10,000 and A8,000 respectively; at the time, these were the highest fines ever imposed on Australian cricketers.The report compiled by Halbish and Crompton was privately forwarded to the ACB's remaining directors and the International Cricket Council (ICC). The ICC was not informed directly; the ACB delivered the news to their chairman Clyde Walcott and chief executive David Richards. Crompton and Halbish did not consult the other board members before making their decision and effectively handed them a fait accompli; they failed to inform their colleagues until the players had left for the West Indies tour.The other board members were told about the matter at the end of the meeting. The minutes of the meeting read:Some board members were uncomfortable with the way the matter was handled. Bob Merriman said that the other board members were 'absolutely pizzled [angry]. I don't know what the vote was because there was nobody there'. Malcolm Gray said that 'it was disgraceful that the Board hadn't been informed before'. Damien Mullins said he thought 'it was poor and unsatisfactory'.Crompton and Halbish knew that if the involvement of Waugh and Warne with bookmakers was revealed, the credibility of the two players as witnesses against the Pakistani captain Malik would be severely questioned, as they too were involved in activities associated with unregistered gambling. There would be significant pressure on the ACB to ban the players, so they decided to cover up the matter. Board member Cam Battersby said, 'The only way he [Malik] was ever going to be convicted was if our evidence was credible ... Revealing the information...would provide an excuse for Pakistan to do nothing'. The ACB prepared a press release in case the matter was leaked. The ACB's legal adviser Graeme Johnson later said that he had told Crompton that they were not obliged to tell the press about the matter.Initially, coach Simpson was not informed; when he found out, he was angry that the ACB had not trusted him enough to tell him what his players had done. Captain Mark Taylor was also aware of the issue by the time he took the team to the West Indies, as were vice-captain Ian Healy and Waugh's brother Steve.AftermathIn December 1998, before the Third Test between Australia and England at the Adelaide Oval, the journalist Malcolm Conn of The Australian uncovered the story of John. His report on the matter won him a Walkley Award for journalism. On 8 December, three days before the start of the Test, Conn informed Malcolm Speed—the CEO of the ACB—that he was going to reveal the details of a cover-up of the fines that were imposed on Waugh. At the time, Conn was unaware of Warne's involvement. The ACB responded by pre-empting Conn and releasing a statement, revealing that two unnamed players had been fined in 1994–95 for having financial dealings with bookmakers. Later that evening, former Test cricketer David Hookes, who was then a sports broadcaster, named Waugh and Warne on the Melbourne radio station 3AW. The next day, Conn's story was released on the front page, with the headline 'Cricket's Betting Scandal'. The article was accompanied by a picture of Waugh with his hand on his head.On the morning of the publication of Conn's article, the managers of Warne and Waugh organised a media conference after Australia's training session. Both players faced a room packed with media and read prepared statements. Both said they had been 'naive and stupid'. Waugh concluded:Much to their discontent, the media were not allowed to ask questions. Patrick Smith of The Age said, 'To deliver such bland explanations to the world media as they did yesterday and then not accept questions was contemptuous of the Australian public they have let down so badly.' The press attention was so intense that when Waugh attempted to relax with a round of golf at a local course, media helicopters flew overhead.The players were widely condemned by the media and public; Prime Minister John Howard stated that he felt an 'intense feeling of disappointment', while former player Neil Harvey called for bans. Malik, whom Warne and Waugh had accused of attempting to bribe them, said that he was delighted at the revelation. The Pakistani player said that the revelations discredited his accusers and vindicated his protestations of innocence. On the preceding tour of Pakistan a few months earlier, Waugh had appeared before a Pakistan Cricket Board judicial inquiry in Lahore to present his claims against Malik; the inquiry questioned the credibility of both Australian players and asked them to return to Pakistan to re-present their accounts of the events.The sports community strongly supported the players. May, the President of the Australian Cricketers' Association, and co-accuser of Malik, pledged his organisation's support for the players, whom he described as 'outstanding servants of Australian cricket'. Waugh received similar statements of support from sports identities. Warne's first Australian captain, Allan Border, defended him, as did former captain and leading commentator Richie Benaud. Sir Don Bradman, widely regarded as the greatest batsman of all time, and former ACB chairman, said that Warne was one of the best influences on Australian cricket for generations, and that the dealings with John did not change this.Media and public opinion was more hostile. The Sydney Morning Herald ran the headline 'Baggy Green Shame' while The Australian wrote of the '11,000 price of disgrace'. Many newspaper columns and letters to the editor attacked the players. The editorial of The Australian stated that 'Waugh and Warne said yesterday they had been naïve and stupid. Put the emphasis on the second adjective—and add greedy.' Readers called for the players to be banned from playing for Australia as well as the sacking of the ACB officials who had kept the matter secret; some said that the players should never be appointed to leadership roles in the cricket community. In the Weekend Australian of 12 December, Warwick Hadfield and Brian Woodley editorialised that 'Warne is in need of some good advice, but not from business managers and PR folk too happy to tell him how wonderful he is in order to flog a few more videos, books, pairs of duds, sports shoes or anti-smoking ads'. Warne's major sponsors reviewed their partnerships with him, and three newspapers, the Daily Mirror of the United Kingdom, The Age of Melbourne and The Sydney Morning Herald severed their ties with him.A few days later, in the wake of the scandal, Waugh was widely jeered by an Australian crowd when he walked out to bat on the first day of the Test. In what he described as the toughest day of his career, Waugh gave an unconvincing and hesitant performance. Waugh managed only seven runs in 36 minutes before being removed by Peter Such, caught and bowled. The cricket writer Peter Roebuck opined that it was the worst home crowd reception for an Australian player that he could remember. Warne was injured at the time and did not play, so he did not have to face the hostile crowd.Later inquiries On 8 January 1999, Pakistan's Judicial Commission held a hearing in Melbourne into bribery and match-fixing. The commission had originally summoned Waugh and Warne to Pakistan but the ACB instead decided to offer them court privileges in Australia. Both Warne and Waugh gave evidence at the public hearing. Waugh seemed nervous and uncertain, whereas Warne appeared assured and confident. They were questioned for approximately 80 and 45 minutes respectively. The Pakistani investigators attempted to link the Australians' dealings with John to various games between Pakistan and Australia in 1994, over which they had suspicions of match-fixing.Immediately after Warne and Waugh had met John in Colombo, Australia defeated Pakistan in a one-day match, scoring 7/179 and restricting Pakistan to 9/151 in reply. There were suspicions that the Pakistanis had thrown the game by batting slowly, although Warne said he had genuinely tried his best, pointing out that he was named man-of-the-match. Warne and May had alleged that Malik offered them money to bowl badly on the final day of the First Test in Karachi. Australia then reduced Pakistan from 3/157 to 9/258, and appeared set for victory, but a last-wicket partnership took them to the target of 314. The win was registered when wicket-keeper Ian Healy missed a stumping chance from Warne and the ball went for four byes. Warne denied that he had thrown the match, again pointing out he was named man-of-the-match. Waugh had alleged that Malik offered him money to help Australia lose a one-day match during the same tour. He denied the allegation that he did so. Waugh scored an unbeaten 121, but it was not enough to prevent Australia from suffering a nine-wicket defeat.Waugh denied betting on cricket, but said he had given John information 'about ten times', contradicting his earlier statement that the pair had only talked on 'a handful' of occasions. Warne testified that he gave pitch and weather information to John before matches three times—a one-day international against England at the Sydney Cricket Ground in December 1994, the Second Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and the Fifth Test at the WACA Ground.Crompton was the last witness. He said that Warne and Waugh's actions 'amounted to a breach of the players' contract in that it brought the game of cricket into disrepute'. He said that it was normal for off-field disciplinary breaches to be dealt with in private, while the fallout of on-field incidents was made public. Compton parried Pakistani accusations that he had covered-up the affair. He said that if the matter had been made public, it would have been confused with bribery. The front-page headline in the Melbourne tabloid Herald Sun subsequently read 'MATCH FIX', accompanied by pictures of Warne and Waugh. The players responded that 'the matter [of the headline] was in the hands of their lawyers'. The next day, the headline read 'INNOCENT'.Following the public outcry over the suppression of the incident, the ACB appointed Rob O'Regan QC to head up a Player Conduct Inquiry. His assistants conducted 60 preliminary interviews and O'Regan made ten himself. O'Regan released his report on 28 February 1999. He described the fines as 'inadequate' as their size 'did not reflect the seriousness of what they had done'. He suggested that a 'suspension for a significant time' was more appropriate.O'Regan said that Australian players were not prepared for playing cricket in Asia, as they were not aware of the dangers of bookmakers and betting on the Indian subcontinent. He recommended that every new player should be warned of the dangers of becoming involved with bookmakers, and the penalties that it entails. The ICC announced that no further action would be taken against Waugh and Warne as they could not be tried twice for the same offence.See alsoBetting controversies in cricketNotesReferencesAustralian cricket in the 20th century Controversies in Australia Cricket controversies Sports betting scandals Sports scandals in Australia", "machine_text": " John the Bookmaker controversy was a major scandal that broke out in the United Kingdom in the early 2000s. It was centred around an individual known as John the Bookmaker, Real name John Quinn, who had operated a prolific betting business throughout the UK including the London Stock Exchange and other high-profile financial institutions. John's activities were uncovered through the findings of an extensive investigation by the Financial Services Authority and other relevant regulatory bodies. It was found that he had operated an illegal bookmaking business, taking bets from a variety of people across different sources, and that he was able to do this through deceptive online tools, a complex network of front companies, and false declarations of income. Furthermore, it was discovered that John had bribed key individuals at the London Stock Exchange and other institutions to help him with his activities. The Exchange, who had long been oblivious to his activities and practices, was deeply embarrassed and angered by the revelations. As a result of this scandal, the FSA was forced to take action and John was fined GBP 5 million. He was also banned from ever placing bets again and was put on an indefinite leave with an immediate cessation of his activities. This case highlighted the vulnerabilities of the UK's financial institutions and the need for better regulatory controls and oversight. In addition to the financial sanctions, this scandal also damaged the reputation of the London Stock Exchange and the UK's financial regulators and raised questions about their effectiveness. It also triggered numerous debates on the regulation of the gambling and betting industry. John the Bookmaker controversy has left a permanent stain on the reputation of the United Kingdom financial world, and it continues to be a source of contention and debate to this day. The controversy has caused online gambling websites and services to be more closely regulated and scrutinised and has also led to stricter regulations on bookmakers and other betting businesses.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 7847834}

It begins at Bülowsvej in Frederiksberg as the direct continuation of Rosenørns Allé/Rolighedsvej and passes through Vanløse before reaching Bellahøj in Brønshøj. A metro station on the Copenhagen Metro City Circle Line is located at Aksel Møllers Have.HistoryIt is unclear when Godthåbsvej was built, but it is one of the oldest roads in the area. Associated with Ladegården, a farm established by Christian IV, although possibly much older, it was the first of several 'royal roads' in the area.From 1664, it was referred to as 'Den gamle Kongevej' ('The Old Royal Road') to distinguish it from New Royal Road (now Gammel Kongevej). It was for centuries also known as the Islevvejen (Islev Road) and later as Granddalsvej (Grøndal Road). From circa 1855, the outer part of the road became known as Godthåbsvej after the country house Store Godthab, which had stood on the side of the road since 1770. The inner part of the street was renamed Rolighedsvej after Rolighed, another country house.More houses began to appear along the inner (eastern) part of the road from the middle of the 19th century. The Classen Terraces were built for indigent workers by the Classenske Fideicommis in 1866–1880.Towards the end of the century many of the low, scattered buildings were replaced by taller blocks.Further out, west of Nordre Fasanvej, the only buildings along the street were a couple of factories and some allotments, which continued well into the 20th century.Notable buildings and residents Aksel Møllers Have (Godthåbsvej 35–41) is a Modernist housing estate built in 1946 to design by Sigurd Tanggaard..

Thorkild Henningsen also designed the slightly younger terraced housing development Fuglebakken 1928–29. It consists of a total of 165 houses located on the streets Godthåbsvej, Duevej, Fuglebakkevej, Drosselvej, Solsortevej, Vagtelvej and Egernvej.Grøndalshuset, on the corner with Sallingevej (No. 2–4) in Vanløse, is a housing estate designed by Frits Schlegel in 1936.Transport Grøndal station (formerly Godthåbsvej station) is located on the border between Frederiksberg and Vanløse.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Bush Doctrine\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Bush Doctrine refers to multiple interrelated foreign policy principles of the 43rd President of the United States, George W. Bush. These principles include unilateralism and the use of preemptive war.Charles Krauthammer first used the phrase in June 2001 to describe the Bush administration's 'unilaterally withdrawing from the ABM treaty and rejecting the Kyoto protocol.' After the 9/11 attack, the phrase described the policy that the United States had the right to secure itself against countries that harbor or give aid to terrorist groups, which was used to justify the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan. The Bush Doctrine became strongly associated with the Bush administration's decision to invade Iraq in 2003.Different pundits have attributed different meanings to the Bush Doctrine. It was used to describe specific policy elements, including a strategy of 'preemptive strikes' as a defense against an immediate or perceived future threat to the security of the United States. This policy principle was applied particularly in the Middle East to counter international terrorist organizations and to justify the invasion of Iraq.Generally, the Bush Doctrine was used to indicate a willingness to unilaterally pursue U.S. economic interests. Some of these policies were codified in a National Security Council text entitled the National Security Strategy of the United States published on September 20, 2002.The phrase 'Bush Doctrine' was rarely used by members of the Bush administration. The expression was used at least once, though, by Vice President Dick Cheney, in a June 2003 speech in which he said, 'If there is anyone in the world today who doubts the seriousness of the Bush Doctrine, I would urge that person to consider the fate of the Taliban in Afghanistan, and of Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq.'National Security Strategy of the United States The main elements of the Bush Doctrine were delineated in a document, the National Security Strategy of the United States, published on September 17, 2002. This document is often cited as the definitive statement of the doctrine. As updated in 2006, it states:Components The Bush Doctrine is defined as 'a collection of strategy principles, practical policy decisions, and a set of rationales and ideas for guiding United States foreign policy.' Some of these had reemerged from the 1992 draft Wolfowitz Doctrine, which had been leaked and disavowed by the first Bush administration; Wolfowitz, as deputy secretary of defense, was at the center of the new Bush administration's strategic planning. Two main pillars are identified for the doctrine: 1.) preemptive strikes against potential enemies and 2.) promoting democratic regime change.The George W. Bush administration claimed that the US was locked in a global war; a war of ideology, in which its enemies are bound together by a common ideology and a common hatred of democracy.Out of the National Security Strategy, four main points are highlighted as the core to the Bush Doctrine: 1.) Preemption, 2.) Military Primacy, 3.) New Multilateralism, and 4.) the Spread of Democracy.The document emphasized preemption, stating, 'America is now threatened less by conquering states than we are by failing ones. We are menaced less by fleets and armies than by catastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few', and required 'defending the United States, the American people, and our interests at home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it reaches our borders.'Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld remarked thus in 2006, in a statement taken to reflect his view of the Doctrine's efficacy: 'If I were rating, I would say we probably deserve a D or D+ as a country as how well we're doing in the battle of ideas that's taking place. I'm not going to suggest that it's easy, but we have not found the formula as a country.'In his 2010 memoir Decision Points, President Bush articulates his discrete concept of the Bush Doctrine. He stated that his doctrine consisted of four 'prongs', three of them practical, and one idealistic. They are the following: (In his words)'Make no distinction between terrorists and the nations that harbor them — and hold both to account.''Take the fight to the enemy overseas before they can attack us again here at home.''Confront threats before they fully materialize.''Advance liberty and hope as an alternative to the enemy's ideology of repression and fear.'Unilateralism Unilateral elements were evident early in Bush's presidency. Conservative Charles Krauthammer, who coined the term 'Bush Doctrine', deployed 'unilateralism', in February 2001 to refer to Bush's increased unilateralism in foreign policy, specifically regarding his decision to withdraw from the ABM treaty.There is some evidence that Bush's willingness for the US to act unilaterally came even earlier. The International Journal of Peace Studies 2003 article 'The Bush administration's image of Europe: From ambivalence to rigidity' states:Attacking countries that harbor terroristsThe doctrine was developed more fully as an executive branch response following the September 11 attacks. The attacks presented a foreign policy challenge, since it was not Afghanistan that had initiated the attacks, and there was no evidence that they had any foreknowledge of them. In an address to the nation on the evening of September 11, Bush stated his resolution of the issue by declaring that, 'We will make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them.' The President made an even more aggressive restatement of this principle in his September 20, 2001 address to a Joint Session of Congress:White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer later wrote in an autobiographical account of that address, 'In a speech hailed by the press and by Democrats, [the President] announced what became known as the 'Bush Doctrine''.The first published reference after the 9/11 attacks to the terror-fighting doctrine appeared September 30 in an op-ed by political scientist Neal Coates.This policy was used to justify the invasion of Afghanistan in October 2001, and has since been applied to American military action against Al Qaeda camps in North-West Pakistan.Pre-emptive strikes Bush addressed the cadets at the U.S. Military Academy (West Point) on June 1, 2002, and made clear the role pre-emptive war would play in the future of American foreign policy and national defense:The stance of the Bush administration was that the harsh measures to spread the democracy worldwide are inevitable and efficacious, in which for instance, liberating Iraq will plant democracy in the area and enable it to flourish in the rest of the Middle East.Two distinct schools of thought arose in the Bush administration regarding how to handle countries such as Iraq, Iran, and North Korea (the so-called 'Axis of Evil' states). Secretary of State Colin Powell and National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, as well as U.S. Department of State specialists, argued for what was essentially the continuation of existing U.S. foreign policy. These policies, developed after the Cold War, sought to establish a multilateral consensus for action (which would likely take the form of increasingly harsh sanctions against the problem states, summarized as the policy of containment). The opposing view, argued by Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and a number of influential Department of Defense policy makers like Paul Wolfowitz and Richard Perle, held that direct and unilateral action was both possible and justified and that America should embrace the opportunities for democracy and security offered by its position as sole remaining superpower.Democratic regime change In several speeches between late 2001 and 2002, Bush expanded on his view of the US foreign policy and global intervention, declaring that the US should actively support democratic governments around the world, especially in the Middle East, as a strategy for combating the threat of terrorism, and that the nation had to act unilaterally in its own security interests, without approval of international bodies like the United Nations. This represented a departure from the Cold War policies of deterrence and containment under the Truman Doctrine and post–Cold War philosophies such as the Powell Doctrine and the Clinton Doctrine.In his 2003 State of the Union Address, Bush declared:After his second inauguration, in a January 2006 speech at National Defense University, Bush said: 'The defense of freedom requires the advance of freedom.'Neoconservatives and the Bush Doctrine held that the hatred for the West and the United States particularly exists not because of actions perpetrated by the US, but rather because the countries from which terrorists emerge are in social disarray and do not experience the freedom that is an intrinsic part of democracy. The Bush Doctrine holds that enemies of the US use terrorism as a war of ideology against the nation. The responsibility of the US is to protect itself by promoting democracy where the terrorists are located so as to undermine the basis for terrorist activities. The Elections in Egypt, Lebnon and Palestine are happened as a result of this initiative in the sense that Brotherhood, Hezbollah and Hamas were allowed participate in it.Influences on the Bush DoctrineNeoconservatives The development of the doctrine was influenced by neoconservative ideology, and it was considered to be a step from the political realism of the Reagan Doctrine. The Reagan Doctrine was considered key to American foreign policy until the end of the Cold War, just before Bill Clinton became president of the United States. The Reagan Doctrine was considered anti-Communist and in opposition to Soviet Union global influence, but later spoke of a peace dividend towards the end of the Cold War with economic benefits of a decrease in defense spending. The Reagan Doctrine was strongly criticizedby the neoconservatives, who also became disgruntled with the outcome of the Gulf War and United States foreign policy under Bill Clinton, sparking them to call for change towards global stability through their support for active intervention and the democratic peace theory. Several central persons in the counsel to the George W. Bush administration considered themselves to be neoconservatives or strongly support their foreign policy ideas.Neoconservatives are widely known to long have supported the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Iraq, and on January 26, 1998, the Project for the New American Century (PNAC) sent a public letter to then-President Bill Clinton stating:Among the signatories to PNAC's original statement of Principals is George H. W. Bush's Vice President Dan Quayle, George W. Bush's defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld, his deputy defense secretary Paul Wolfowitz, his Vice President Dick Cheney, and his brother Jeb Bush.PNAC member and the chairman of the Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee (DPBAC), Neoconservative Richard Perle, later expressed regret over the Iraq invasion and ultimately put the blame for the invasion on President George W. Bush.Other Bush cabinet members who are thought to have adopted neoconservative foreign policy thinking include Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.The Bush Doctrine, in line with long-standing neoconservative ideas, held that the United States is entangled in a global war of ideas between the western values of freedom on the one hand, and extremism seeking to destroy them on the other; a war of ideology where the United States must take responsibility for security and show leadership in the world by actively seeking out the enemies and also change those countries who are supporting enemies.The Bush Doctrine, and neoconservative reasoning, held that containment of the enemy as under the realpolitik of Reagan did not work, and that the enemy of United States must be destroyed pre-emptively before they attack—using all the United States' available means, resources and influences to do so.On the book Winning the War on Terror Dr. James Forest, U.S. Military Academy Combating Terrorism Center at West Point, comments: 'While the West faces uncertainties in the struggle against militant Islam's armies of darkness, and while it is true that we do not yet know precisely how it will end, what has become abundantly clear is that the world will succeed in defeating militant Islam because of the West's flexible, democratic institutions and its all-encompassing ideology of freedom.'Natan SharanskyAnother part of the intellectual underpinning of the Bush Doctrine was the 2004 book The Case for Democracy, written by Israeli politician and author Natan Sharansky and Israeli Minister of Economic Affairs in the United States Ron Dermer, which Bush has cited as influential in his thinking. The book argues that replacing dictatorships with democratic governments is both morally justified, since it leads to greater freedom for the citizens of such countries, and strategically wise, since democratic countries are more peaceful, and breed less terrorism than dictatorial ones.Expanding United States influence Princeton University research fellow Dr. Jonathan Monten, in his 2005 International Security journal article 'The Roots of the Bush Doctrine: Power, Nationalism, and Democracy Promotion in U.S. Strategy', attributed the Bush administration's activist democracy promotion to two main factors: the expansion of material capabilities, and the presence of a nationalist domestic ideology. He claims that the Bush Doctrine promotion of democracy abroad was held as vital by the Bush administration to the success of the United States in the 'war on terror'. It was also a key objective of the administration's grand strategy of expanding the political and economic influence of the United States internationally. He examines two contending approaches to the long-term promotion of democracy: 'exemplarism', or leadership by example, and 'vindicationism', or the direct application of United States power, including the use of coercive force. Whereas exemplarism largely prevailed in the 20th century, vindicationism has been the preferred approach of the Bush administration.Criticism and analysis The Bush Doctrine resulted in criticism and controversy.Peter D. Feaver, who worked on the Bush national security strategy as a staff member on the National Security Council, said he has counted as many as seven distinct Bush doctrines. One of the drafters of the National Security Strategy of the United States, which is commonly mistakenly referred to as the 'Bush Doctrine', demurred at investing the statement with too much weight. 'I actually never thought there was a Bush doctrine', said Philip D. Zelikow, who later served as State Department counselor under Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. 'Indeed, I believe the assertion that there is such a doctrine lends greater coherence to the administration's policies than they deserve.' Zbigniew Brzezinski, Jimmy Carter's national security adviser, said he thought there was no 'single piece of paper' that represents the Bush Doctrine.Experts on geopolitical strategy note that Halford Mackinder's theories in 'The Geographical Pivot of History' about the 'Heartland' and world resource control are still as valid today as when they were formulated.In his 2007 book In the Defense of the Bush Doctrine, Robert G. Kaufman wrote: 'No one grasped the logics or implications of this transformation better than Halford Mackinder. His prescient theories, first set forth in Geographical Pivot of History, published in 1904, have rightly shaped American grand strategy since World War II. Mackinder warned that any single power dominating Eurasia, 'the World Island', as he called it, would have the potential to dominate the world, including the United States.' Kaufman is a political scientist, public policy professor and member of The Shadow Financial Regulatory Committee. He said in an interview about the book: 'I wrote this book because of my conviction that the Bush Doctrine has a more compelling logic and historical pedigree than people realize.'The Bush Doctrine was polarizing both domestically and internationally. In 2008, polls showed there was more anti-Americanism than before the Bush administration formed the Bush Doctrine; this increase was probably, at least partially, a result of implementing the Bush Doctrine and conservative foreign policy.Foreign interventionismThe foreign policy of the Bush Doctrine was subject to controversy both in the United States and internationally.John J. Mearsheimer argues in his book, The Great Delusion: Liberal Dreams and International Realities that a liberal hegemonic policy like the Bush Doctrine is ineffective at achieving its stated end goals and is doomed to lead to more war, anti-Americanism, and a global retreat in democracy.Some critics of the policies were suspicious of the increasing willingness of the United States to use military force unilaterally.Robert W. Tucker and David C. Hendrickson argued that it reflects a turn away from international law, and marks the end of American legitimacy in foreign affairs.Others have stated that it could lead to other states resorting to the production of WMDs or terrorist activities.This doctrine is argued to be contrary to the just war theory and would constitute a war of aggression. Patrick J. Buchanan wrote that the 2003 invasion of Iraq had significant similarities to the 1996 neoconservative policy paper A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm.Political scientist Karen Kwiatkowski in 2007 wrote on her article 'Making Sense of the Bush Doctrine':We are killing terrorists in self-defense and for the good of the world, you see. We are taking over foreign countries, setting them up with our favorite puppets 'in charge,' controlling their economy, their movements, their dress codes, their defensive projects, and their dreams, solely because we love them, and apparently can't live without them.Radical departure According to Buchanan and others, the Bush Doctrine was a radical departure from former United States foreign policies, and a continuation of the ideological roots of neoconservatism.Initially, support for the United States was high, but by the end of the Bush administration, after seven years of war, anti-Americanism was high and criticism of the Bush Doctrine was widespread; nonetheless the doctrine still had support among some United States political leaders.The representation of prominent neoconservatives and their influences on the Bush Doctrine had been highly controversial among the American public.Critics, like John Micklethwait in the book The Right Nation, claim that Bush was deceived by neoconservatives into adopting their policies.Polarization Anti-war critics have claimed that the Bush Doctrine was strongly polarizing domestically, had estranged allies of the United States, and belied Bush's stated desire to be a 'uniter, not a divider'.Compassionate belief and religious influence Bush often talked about his belief in compassionate conservatism and liberty as 'God's gift'. In his Claremont Institute article Democracy and the Bush Doctrine, Charles R. Kesler wrote, 'As he begins his second term, the president and his advisors must take a hard, second look at the Bush Doctrine. In many respects, it is the export version of compassionate conservatism.'Sociopsychological strategy and effects There is also criticism on Bush Doctrine practices related to their sociopsychological effects saying they create a culture of fear.Naomi Klein wrote in her book The Shock Doctrine about a recurrent metaphor of shock, and she claimed in an interview that the Bush administration continued to exploit a 'window of opportunity that opens up in a state of shock', followed by a comforting rationale for the public, as a form of social control.Democratization Some commentators argue that the Bush Doctrine has not aimed to support genuine democratic regimes driven by local peoples, but rather US-friendly regimes installed by diplomats acting on behalf of the United States, and intended only to seem democratic to U.S. voters. For example, in the case of Afghanistan, it is argued that parliamentary democracy was downplayed by the US and power concentrated in the hands of the Afghan president Hamid Karzai, a US ally. The election of Karzai has been described as the result of manipulation on the parts of the US government and US policy maker Zalmay Khalilzad. At the same time, these commentators draw attention to the number of unpopular (but US-friendly) warlords achieving 'legitimating' positions under US supervision of the elections. Some commentators interpreted voter turnout figures as evidence of 'large-scale fraud'. Sonali Kolhatkar and James Ingalls have written, 'It remains to be seen if U.S. policy makers will ever allow anything approaching democracy to break out in Afghanistan and interfere with their plans.'Of the elections in Afghanistan, Sima Samar, former Afghan Minister for Women's Affairs, stated, 'This is not a democracy, it is a rubber stamp. Everything has already been decided by the powerful ones.'Most studies of American intervention have been pessimistic about the history of the United States exporting democracy. John A. Tures examined 228 cases of American intervention from 1973 to 2005, using Freedom House data. While in 63 cases a country did become more democratic, in 69 instances the country became less democratic - and the plurality of interventions, 96, caused no change in the country's democracy.See alsoAmerican imperialismMonroe DoctrineTruman DoctrineCarter DoctrineClinton DoctrineJus ad bellumMilitary interventionObama DoctrinePowell DoctrineReagan DoctrineForeign policy of the Donald Trump administrationThe One Percent DoctrineUnited States Presidential doctrinesWar on TerrorismWeinberger DoctrineWolfowitz DoctrineReferencesFurther readingBacevich, Andrew J.

Bush. This strategy was rooted in the idea of preemptive military action in order to protect the security of the United States, an approach that was first proclaimed in a 2002 speech given by President Bush following the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001. The Bush Doctrine was heavily influenced by the ideal of American exceptionalism- the idea that, as the most powerful nation in the world, the U.S. has the right, responsibility, and capacity to intervene in international disputes and protect global peace. Additionally, the Bush Doctrine states that all individuals and nations should exercise their right to self-defense, as long as it upholds the principle of fairness and reciprocity. As such, the Bush Doctrine incites preventive military action, as opposed to simply responding to threats after they have occurred. At its core, the Bush Doctrine is largely composed of two main elements- The first one is the broad geopolitical concept known as 'Forward Strategy', where the U.S. engages its geopolitical rivals, such as the Global War on Terror and the War in Iraq, directly with immediate military action. The second element of the doctrine is known as the 'Bush Military Doctrine', which is a more aggressive stance that stresses the need for the U.S. to be militarily ready to deal with any potential aggressor at all times. In an attempt to enforce the Bush Doctrine, the U.S. launched its own military operations, nation-rebuilding efforts, and economic sanctions in affected regions. This included increased U.S. military presence in areas such as the Middle East, as well as the introduction of various counter-terrorism, intelligence-gathering, and global surveillance initiatives. Apart from this, the U.S. also introduced a number of measures aimed at promoting democracy abroad, such as free elections and economic development programs. The Bush Doctrine has been met with both criticism and praise. Critics have voiced concerns regarding the legality and morality of preemptive military action, while others have argued that the approach is a necessary response to international threats. Supporters of the Bush Doctrine, however, see the policy as a logical step towards ensuring global security and protecting the interests of the United States. Despite its ongoing controversy, the Bush Doctrine is still seen as an integral part of the U.S. foreign policy. It has become a major benchmark used to measure the international priorities of today's superpower and continues to shape the foreign policy of the United States.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 88529}

The border control counted more than 950,000 border crossings in 2004. In April 2007, the construction of apaved road from Choir to Zamyn-Üüd via Sainshand began. Completion is planned for October 2007. However, completion of the road project was pushed back to 2013, with Sainshand to Choir section being finished in September, 2013. A new expanded road border crossing was also completed in 2013 to relieve delays in crossing from China to Mongolia.The 'Zamyn-Uud' Free Economic Zone was officially created in 2004.

It is the capital of the Dornogovi Province, and is the third largest city in Mongolia with a population of approximately 33,000. The city was originally founded in the 1880s by a small group of nomads who settled on the Tumurkhuul River, a tributary of the Nariin Gol. The town's principal industry is animal husbandry, due to its proximity to China and strong relationships with Chinese markets. Its close economic ties to China have contributed to Zamyn-Üüd's steady population population growth and economic development. Other industries in the city include mARkets for cashmere production, weaving, fur trading, tanning, and honey production. The town also has a small industrial zone and a few large factories, such as coal and brass production. The city is served by Zamyn-Üüd Airport, located around 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) south-east of the city centre. The airport is the second busiest international airport in Mongolia, and serves Gobi desert and Central Asian sleeper trains. The main attraction in the area is the Gobi Desert. The desert has long been an important source of inspiration for Mongolian nomads, who travel here are to hunt for steppe animals, ride horses, and meet with other nomads. Tourists can also visit the nearby Yoliin Am Canyon, the beautiful Ongi Monastery, the Erdene-Zuu Monastery, and Tsagaan Suvarga, an impressive cliff formation. Zamyn-Üüd is also home to several prestigious universities, such as the National University of Mongolia and Mongolian University of Science and Technology. The city's culture is also quite vibrant, and many traditional festivals, such as Tsagaan Sar and Naadam, are held here annually. Though the city has experienced economic growth over the last few decades, some of its citizens are still living in poverty. The city's infrastructure and services remain largely inadequate for its flourishing population. Despite its economic challenges, Zamyn-Üüd is nevertheless one of the most popular destinations in Mongolia.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 11760934}

Schoch graduated from South Park High School in Buffalo, New York, then worked for several years as a railroad clerk, saving money during the Great Depression so that he could attend college. He enrolled in Virginia Polytechnic Institute in Blacksburg, Virginia, and graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering and a 2nd Lieutenant’s commission in the United States Army.Having learned to fly at VPI through the ROTC program, he wanted to fly fighter aircraft. He thought his chances of being able to do so were better in the Navy than in the Army, so upon graduation in the spring of 1941, he resigned his Army commission, enrolled in the Navy Reserve as a Seaman 2nd Class, and, having already learned to fly in VPI’s ROTC program, was quickly accepted into the Navy’s flight training program.World War IIOnce he’d earned his pilot’s wings in the Navy, Schoch was assigned to Fighting Squadron 19, then forming for anticipated combat against the Japanese in the Pacific as part of Air Group 19. With his engineering degree, Schoch was designated as the squadron engineering officer, and flew 46 combat missions with the squadron from the USS Lexington (CV-16) in the summer and fall of 1944.Flying the Grumman F6F Hellcat, he shot down four Japanese aircraft during the squadron's combat tour, and hit a Japanese aircraft carrier with a bomb, during the Battle of Leyte Gulf.After his combat tour, in January 1945, Schoch was assigned to Fighter-Bomber Squadron 150, which was forming in the United States, in preparation for an invasion of Japan in 1945. He began training, once again as the engineering officer, in the new Vought F4U-4 at bases on the east coast of the U. S. and aboard the newly commissioned USS Lake Champlain (CV-39). Japan’s surrender made both the invasion and Fighter-Bomber Squadron 150 unnecessary.The war ended before either the squadron or the aircraft carrier saw combat duty, and Schoch left the Navy in November 1945.McDonnell careerSchoch was hired immediately after the war by McDonnell Aircraft Corporation as an aeronautical engineer and quickly moved up to a test pilot position as the company grew. He was the tenth pilot to fly the company’s FH-1 Phantom, the U.S. Navy’s first jet fighter to be carrier-qualified. He was the second pilot to fly the F2H Banshee, the Phantom’s successor. The Phantom never saw combat service, but the Banshee was widely used during the Korean War (1950–1953) as a reconnaissance aircraft.Schoch was the only pilot to fly the company’s XF-85 Goblin, at what is now Edwards Air Force Base. The Goblin was an experimental “parasite” fighter contemplated for use by the U. S. Air Force in conjunction with the B-36 bomber. With the giant bomber still unavailable at the inception of the test program, for the test phase the special 'trapeze' needed to launch and recover the small fighter was fitted on a Boeing EB-29.Flying the Goblin required skill, due to the difficulty of the hook-up manoeuvre and the lack of proper landing gear if hook up was not completed.

The crash site is about 60 miles northwest of St. Louis.ReferencesExternal linksIllustrated Biography of Edwin Foresman Schoch Dropping A Smaller Fighter From The Bomb Bay – The Out-Of-This-World XF-85 Goblin Parasite in the Sky1916 births 1951 deaths People from Oakmont, Pennsylvania United States Navy officers United States Navy pilots of World War II Virginia Tech alumni American test pilots American aerospace engineers Military personnel from Pennsylvania Victims of aviation accidents or incidents in 1951", "machine_text": " Edwin Foresman Schoch (October 10, 1916 - August 12, 2004) was an American Air Force officer who was awarded the Silver Star for heroism in combat during World War II.

On August 1, 1944 while leading a squadron of P-51 Mustang fighters on a mission near Odertal, Germany, his aircraft was hit by anti-aircraft fire. Although wounded, Schoch was able to return his squadron safely back to their base. He was awarded the Silver Star for heroism and selfless devotion to duty. Following the war, Schoch remained in the Air Force and rose to the rank of colonel. In 1952, he was assigned to the National Military Establishment in Washington, DC and later, in 1956, the National Security Council. During this time, he was involved in developing plans for the nuclear arsenals of the United States and was known as an expert in aerospace defense policy.

It was established in 1935 and occupies most of 9 Fitzmaurice Place, a street connecting Berkeley Square to Curzon Street in Mayfair.HistoryThe club formed later than many London clubs, and it permitted women from its inception. It has always had a relatively young membership, with an active social scene. The building's main Adam and otherwise 1930s Art Deco interiors, with some authentic frontages, mean it has been Grade II* listed since its first assessment in 1970. This is the mid-category of listed building, a statutory scheme of protection which has a pyramidal hierarchy.In 1930, Westminster City Council decided to improve access to Berkeley Square by creating an extra road into the square. This was accomplished by demolishing half of the main range of Lansdowne House, which stood since the 1760s. What remained was given a new frontage and a newly renovated interior, and became the Lansdowne Club. The 'First Drawing Room' was thus taken to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and the 'Dining Room' exists in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.The venue was founded as a 'social, residential and athletic Club for members of social standing' and their families, and unlike many rivals, it had no vocational, artistic, or political 'theme'. Its facilities include a ballroom, a terrace, a fencing Salle and a basement gym with Art Deco swimming pool. Internally architecture is extremely unusual; some is modern for its type, being significantly Art Deco, as opposed to Georgian/Victorian/Edwardian styles. The Adam Room and other parts of the club on the ground floor are Georgian though.The building underwent extensive renovation and further modernisation in 2000.

Thaksin and his Thai Rak Thai (TRT) party vehemently denied the accusations and sued the accusers.The leaders of the 2006 military coup claimed Thaksin's alleged disloyalty as one of their rationales for seizing power.BackgroundProtests against Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra increased throughout 2005 and 2006 due to a variety of factors, including his April 2005 appearance at a merit-making ceremony at the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, the September 2005 cancellation of Sondhi Limthongkul's Muangthai Raisabdah television show, Thaksin's November 2005 plan to give local communities control of public schools, Thaksin's sale of Shin Corporation in January 2006, and Thaksin's alleged role in the March 2006 destruction of the Phra Phrom Erawan shrine.Finland PlotIn May 2006, on the eve of King Bhumibol Adulyadej's 60th anniversary celebrations, the Sondhi Limthongkul-owned Manager Daily newspaper published the details of what it called the 'Finland Plan,' 'Finland Declaration,' or 'Finland Strategy.'The articles claimed that Thaksin and former student leaders of Thailand's 1970s democratic movement met in Finland in 1999 to develop a plan to institute rule by a single party, overthrow the monarchy and establish a republic, and hold elections for provincial governors.The 5-part article was titled 'Finland Strategy: Thailand's Revolution Plan?' was written by Pramote Nakhonthap and appeared on 17, 19, 22, 23 and 24 May 2006. Thaksin's alleged co-conspirators apparently included Thai Rak Thai party members Prommin Lertsuridej (Secretary-General to the Premier), Chaturon Chaisaeng (Deputy Prime Minister), Surapong Suebwonglee (Minister of Information and Communications Technology), Adisorn Piangket (Former Deputy Science Minister), Sutham Saengprathum (Deputy Interior Minister), and Phumtham Wechayachai (Deputy Transport Minister), all of whom had been affiliated with the Communist Party of Thailand following the massacre of 6 October 1976.The allegations were taken up by several prominent critics, including leaders of the People's Alliance for Democracy, constitution drafter Chai-anan Samudavanija, Senator Sophon Supapong, writer Pramote Nakornthab, and Democrat leader Thaworn Senniam.None of the accusers provided any evidence to back up their allegations.Sondhi noted that his source was a Thai Rak Thai worker who had recently 'defected.'Variations and denialsVariations of the original theory were also proposed, including the claim that the plot involved overseas groups intent on overthrowing the Chakri dynasty, the claim that media consolidation was a core component of the conspiracy, the claim that the Plan was aimed at maintaining a constitutional monarchy while reducing the powers of the monarch to a mere figurehead, and the claim that a law designed to further decentralize central administrative power to the Thai provinces, and the claim that Thaksin wanted to establish a government based on the model of western democracies.Another variation claimed that Thaksin's co-conspirators were former members of the Communist Party of Thailand including Deputy Transport Minister Phumtham Wechayachai and had applied a theory of orthodox Marxism to map out the TRT strategy to promote capitalism.This variation claimed that Thailand during the 1970s was still a semi-feudal society and needed to become a capitalist society as part of the transition to socialism.The communists then worked with Thaksin to fully develop Thailand's capitalist economic system, destroy all remnants of feudalism, and privatize state-owned assets, while at the same time establishing a single-party dictatorship, all in order to create a socialist dictatorship.The allegations were roundly denied by Thaksin Shinawatra and the leadership of his Thai Rak Thai party, including Surapong Suebwonglee and Prommin Lertsuridej.On 30 May, Thaksin Shinawatra and Thana Benjathikul, a lawyer from the Thai Rak Thai party, sued Sondhi, editor Khunthong Lorserivanich, columnist Pramote Nakhonthap, executive Saowalak Thiranujanyong, and webmaster Panjapat Angkhasuwan for libel.The lawsuit alleged that the articles were intended to ruin Thai Rak Thai and Thaksin's political future by making the public believe the party was planning to overturn the constitutional monarchy.Thaksin's lawsuit attracted criticism and claims that Thaksin was trying to censor the media.Impact of the allegationsThe allegations damaged the popularity of Thaksin and his government.Thaksin was forced to expend a significant amount of time and political capital on damage control, explaining his position and swearing his loyalty to the monarchy.In an editorial, the influential anti-Thaksin newspaper The Nation noted:The Nation noted that the actual existence of the Plot was not important—the mere invocation of royalty would be enough to damage the Thai Rak Thai party.Many commentators noted the similarity between the Finland Plot allegations and the allegations used justify the massacre of students on 6 October 1976, which in the context of the Thailand political crisis, might justify a military coup.The Thai military eventually successfully executed a coup against the Thaksin government on 19 September 2006.One of the junta's stated rationales for the coup was that Thaksin had insulted the King.ReferencesPolitics of Thailand Conspiracy theories in Asia Conspiracy theories in Thailand 2006 in Thailand Communism in Thailand Thaksin Shinawatra Republicanism in Thailand Historical events in Finland", "machine_text": " The Finland Plot (or Skutsi plot) was a thwarted plan to overthrow the Finnish government by pro-Nazi Finnish nationalists during World War II. The plan was foiled by Finnish Prime Minister and leader of the White Finnish government, J.K. Paasikivi, who succeeded in preventing the coup from happening. The Finland Plot was a plan initiated by the Finnish pro-Nazi organization Skutsi, which aimed to overthrow the White Finnish government and install a pro-Nazi puppet government. The plan was guided by Swedish-born Nazi sympathiser Ian Aspelin and other leading figures in the organization. Many of the people involved in the plan were active members of the Lapua Movement, an extremist, right-wing organization in Finland which was formed in 1929 and was known to be hostile towards the government. The plot was reportedly developed in the spring of 1941, and involved the arrest of Prime Minister Paasikivi and other leading figures of the White Finnish government. The plot also called for the assassination of several prominent Finnish politicians, and the destruction of multiple government buildings and military infrastructure. At the end of 1940, Prime Minister Paasikivi and other members of the White Finnish government were alerted to the Finland Plot by intelligence reports from the Soviet Union. The Finnish government subsequently took steps to prevent the coup from taking place, arresting members of Skutsi, and placing the movement under surveillance. In addition to preventing the coup, Prime Minister Paasikivi was able to use the plot to pressure pro-Nazi factions to accept Finnish neutrality in World War II. Paasikivi’s strategies resulted in the White Finnish government maintaining their position of neutrality throughout the war, despite Nazi Germany's continued attempts to pressure Finland into joining the war effort on their side. The plot also helped Prime Minister Paasikivi to consolidate his rule and strengthen the legitimacy of the White Finnish government which he led. By foiling the Finland plot and thwarting the plans of extremist nationalists, Paasikivi was able to maintain control of the Finnish government during World War II, leading the country to victory. The Finland Plot is seen as a key event in Finnish history, and is credited with helping the country to maintain their neutrality during World War II and protect their independence from both the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. The success of the Finnish government in foiling the plot is often held up as a testament to the wisdom and leadership of Prime Minister Paasikivi.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 7042983}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Battle for Cebu City\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Battle for Cebu City (Filipino: Labanan sa Lungsod ng Cebu; Cebuano: Gubat sa Dakbayan sa Sugbo; Japanese: セブシティーのための戦い) was a major engagement of World War II that occurred between March 26 and April 8, 1945, during the second Philippines Campaign. The battle resulted in an Allied victory over the occupying Japanese Army and the liberation of Cebu City.PreludeAfter launching their campaign to recapture the Philippines at Leyte in October 1944, the Allies followed up that victory by dispatching troops to Luzon in January 1945. A month later, General Douglas MacArthur, overall commander of Allied forces in the Pacific, began planning to take the rest of the Philippines. General Robert L. Eichelberger's Eighth Army was then tasked with conducting a series of amphibious landings in the southern Philippines on islands between Mindanao and Luzon, including Cebu. Prior to the war, Cebu had been the Philippines second-most important industrial center, and it offered the Allies a harbor for future operations.The island was garrisoned by a force of between 14,500 and 15,000 Japanese troops. These were situated mainly in Cebu City and on the central east coast. Drawn from the 35th Army, the majority of these troops were support troops who had been supporting the evacuation of Luzon, and who were formed into combat units. The main Japanese combat units were the 102nd Infantry Division, which consisted of the 78th Infantry Brigade headquarters and the 173d Independent Infantry Battalion, and 1st Division, consisting of the 1st, 49th and 57th Infantry Regiments, which were down to battalion strength due to earlier fighting on Luzon. There were also several naval garrison units on the island, including the 33rd Special Base Force and the 36th Guard Unit.BattleFollowing a preliminary bombardment, the battle began on March 26, 1945, when the Allies launched Operation Victor II. Staging out of Leyte, where they had conducted rehearsal landings two days earlier, a large flotilla of cruisers and destroyers from the Seventh Fleet Task Force 74 escorted the Cebu Attack Group to the island. Under the leadership of Major General William H. Arnold, the forces assigned to the operation consisted of the Americal Division's 132nd and 182nd Infantry Regiments, totaling about 5,000 men, were landed on Cebu island at Talisay Beach,southwest of Cebu City. The 182nd came ashore southwest of the city, while the 132nd landed at a wide gravel beach to the northeast opposite a palm grove. Meeting no Japanese opposition, the U.S. forces nevertheless suffered heavily from mines and booby traps as they crossed the beach. It was the first time in the Philippines campaign that U.S. troops had encountered such weapons.As further waves landed, engineers and infantry began clearing lanes through the mine fields. The Americal Division slowly forced its way off the beach and moved inland against only small pockets of Japanese resistance that were carrying out delaying actions. The main body stopped for the night aboutfrom Cebu City. Patrols were sent out and the following day, the Americal Division continued its advance towards Cebu City, tasked with securing the harbor and nearby airfield, Lahug Airfield, positionednortheast of the city. On March 28, more significant fighting broke out as the Americans captured the airfield, as well as Mactan Island in Cebu Harbor. Although the city had been officially liberated, Japanese forces remained in many parts, including the port area, and occupied several strongly defended positions in the hills to the city's north, where they came under the command of Major-General Takeo Manjome, who had previously commanded the 78th Infantry Brigade. At this time, Japanese resistance grew more determined and heavy fighting followed.Around 8,500 local Cebuano guerrilla and irregular forces, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel James M. Cushing took part . Units fought on the outskirts of Cebu, capturing Pari-an on March 29 and liberating T. Padilla on April 7. As Allied morale heightened and Japanese forces withdrew to the ports, the U.S. naval commander, Ferdinand Ernest Zuellig, directed naval bombardments on the ports, prompting the Japanese to withdraw to Fort San Pedro. Many did not make it and were trapped within Piers One and Two.Although the final operations around the ports were successful and forced many Japanese to surrender, the Japanese headquarters unit in charge of the area made a final stand near the border of Mandaue City. Led by Major Rijome Kawahara, after further fighting these forces were defeated, and after that the Allies gained control of the remaining areas of the city as Kawahara's remaining troops withdrew. Kawahara was killed while trying to cross the makeshift bridge towards Mandaue City. Reportedly, he was killed by a sniper after being incapacitated by mortar and tank fire. Kawahara was posthumously promoted to the rank of colonel.After the war, his body was returned to Japan where it was buried in Sapporo, the city of his birth.AftermathDuring the final stages of the battle, the mountainous parts of Cebu were also bombed and cleared. A series of battles were subsequently fought during this time, the most famous of which is the Battle of Gochan Hill, fought over three days from March 29. Battling against a heavily entrenched force, the fighting proved costly for the 182d Infantry Regiment, with one company losing over 50 men killed when the Japanese blew up an ammunition dump, before the U.S. forces finally took the hill, having destroyed at least 85 pillboxes.Supported by naval gunfire, the Americal Division attempted to break through the Japanese line through a frontal assault, but their attempts resulted in slow progress, so plans were made to outflank them. In early April two battalions from the Americal Division's third regiment, the 164th, were dispatched to Cebu as reinforcements. These were moved in great secrecy around the Japanese lines and on 13 April, the Americans put in a two-pronged divisional level attack, which although initially checked, eventually forced the Japanese commander, Manjome, to withdraw further north into the mountains. Meanwhile, on April 20 the 164th Infantry's third battalion landed on the island of Bohol, and in concert with Filipino troops and guerillas began clearance operations, before being moved to Negros on April 20; they were subsequently joined by the regiment's other two battalions on 25 April.On Cebu, after a brief pause, the Allied forces began to follow up the retreating Japanese on April 20. Filipino troops and Cebuano guerillas continued harassment operations. The Americal Division ceased operations on June 20, when they withdrew to Cebu City to begin preparations for future operations. Meanwhile, the guerillas continued to keep pressure on the remaining Japanese. The entire Cebu campaign ended on July 2, after Camp 8 had fallen. The Americans subsequently developed a large logistics base on the island, Base 'S', which was intended to be used by three infantry divisions as a staging base for the proposed invasion of Japan.Around 5,550 Japanese were killed during the fighting, while the Americal Division lost 410 men killed and 1,700 wounded; a further 8,000 U.S. troops became sick during the battle. The Filipino forces under the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary lost about 3,600 killed and 6,200 wounded. About 8,500 Japanese were able to escape into Cebu's north, where they remained until the war ended in August.ControversyA number of controversies surround this battle. The most famous is why General Sosaku Suzuki, commander of the IJA 35th Army which was responsible for the forces on Cebu, was not in command of the Japanese troops in the city and where he was during the height of the battle. One theory that has developed is that during the liberation of the city on March 27, Suzuki had already fled to the hills and mountains of Cebu City, hoping to make a last stand against the invading joint US and Philippine forces, resulting in the Battle of Gochan Hill. His orders for the defense of the city are believed to have been formulated earlier and the plan was made was given to Kawahara who, at that time, was the highest-ranking Japanese officer in the city, was entrusted with defending the city to the last man standing. As the mountainous parts of Cebu were being cleared by Allied forces, so too were the city outposts and barangays. When Suzuki transferred to the IJA garrison in the Cadulawan-Tubod area around Minglanilla, after fleeing from the destroyed mountain camps, on April 8, 1945, he received a mail that Kawahara had been killed while defending the city, and that the whole city, its ports and the nearby barangays had been captured by the Allies. Because of this, he began planning his escape.On April 14, 1945, the Allies began an assault on the Japanese bases in the Cadulawan-Tubod area, as well the elimination of the defenses set up by the IJA in Pungtod, Calajo-an, and the Port of Tulay-Tungkop in what later became known as the 'Battle of Minglanilla' and the 'Defense of Calajo-an'. Spearheaded by US troops from 'G' Company, 182nd Infantry Regiment and some local soldiers from the Philippine Commonwealth military and Cebuano guerrillas, the battle lasted for two days, clearing the IJA from Minglanilla. To care for the wounded, Allied forces set-up four wards, called Allied Service Stations and Mobile Allied Service hospitals, in the area and this is the reason why today there are barangays in Minglanilla named Poblacion Ward I to Ward 4.The first stronghold, Camp 7, was cleared on April 15, but the bastion, Camp 8, was not cleared until July 2, marking the liberation of the entire Cebu from the Japanese. By the time the battle was at its height on April 10, Suzuki fled south in an effort to avoid capture and rejoin the main part of his command on Mindanao, in the southern Philippines. On April 19, while sailing in a convoy of small ships, Suzuki was killed when the ship he was in was attacked by U.S. aircraft between Sumilon Island Sound and Santander Bay.See alsoMilitary History of the Philippines during World War IIReferencesCitationsBibliography, see chapter entitled 'World powers at play in the western Pacific : the coastal fortifications of Southern Cebu, Philippines.'External linksPacific Wrecks' websiteMorning Times for Cebu City on 5 May 1945GENE SLOVERS US NAVY PAGESExcerpts of Tabunan:The Untold Exploits of the Famed Cebu Guerillas of World War II by Col.

It was fought between Combined US- Filipino forces under the command of Lieutenant General Robert Eichelberger, and Japanese forces commanded by General Masami Omura. The battle was a key event in the Battle of the Visayas, an amphibious assault campaign by Eichelberger’s Eighth Army tasked with ensuring Japanese forces on the Visayas islands would be unable to link up with their comrades on the island of Leyte. The attempted to recapture the islands of Cebu and Negros, both of which had been occupied by the Japanese since early 1942. On the morning of March 28, Eichelberger's forces began their invasion at Barrio Tinago near Parian Point, a few kilometers south of Cebu City. Taking advantage of the element of surprise, US Landing Craft Tanks surged onto the beach and opened fire, shelling the surprised Japanese outposts. Heavy bombardment from US battleships continued throughout the day and into March 29, further aiding in the Allied forces taking control of the Beachhead. Despite US naval and air superiority, the Japanese still put up a fight, launching airstrikes and engaging US forces in hand-to-hand combat. On April 3, US tanks breached the heavily defended walls of Cebu City, and continued to take the city's northern outskirts. Fighting became fiercer, Japanese forces breaking out and launching hit-and-run raids on US troops. On April 16, the fighting finally came to a close, with the remaining Japanese forces retreating to the mountains and Eichelberger’s forces securing the city. In all, the battle cost 400American casualties and approximately 7200 Japanese casualties, making it the most costly battle the Japanese had suffered to date in the Battle of the Visayas. The Battle for Cebu City was a vital step in the Allied victory in the Battle of the Visayas and in the overall defeat of Japan in World War II. Its victory proved key to US-Filipino efforts to gain control of the Visayas, strengthen morale in the surrounding regions, and pave the way for liberation of the Philippine Islands from Japanese control.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 39418689}

The two components together form the eleventh cranial nerve, known as the accessory nerve. The accessory nerve originates in the cervical spinal cord, in the primary nuclei of motor neurons located in the anterior horn of the spinal cord at the level of C1 to C5. The primary nuclei give rise to motor neurons which have axons that travel from the level of the spinal cord to form a single root at the level of the upper cervical spine. This is known as the spinal root of accessory nerve. The function of the spinal root of the accessory nerve is to innervate the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles of the neck, which allows for movement in the neck and shoulders. The sternocleidomastoid muscle allows for lateral flexion of the neck, while the trapezius muscle is responsible for movements such as shoulder elevation and upper body rotation. The spinal root of the accessory nerve is often injured during traumatic whiplash or due to traction or compression injuries. Damage to the spinal root of the accessory nerve results in a condition known as spinal accessory neuropathy, which is characterized by weakness or paralysis of the neck and shoulder muscles. Treatment options for spinal accessory neuropathy may include physical therapy to help strengthen the weakened muscles, or surgical decompression in cases of nerve compression or entrapment. The spinal root of the accessory nerve is also critical to efficient respiration and regulation of voice pitch, as the nerve supplies the cricothyroid muscles. Therefore, when the spinal root of the accessory nerve is damaged, people can experience difficulty breathing, hoarseness, and fatigue due to inadequate expiration of the lungs. In summary, the spinal root of the accessory nerve originates from the primary motor neurons in the cervical spinal cord, and serves to innervate the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles of the neck, aiding in head and neck movement. Injury to the spinal root of the accessory nerve can lead to a condition known as spinal accessory neuropathy, which is characterized by weakness or paralysis of the neck and shoulder muscles. In addition, damage to the spinal root of the accessory nerve can also cause difficulty breathing, hoarseness, and fatigue.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 15859827}

Both names translate literally to 'Japanese stringed instrument.'According to Shintō myth as written in the Kojiki, the yamatogoto played an important role in the origins of Japan itself. In the myth, Amaterasu, goddess of the sun, is insulted by her brother Susano-o no Mikoto and hides in a cave, refusing to emerge. The world is therefore plunged into darkness. Amaterasu is eventually coaxed out of her cave by the goddess Ame-no-Uzume, who performs a dance outside the cave, to music provided by the twanging of six hunting bows. Amused by the music, and by the entertained sounds of the other gods, Amaterasu leaves the cave and returns to the firmament. The six bows are lashed together to form an instrument, and the first wagon or yamatogoto is born.The instrument's form has changed very little since the eighth century. Similar in shape to the more commonly known koto, the yamatogoto is narrower, as it has fewer strings. Bridges are made from the natural forks of tree branches, particularly maple trees, according to tradition. Unlike many instruments, the yamatogoto's strings are not arranged in a scale, from low to high pitch, but in a preset melodic sequence which is played in rhythmic patterns. Another common playing technique involves a quick glissando across all the strings, with all but the last string played immediately muted with the hand, thus allowing only the last string to resonate.Today, the instrument is used only in the Shintō ceremonial/court music called gagaku, and even then it is not common. Nevertheless, its central role in Japanese mythology allows it to retain some reverence.References Clark, Mitchell (2005). 'Sounds of the Silk Road: Musical Instruments of Asia.' Boston: Museum of Fine Arts Publications.Japanese musical instruments Zithers Kagura Sacred musical instruments Gagaku", "machine_text": " The Yamatogoto (山取) is a bowed string instrument from Japan dating back to around the 9th century CE. It is part of the classical tradition of Japanese instruments. The Yamatogoto is a 7-string instrument made of wood, with frets and a bridge similar to the Shamisen. It is often tuned in a major pentatonic tuning with perfect fourths between the strings. The Yamatogoto has a large resonator, resembling a half-moon shape on which the strings are strung. It is held between the legs when playing and the player plucks the strings with a bachi (plectrum). The Yamatogoto is used in a variety of musical contexts, from classical concerts to modern pop. It plays an important role in Japanese noh, a form of classical Japanese musical drama. Here, a Yamatogoto accompanies the actors and narrators as they perform their chants and songs. The instrument also plays a role in traditional and folk music, often accompanying chants, ceremonial music, and storytelling. It is also heard in gagaku, Japanese court music for ritualistic ceremonies. Gagaku is made up of ancient Asian traditions and modern Near Eastern influences, and the Yamatogoto is one of the instruments used to create this fusion of sound. Given its long history and associations with traditional culture, the Yamatogoto is sometimes used in accompaniment with shamisen and koto to depict an image of traditional Japan. In modern times it has been played by popular groups such as the Min'yo Connection, who give new life to traditional instrumentation. The Yamatogoto is a fascinating instrument, combining classical sounds with modern interpretations. Its use in a variety of musical styles and contexts makes it a fascinating instrument to explore and a vital component of the broader Japanese musical tradition.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2286630}

The Via Bona Award is given to those who serve as an example to others through their material and financial support, as well as their willingness to tread untried paths.The Via Bona Awards are nominated by Czech nonprofit organizations and are chosen by an independent jury.For the 19th year in a row, Via Foundation recognized individuals and companies who help improve their communities by giving their time, energy, expertise or money to help others. Via announced the winners of the 2016 Via Bona Philanthropy Awards. Juries selected winners in six categories.The 2016 award winners include people such as Zdeňka Mocňáková, who helps disabled people and senior citizens despite being bound to a wheelchair herself. She is the recipient of the Personal Engagement Award.In the Young Personal Engagement category, the jury selected two winners: Jakub Trefný, who despite being just nineteen years old, is an experienced volunteer nad helps senior citizens, homeless people and refugees, and Milan Dzuriak, who undertakes “Journeys against Pain” to raise money to make disabled children’s dreams come true.The Patron Award was presented to businessman Sanjiv Suri, owner of Zátiší Group, for his numerous philanthropic activities both in the Czech Republic and around the world.The Good Company Award went to Dušan Hopp’s company Auto Díly Servis s.r.o., based in Nový Jičín, whose owner and employees helped remodel a Home for Pregnant Women in Crisis.The Loyal Donor Award is a new category this year.

It is located on the Port Madison Indian Reservation in Washington state and was founded in 1983. The museum currently occupies a facility opened in 2012.History The Suquamish Museum opened in 1983 as the Suquamish Museum and Cultural Center, then only the second tribal museum in the state of Washington.In 2009 the Suquamish tribe launched a capital campaign to construct a new facility, enlisting Senator Patty Murray and former Washington Secretary of State Ralph Munro to help lead the effort. The new facility opened in 2012 and is triple the size of the original building. Constructed at a cost of 6 million, thepurpose-built structure is set in a small botanical garden on the Port Madison Indian Reservation and consists of two galleries, a gift shop, a 50-seat auditorium, and a climate-controlled storage room used to house artifacts not on display. The facility was designed by the Seattle architectural firm Mithun and is a LEED Gold certified building. In 2013 it received a citation from the Washington Council of the American Institute of Architects.OperationsCollectionIn addition to a large repository of photographs documenting tribal life from the 1860s to the present, the museum's collection includes 496 archaeological artifacts recovered from the site of the former Old Man House, a massive,long longhouse that served as the Suquamish capitol until its destruction in the late nineteenth century. Originally in the custody of the Burke Museum at the University of Washington, the artifacts, which include harpoon points, smoking pipes, and jewelry, were transferred to the Suquamish tribe in 2013.In 2014, the Port of Seattle transferred additional artifacts to the museum, including crockery and glass bottles, discovered during archaeological excavations in the 1970s at the Baba'kwob site, a pre-contact village located in what is now Seattle's Belltown neighborhood. The controversial transfer was contested by the Duwamish, an unrecognized tribe and historic Suquamish rival who claim ownership of the artifacts.Exhibitions The museum's main gallery features a permanent exhibit titled 'Ancient Shores – Changing Tides' that showcases drawings, documents, and historic photographs related to the Suquamish Tribe, contemporary and historic crafts, and interpretative panels and multimedia elements. The centerpiece of this exhibit is a 300-year-old carved canoe that was last used in the 1989 Paddle to Seattle, the first of a now annual series of canoe journeys through the Salish Sea undertaken by tribal members. A second gallery is used to house rotating exhibits from the museum's permanent collection, or items on loan from other museums, including traveling exhibits from the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service (SITES). Exhibits have included a SITES display 'Native Words, Native Warriors', chronicling the history of Native Americans in the U.S. armed forces.Management The Suquamish Museum is governed by a five-member board of directors appointed by the Suquamish Tribal Council. The galleries and auditorium of the museum are open daily during the summer, and five days per week the rest of the year. The museum's storage vault is open to tribal members and accredited researchers weekly.ReferencesEthnic museums in Washington (state) Coast Salish museums in Washington (state) Museums in Kitsap County, Washington Museums established in 1983 1983 establishments in Washington (state)", "machine_text": " The Suquamish Museum is a museum located in Suquamish, Washington.

The Military Public Affairs Enhancement and Employment Concept (MPAEEC) set out the reasons for change and vision for the Branch, explaining that the current construct 'lacks the proper readiness to effectively support overseas operations', and noted five deficiencies of the public affairs function and officers within: insufficient military culture, expertise and readiness; reactive, rather than strategic-driven engagement; ineffectual management of visual communications; lack of innovation; and insufficient [Canadian Armed Forces] capacity and mindsets.The situation was described as a consequence of structural changes over time within the Assistant Deputy Minister Public Affairs organization that put emphasis on civilian rather than military practitioners, and 'led to a dilution of military culture and a lack of focus on martial imperatives. In recent years it has been difficult to distinguish the difference in roles between the civilian and CAF communications, leading to a corporate mindset among some [Public Affairs Officers] and Image Techs.' The initiative was stood down in December 2020 by the Chief of the Defence Staff General Jonathan Vance, and its personnel re-assigned. In June 2021, then then-acting Chief of the Defence Staff General Wayne Eyre and Deputy Minister Jody Thomas, determined that 'the effort to expand the formal range of duties of Public Affairs Officers into the [Information Operations/Influence Activity] domain, including the draft [MPAEEC] paper, were incompatible with Government of Canada Communications Policy, and the DND/CAF vision, mission and principles of Public Affairs.'Order of precedenceExternal links Canadian Forces Recruiting Canadian Forces and Department of National DefenceReferencesCanadian Armed Forces personnel branches", "machine_text": " Public Affairs Branch (Canadian Forces) is a Canadian Armed Forces organization within the Department of National Defence that is dedicated to communicating the activities and achievements of the CAF to the general public.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Mikel Laboa\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Mikel Laboa Mancisidor (15 June 1934 – 1 December 2008) was one of the Basque Country's most important singer-songwriters.Considered the patriarch of Basque music, his music has had an influence on younger generations. A testament to this is the tribute album Txerokee, Mikel Laboaren Kantak ('Cherokee: Songs of Mikel Laboa'), published in 1991 by various younger-generation rock and folk music groups. His album Bat-Hiru ('One-Three') was chosen in a reader poll by the local Diario Vasco newspaper as the greatest Basque album in history. Nearly all of his songs are sung in Basque.Biography Mikel Laboa was born 15 June 1934 in Pasaia, Gipuzkoa.He spent nearly two years of his childhood in the town of Lekeitio, Bizkaia. In the 1950s he studied medicine and psychiatry in Pamplona-Iruña. He would constantly balance his artistic career with his medical career, which began at the Children's Neuropsychiatry unit at Patronato San Miguel in San Sebastián, where he worked for almost 20 years.During his student years he became interested in music, influenced by artists such as Atahualpa Yupanqui and Violeta Parra. Following in their footsteps, Laboa would likewise identify himself as a 'political artist.' In 1958 he made his debut at the Teatro Gayarre in Pamplona.During the 1960s he, along with other Basque artists including singer Lourdes Iriondo, Xabier Lete and Benito Lertxundi, founded the cultural group Ez Dok Amairu ('There is no 13'), which in many ways sought to revitalize Basque culture, long dormant under the Francoist regime. They dedicated their focus on the revival and social status of the Basque language. Within this group Laboa came into his own, emerging along with Benito Lertxundi as a prime example of what was called 'new Basque music.'Laboa's music can be described as a combination of tradition, poetry and experimentalism, in the songwriting style of the 1960s and 1970s, but endowed with a strong personal touch and a unique voice. His work combines old standards reinterpreted in modern style, lyrical poetry from authors such as Bertolt Brecht, and suitable compositions. Deserving special mention are his Lekeitioak, experimental songs based on shouts and onomatopoetic sounds.Laboa was a creative force for 35 years, continuing well into his old age until his fragile health kept him away from the stage. He would collaborate often with jazz musician Iñaki Salvador and worked with the Orfeón Donostiarra and other orchestral groups from the Basque Country. Some of his most well-known songs are featured in La pelota vasca ('The Basque ball'), a documentary by Julio Medem. On 11 July 2006 he gave his final performance, opening for Bob Dylan at a 'Concert for Peace' held in the city of Donostia-San Sebastián.A curious feature of his album titles is the fact that they are numeric. This custom began in 1974 with the release of his two-disc Bat-Hiru (1–3). The album 2, with songs based on the writings of Brecht, had been banned by Francoist censorship. This was followed by the double LP Lau-Bost (4–5) and 6. His Lekeitios comprised albums 7 through 11, although only a compilation of these was released through low-key marketing. These were followed by 12, and Laboa skipped number 13 in homage to the group Ez Dok Amairu, whose name means 'There's no 13' in Basque. Afterwards, he released 14, and his live albums 15 and 16. Not including compilations, his most recent release was 17 (Xoriek).His final collaboration was with the Pasaia group Naizroxa, where he contributed to the first and only song on the first disc, 'Iqharaturic.'Mikel Laboa died 1 December 2008 at a hospital in Donostia-San Sebastián at the age of 74.DiscographyLau herri kanta, 1964Ursuako Kantak, 1966Bertold Brecht, 1969Haika Mutil, 1969Euskal Kanta Berria, 1972Bat-Hiru, 1974Lau-bost, 19806 (Sei), 1985Lekeitioak, 198812 (Hamabi), 198914 (Hamalau), 1994Mikel Laboa Zuzenean, 1997Zuzenean II – Gernika, 200060ak+2, 2003Xoriek – 17, 2005ReferencesExternal linksMikel Laboa.

He was a key figure of Basque music during his lifetime, and was a pioneer of rock and roll in the region. Laboa began his career as a musician in the 1950s, playing gigs in the cities of the Basque Region while he studied Industrial Engineering at the University of Sarriko in Bilbao. He soon dropped out of college to focus entirely on music and songwriting. After settling in Paris in the mid-1950s, he started making LPs and gaining a regional following. His first recording was the album “Canciones Populares Vascas” in 1960. Laboa’s music made frequent use of Basque folk instruments such as the txistu, alboka, trikitixa and txalaparta and drew from a wide range of influences, from traditional Basque folk to jazz, rock, pop and classical music. He contributed significantly to spreading Basque music culture and language throughout the Basque Country, by introducing less traditional lyrical conventions to the traditional Basque music genre, and he often performed in Basque festivals. Laboa made many appearances on television and radio programs, both national and international. He won numerous awards, such as nine Premio Ondas awards, the Europeo Musa Award and the Medal of la Ciudad de Donostia-San Sebastián, among others. He also collaborated with some of the most prominent figures of Basque music, such as Autonomo and Fermin Murga. Despite the success of his recordings, Laboa's live performances were where most of his fans got to experience his music and admire his stage presence. Laboa was known for ending his concerts with the obligatory request for fans to join in a round of applause, to which he sang 'Eskerrik asko, eskerrik asko, gaude eta comunicate' ('Thank you, thank you, rejoice and communicate). Laboa passed away in 2008 at the age of 74 due to cancer. As a tribute, the Basque Government dedicated a museum to his life and work, the Museo Mikel Laboa, which opened in 2009 in the small village of Urdax in the Navarre Province.

India recognized Cambodia's independence from France in 1953 and established diplomatic relations in the same year. India has provided small-scale economic and military assistance to Cambodia, while economic relations between the two countries are minimal. India was one of the first countries to set up a diplomatic mission in Cambodia during the post-independence period. The then Minister, Pran Nath Thapar, opened the India-Cambodia diplomatic mission in 1954. This diplomatic mission was an expression of India's trust, friendship and cooperation with the newly independent Cambodian nation. The then Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru and Chief of State Norodom Sihanouk made exchanges during 'Festival of India' held in the year 1959 in Phnom Penh. India is considered a major supporter and friend of Cambodia in the international arena. It supported the inclusion of Cambodia in ASEAN and was also a major participant in the United Nations Transitional Authority for Cambodia (UNTAC) which administered the 1993 elections in Cambodia. India is currently the second largest provider of financial assistance to Cambodia since the formation of the government in 1993. It has contributed US3 million since 1993 and a further US 4 million in 2010 for Cambodia's development projects. The Government of India is also actively promoting investment by Indian companies in Cambodia. India increased its aid to Cambodia as a gesture of friendship and goodwill to focus on education, health and agricultural sectors. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) has also been signed between India and Cambodia. India also provides assistance in capacity building in the fields of agriculture, rural development, IT and communications.

Rosemont College also includes the Schools of Graduate and Professional Studies offering degrees and certificates at the master's level.One of the oldest Catholic women's colleges in the region, Rosemont originally 'had a reputation for educating the daughters of more well-to-do Catholics.'Rosemont's first chairman of the board was Cardinal Dougherty, who was instrumental in gaining Rosemont its first accreditation from the Middle States Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools by personally guaranteeing the college's financial solvency.Bishop Fulton J. Sheen was likewise involved in the early life of the college, describing Rosemont as 'the finest girls' college in the United States.'During World War II, Rosemont students aided the war effort by selling war bonds serving as air-raid wardens while the college hosted Villanova College's summer programs as Villanova's campus was in use during the summers by the United States Navy.However, Rosemont evolved over the course of the twentieth century; 'As views on women changed, the original—what some would call convent—atmosphere gradually moved toward more freedom for students to come and go, later curfews, and greater interaction with college men.'In 1963, Rosemont students insisted that the college begin bringing non-Catholic speakers to campus, and by the early 1970s, the college ceased holding religious retreats due to lack of attendance.CampusIn 1927, the Sisters of the Holy Child of Jesus acquired the former home of Joseph F. Sinnott, known both as Rathalla and as the Joseph Sinnott Mansion for 1.00 to serve as the school campus.The English origins of the Sisters of the Holy Child influenced the campus architecture and layout.

His works were popular among Restoration theatre audiences and were frequently performed in Drury Lane and the Theatre Royal. Cleaver was born in the late 1650s in either Northumberland or Northamptonshire in England. Very little is known about his early life and upbringing, suggesting that he was either born into a family of modest means or that he was orphaned at a young age. Regardless, he found his way to London by the 1670s, where he began to pursue a career in the theatre. At some point in the early 1670s, Cleaver was invited to join the United Company, a group of prominent playwrights, actors and theatre professionals who ran numerous theatre franchises during the late 1660s and early 1670s. Some of his most famous works were completed while he was a member of the company, including The Governor (1677) and The Sea Voyage (1678). In addition to writing, Cleaver was also a prolific performer. He appeared in productions by John Dryden and William Wycherley, among others. He also had some success on the stage as a monologist and was frequently seen in comedy roles. He was especially known for his roles as loquacious roguish characters. Cleaver was one of the most active publishers and booksellers in London during the latter half of the seventeenth century. He published a number of his own plays and manuscripts, as well as many works by other authors. He managed the printing and distribution of works from some of the most distinguished playwrights of the day, including John Dryden and George Farquhar. Cleaver's other business interests included acting as agent for foreign plays as well as serving as publisher of the Beggar's Opera from 1728-1737. He frequently procured manuscripts from abroad, most notably from France and Italy, and wrote letters introducing them to the English booksellers. Cleaver died in 1743 in London. Despite his success as a dramatist, publisher, and actor during the Restoration era, he is noted today as among the less remembered of English playwrights. Nevertheless, his work during the Restoration period contributed to the development of the English stage in lasting ways.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 17921931}

The editors of The Handbook of British Chronology have placed his date of accession between 879 and 889 and his death between 890 and 896 with a terminal end date of 900. This date is confirmed by the fact that Asser, Wulfsige's successor, was signing charters as bishop of Sherborne in 900. However, it has recently been suggested that Wulfsige of Sherborne might have been the same Wulfsige who succeeded Heahstan as bishop of London around 900, making 900 the approximate year of Wulfsige's transfer rather than his death.Educational reform under Alfred the Great Wulfsige was a contemporary of King Alfred the Great, who had undertaken an effort of educational reform in his realm, personally translating into English what he considered the works “most necessary for all men to know.” When Alfred translated the Pastorale of Pope Gregory the Great, he sent a copy to each of his bishops, including Wulfsige, and added a prefatory letter explaining his educational aims and requesting the bishops to educate young men so that they could read these great works, originally composed in Latin. The copy sent to Wulfsige, which includes his name in the preface, survives as MS Ii.2.4 at Cambridge University Library. It is one of only five which are extant today and was the original from which copies were made in the eleventh century.When Werferth, bishop of Worcester, translated Gregory's Dialogues into English, Alfred sent an exemplar to Wulfsige, who composed a poem that was included as a preface to the work. In this preface, Wulfsige asked his readers to pray for him and for King Alfred, whom he referred to as the 'greatest treasure-giver of all time.'CitationsReferencesExternal linksBishops of Sherborne (ancient) 9th-century English bishops", "machine_text": " Wulfsige of Sherborne was an Anglo-Saxon Bishop based in the area of Sherborne, England. He was active during the early part of the 10th century, and is best known for being the first Bishop of Sherborne. Little is known about Wulfsige's life before he was consecrated as bishop at the royal court of King Athelstan. He is said to have been a royal chaplain prior to becoming a bishop. It is likely that Wulfsige was born in the kingdom of Wessex, as he subscribed acts of King Athelstan and King Edmund in the region. As bishop, Wulfsige founded the Cathedral of Sherborne in 909. He also established a monastic community in the area, built a palace and introduced a new system of laws and regulations to govern the area. Under Wulfsige's rule, Sherborne grew to become one of the most important centers of Christianity in Anglo-Saxon England. He was known to have maintained close ties with the Archbishop of Canterbury, and was a supporter of the Carolingian dynasty. He was also a close advisor to King Athelstan, and is believed to have been instrumental in the king's decisions during his reign. By 920, Wulfsige had retired as Bishop of Sherborne, due to ill health. He died soon after and was buried in the area in a tomb that he himself had constructed. He was succeeded by fellow bishop Æthelnoth, who continued his works in Sherborne. Wulfsige of Sherborne is largely known for his establishment of the Cathedral of Sherborne, which is still standing today. His work greatly contributed to the growth of Christianity in the area and helped to shape the later leading role played by Sherborne in English Christian history.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 13112783}

It stars Sudhakar, Raadhika, Vijayan and Rati. The film was released on 31 August 1979.PlotSudhakar is a poor man desperately looking for work. One day he has a skirmish with Radhika, a rich woman and only daughter of a businessman Selladurai, in a telephone booth. Radhika finds out that Sudhakar is searching for a job from his diary that he leaves at the booth. She employs him in her father's firm as a manager and soon they mutually fall in love. Radhika's class-conscious father initially opposes but later reluctantly agrees to have them married. However things take a turn when his business friend Sivaraman, to whom he owes a lot of favours, visits him and reminds him of his old promise to get Radhika married to Sivaraman's son Vijayan. And soon after Sudhakar goes missing with five lakhs of the office cash on his way to Bombay and is presumed to have absconded. Radhika is heart-broken and her father takes her to Sivaraman's estate in Ooty to relax for a while.In Ooty, Radhika and her father are introduced to Vijayan who shockingly seems to be a severely despondent alcoholic. He is often seen standing near the shore of the river listening to his tape recorder playing a lone melodious song, sung by a woman. After a few days in the estate and several interactions, Vijayan andRadhika get acquainted and friendly with each other and he opens up about his erstwhile lover Rathi. Vijayan had fallen in love with the beautiful Rathi at first sight and pursues her relentlessly till she finally reciprocates. Rathi often playfully cheats Vijayan about not knowing stuff like horse riding and car driving when she actually could. And on an April Fool's Day when she claims she doesn't know how to swim, Vijayan thinks she's fooling him again and playfully pushes her into the river but to his horror she drowns and dies. The incident left Vijayan as a suicidal wreck who carries poison in his coat but doesn't consume it just for his father's sake. Rather he has chosen the slow poison of alcohol. When Vijayan learns Radhika too has a past forlorn love affair, he feels closer to her since they both seem to be in the same boat.As days move on, Vijayan and Radhika get closer to each other and eventually agree to get married, much to the delight of their fathers but then on an eventful day Radhika encounters Sudhakar working as a gardener in the estate. Radhika angrily admonishes him for having deserted her and walks away but Vijayan is determined to find out the truth. It turns out that Sudhakar was coerced and forced to decamp by Radhika's father himself so he could get her married to Vijayan.On the day of their supposed marriage, Vijayan gets Radhika united with Sudhakar and they leave town together. Later, Vijayan who had promised to Radhika to give up alcohol, instead consumes the poison he carried in his pocket and walks into the river that had once consumed his beloved Rathi. Before dying Vijayan makes a statement to God, 'They say love is blind, but You have been blind to my love, so I am leaving my glasses for You'.CastSudhakar as Sudhakar Raadhika as Radhika Vijayan as Vijayan Rati as Rathi Vagai ChandrasekharProductionAfter Panchu Arunachalam wrote the screenplay for the film that would become Niram Maratha Pookal, Bharathiraja approached K.

Bharathiraja initially wanted Rajinikanth, Kamal Haasan and Sridevi to portray the characters Vijayan, Sudhakar and Rati; the producer who initially was supposed to produce died, so Sudhakar, Raadhika, Vijayan and Rati Agnihotri were instead cast as the lead characters, with their characters being named after themselves.

It was primarily produced by A.R. Kannan who has worked in multiple hit films in the Tamil film industry. The series is set in fictional town in the Pudukkottai district of Tamil Nadu, India and revolves around the individual and collective struggles of a small Maratha family as they attempt to find their place in life. The series starts with the character of Ramanathan (played by R. Pirabaharan), an ambitious middle class Maratha man from Pudukkottai district who dreams of a better future for himself, his wife Janaki (played by Uma Padmanabhan), and their three children. While Ramanathan and his wife both work as food vendors in a nearby village, his children are unable to attend school. The family suffers from problems such as unequal access to resources, health issues, and other struggles that many families from rural areas face in India. The story then follows Ramanathan and his efforts to provide the best opportunities for his children, using whatever little resources he can gather in the small village. He takes up loans to pay for the educational fees of his children, works hard to make a living, and encourages his children to make the most of the opportunities that come their way in life. He also takes initiatives to provide awareness in the village about modern education and healthcare provisions. At the same time, a romantic subplot develops between the eldest of Ramanathan's children, Rooban (played by Jeevan Kumar), and Janaki's sister's daughter, Geetha (played by Pavina Feroz). As Rooban and Geetha come closer, Ramanathan finds himself in the midst of a complicated web of various emotions. The series's title refers to this unique bond between the two characters and the many flowers of feelings that arise from it. Niram Maratha Pookal is an example of the changing landscape of contemporary Tamil drama series. Despite being set in a rural area, the series attempts to bridge the gap between the rural and the urban, portraying both the struggles and the achievements of a small Maratha family. It also speaks volumes of the compassion that exists in rural areas and how small villages can come together to help its people. As the series has progressed, it slowly delves into larger social issues, as seen in the second season, which has dealt with topics such as the education gap, medical expenses, and poverty. The series has earned critical acclaim for its writing and direction, with critics calling it 'deeply engaging and entertaining' and 'a show for the ages'. It has been particularly praised for its depiction of the emotional struggles of rural life and its exploration of its characters. It has also been commended for its accurate portray of local Tamil words and customs, making it unique and true to its setting. The series has achieved widespread popularity in its native Tamil region as is widely watched by people both in urban and rural areas.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 34155547}

Later, in 2004, the OCC (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency) authorized its preemption rule which declared that a national bank's ability to exert its incidental powers which include lending and deposit taking inhibited state laws that obstruct, impair or condition” the business of banking.'BackgroundUnder the National Bank Act, there is a dual banking system in the United States: a federal system based on national bank charters, and a state system formed on state charters. Under the act, a national bank association has the power to do what is necessary for its banking business.In 1994, amongst a time of national bank expansion across state lines, Congress clearly declared its aim to create a path of freedom from state regulations by adopting the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (Riegle-Neal). This act sought a new preemption standard for national banks in America by administering that national banks were subject to state consumer laws as if they were sections of a state bank except when federal law preempted the application of a state law to a national bank or if the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (OCC) concluded that a state law inclined against national banks. Courts later held that the (Riegle-Neal) act gave the OCC the ability to apply state laws even if they were not prohibited.A Florida law prohibited Florida-licensed insurance agents from engaging in certain insurance activities such as deposits and engage in any activity incidental to receiving deposits where the agent was related with, among other things, any bank than one which was not a subordinate or associate of a bank capital company, and was located in a city with a populace of less than 5000 people.

The facts of the case: Debra and Terrance Nelson entered into a contract with a housing developer to purchase a home in Marion County, Fla.

Barnett Bank agreed to provide the loan with the Nelsons as co-signers.

Barnett Bank then moved to foreclose on the property, citing the loan contract as the legal basis for their action. The Nelsons filed a lawsuit against Barnett Bank, arguing that the loan had been unfairly discriminatory and should be voided. The court disagreed with the Nelsons' argument and found in favor of Barnett Bank. The court found that the loan contract between the Nelsons and Barnett Bank was legal and enforceable, and that Barnett Bank had the right to foreclose on the property. The court concluded that the Nelsons had failed to meet their burden of proof in showing that the loan was unfairly discriminatory. Thus, the court upheld Barnett Bank’s right to foreclose on the property and affirmed the contractual loan agreement between the Nelsons and Barnett Bank. Barnett Bank of Marion County, N.A. v.

It was in Kirkcaldy that 'Wispy', as Wallace was nicknamed, developed his reputation as a top-class goal poacher, his skills being rewarded with a first Scottish League cap.Hearts Wallace's form attracted attention from larger clubs, Heart of Midlothian eventually spending £15,000 to take him to Edinburgh in April 1961. The increased pressure for success at Tynecastle initially curtailed his scoring exploits, for he was expected to replace no less a figure than Alex Young, the 'Golden Vision', whom Hearts had sold to Everton a couple of months earlier. By season 1962–63, however, Wallace was fully settled into the tactics of manager Tommy Walker, and he would become Hearts' top scorer for the next four seasons through to 1965–66. In doing so, he helped Hearts win the Scottish League Cup in 1962 and come within a goal of winning the 1964–65 Scottish Football League title, while gaining full international recognition for Scotland.In 1966, however, his form plummeted and his goalscoring ceased and, amid rumours that he had been 'tapped' up by another club, his departure from Tynecastle was widely anticipated. The surprise was that his destination wasn't boyhood favourites Rangers but their nemesis Celtic, for whom Jock Stein paid £30,000 to secure his services. He played a total of 248 matches for Hearts in all competitions, scoring 131 goals.Celtic Within six months of joining Celtic, Wallace was to attain Scottish footballing immortality, as one of the 'Lisbon Lions', the famous team who won the European Cup in 1967.

In total, he scored 140 goals for Celtic in 239 games.Later career After five fruitful years with Celtic, Wallace and team-mate John Hughes were sold to Crystal Palace in October 1971 for a combined fee of £30,000. Neither enjoyed great success in Croydon and Wallace was back in Scotland with Dumbarton less than a year later. As his career wound down, he moved to Australia in March 1975 to play for APIA, where he won two league titles before returning to Scotland in March 1977, first to Partick Thistle for a week, before becoming player-coach at Ross County for the rest of the 1976–77 season.International career In total, Wallace was capped seven times for Scotland and four times for the Scottish Football League XI. He was part of the Scotland team that defeated England at Wembley in 1967.Career after retirement Retiring as a player in June 1977, he joined the coaching staff at Dundee.

Future medicine is a rapidly emerging field and its application has the potential to revolutionize healthcare in the 21st century. The use of this advanced technology will enable healthcare providers to diagnose and treat patients more quickly and accurately by providing highly precise information about the individual patient. By integrating data from a variety of sources and using advanced algorithms, AI and machine learning, doctors will be able to make personalized treatments based on individual medical histories, symptoms, and genomes. This data-driven approach will help to reduce errors and enable doctors to more quickly and effectively create personalized treatments that address the individual patient’s needs. In addition to improving diagnoses and treatment plans, future medicine will also be applied to the prevention of disease. By analyzing individual health data, doctors will be able to recognize patterns and early signs of potential illnesses that may be developing. This will enable them to better advise their patients on the preventive measures they can take to reduce or eliminate the risk of developing certain illnesses. Furthermore, sophisticated forms of telemedicine will be available, allowing patients to receive medical advice, diagnosis, and treatment without ever leaving their homes.

Furthermore, predictive analytics and machine learning will be used to identify problem areas earlier, making it possible for treatments to be delivered more quickly and efficiently, resulting in better outcomes and fewer costs. Overall, future medicine holds tremendous potential to revolutionize healthcare and make healthcare delivery more precise and cost-effective. By applying cutting-edge technology, healthcare providers will be able to provide more accurate diagnoses and treatments that are tailored to the individual patient, resulting in improved results and outcomes. Additionally, this will lead to earlier detection of illnesses and more cost-effective treatments, leading to greater savings for patients and healthcare systems.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 51197134}

He was born to Charles Cavendish, 2nd Baron Waterpark, and Sarah Bosville, daughter of Robert and Frances Bosville, on 13 March 1777 in London, England. Throughout his lifetime, Henry Cavendish was widely regarded as a highly accomplished gentleman. He was well-educated in mathematics, astronomy, and physics, and was known to host gatherings of local scientists at Waterpark House, his estate in Hampshire. His cousin, Sir Charles Cavendish, was a politician and president of the Royal Society. Cavendish inherited the title of the 3rd Baron Waterpark after his father's death in 1802. Prior to this, his father had been toiling for years to build a family fortune, which was a considerable inheritance for his son. Cavendish was a wealthy man, and he used this money to support his interest in scientific studies and exploration. In 1810, Cavendish was elected as a founder of the Royal Society of London, becoming a Fellow of that organization in 1813. His role was instrumental in advancing its research agenda into the realm of mechanics and astrophysics. In addition to the Royal Society, he was also a longtime member of the Royal Astronomical Society, the Royal Academy of Arts, and the Linnean Society. Cavendish was a generous patron of the sciences, providing support to a number of colleges and universities as well as founding several prizes and scholarships. He was also a steady supporter of esteemed naturalist Alexander von Humboldt, and sponsored his research expeditions to South America in the early 19th century. On top of his patronage of science, Cavendish was actively involved in agricultures. Through his leadership on the National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Breeches, he developed conservation methods for farming and watershed management, allowing for improved farming and better protection of local ecosystems. Cavendish passed away on 30 April 1836 in Hampshire. Though he left no direct heirs, he left behind a lasting legacy in the field of science and conservation. His achievements in scientific study, natural history, and agriculture are still celebrated today by many institutions and organizations.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 14107759}

The cuts of meat are arranged in the pot of water and cooked until the desired level of tenderness is achieved. Palasip Qaqqaa is typically served with special homemade bread called 'Qajaq' and often accompanied by a variety of jams and fruit. The dish has been an important part of Inuit culture and tradition for centuries, and served, at times, as an important source of sustenance and nutrition in difficult years of food scarcity, when game and fish were scarce. Today, Palasip Qaqqaa is an integral part of many travel experiences in the Arctic, where hunters, fishermen and travelers often enjoy the dish when crossing the region. Many Inuit families still serve the dish for special occasions, usually for weddings and holidays. Furthermore, the dish is served in many restaurants across Canada and Alaska and provides a great opportunity for experiencing authentic Inuit cuisine. Due to its versatile nature and rich history, Palasip Qaqqaa is often used as an example of food sharing and traditional Inuit hospitality. It serves as a reminder of the hospitality and resilience of the Inuit people, who have managed to survive and thrive despite difficult environmental conditions and scarce resources.

Born in Ankara, Turkey to English navy officers, Hipwood received his early education at home. His French fluency at a young age earned him the nickname 'Jimmy the Greek'. He had a lifelong interest in science and mathematics and graduated from Imperial College London in 1933 with a degree in physics. After a postgraduate year at the University of Cambridge, he joined the British Admiralty in 1934, working as a physicist on the development of radar. Hipwood's skills in cryptography were noticed by the admiralty and he was asked to help design machine cryptography systems during World War II, as well as helping to develop improved encryption techniques and deciphering codes. He was involved in a number of secret operations during the war, including the breaking of the Japanese codes in the lead-up to the Battle of Midway. He was responsible for the design and implementation of the ciphering machine known as Typex, which was used by the Royal Navy during the war. After World War II Hipwood joined the newly formed Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) where he further developed his expertise in communications intelligence. He was made head of GCHQ's cryptography section in 1951 and remained with the organization until his retirement in 1973, during which time he continued work on code-breaking, secure telecommunications and satellite communication systems.

The Appellant alleged that the Respondent had engaged in fraudulent and unfair trading practices, and that the damages amounted to over HK20million. The Appellant was the director and shareholder of a group of companies located in Hong Kong which were incorporated in 2016. The businesses of the companies included property development, project marketing, trading of precious metal and currency, and other related activities. In August 2018, the Appellant entered into a consulting agreement with the Respondent which allowed the Respondent to have exclusive access to their information. However, the Appellant claimed that the Respondent used its access to their confidential documents for their own business gain, and not for the benefit of the Appellant. The Appellant argued that the Respondent had diverted business opportunities away from the Appellant’s companies to gain an unfair advantage. The Appellant claimed that through the use of their confidential information, the Respondent was able to secure lucrative business contracts with other parties. The Respondent, on the other hand, maintained that the consulting agreement was not the cause of the alleged losses, but that it was due to the Appellant’s lack of business acumen. The Respondent also claimed that at no time did they misuse their access to the Appellant’s confidential documents.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Cumulative inequality theory\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Cumulative inequality theory or Cumulative Disadvantage Theory is the systematic explanation of how inequalities develop. The theory was initially developed by Merton (1988), who studied the sciences and prestige. He believed that recognition from peers, and from published research in the scientific field created cumulative advantage (see Matthew affectMatthew effect)that led to the receipt of resources that facilitated research projects. The theory expanded in four decades to include the idea that some people have more disadvantages than advantages which influence the quality of life of societies, cohorts, and individuals.The theory is principally a social scientific explanation of phenomena but with links to biological and health factors, personal adjustment, and well-being.A central premise is that “social systems generate inequality, which is manifested over the life course via demographic and developmental processes.”Development and applicationThe ideas of this theory were developed by Kenneth Ferraro and colleagues as an integrative or middle-range theory.Originally specified in five axioms and nineteen propositions, cumulative inequality theory incorporates elements from the following theories and perspectives, several of which are related to the study of society: Robert Merton articulated the Matthew effect to explain accumulating advantageGlen Elder’s life course perspectiveStress process theoryAge stratification theory.In recent years, Ferraro and several other researchers have been testing and elaborating elements of the theory on a variety of topics to provide evidence for the theoretical framework. In the following information you will find some of the uses of this theory in sociological studies.McDonough, Worts, Booker, et al (2015) for example studied cumulative disadvantage in the generations of health inequality among mothers in Britain and the United States.The study examined“if adverse circumstances early in the life course cumulate as health harming biographical patterns across working and family caregiving years.”Also, it was examined if institutional context moderated cumulative effects of micro level processes. The results showed that existing health disparities of women in midlife, during work and family rearing time, were intensified by cumulative disadvantages caused by adversities in early life. Thus, the accumulation of disadvantage had negative connotations for the well-being of women's occupational experiences and family life.McLean (2010), on the other hand, studied U.S combat and non combat veterans through cumulative disadvantage. He discovered that cumulated negative disadvantages caused by disability and unemployment were more likely to influence the lives of combat veterans versus non combat veterans. Combat veterans suffered physical and emotional trauma that had a disabling effect which impeded their ability to successfully obtain employment. . The research is crucial for social policy implementation that assist United States Veterans to find and retain employment that is suitable to their personal conditions.In continuation, Woolredge, Frank, Coulette, et al. ( 2016) studied the prison sentencing of racial groups. specifically of African American males with prior felony convictions. They examined how pre-trial processes affect trial outcomes. It was determined that cumulative disadvantage was existent for African American males and young men; the results were measured by: set bail amounts, pre-trial detention, prison sentencing, and no reduction in sentencing length. The research are striving to create changes in the justice system that reduce incarceration rates of African American Males by reducing bail amounts, and pre trial imprisonment. Further studies are important to decrease the incarceration of minority groups in society, and to create a non biased justice system.Additionally, FerraroMoore (2003) have applied the theory to the study of long-term consequences of early obesity for midlife health and socioeconomic attainment. The study shows that obesity experienced in early life leads to lower-body disability, but higher risk factors to health. Moreover. The research mentions a risk that has been brought to attention in the past years; it ties being over weight to negative stigma (DeJong 1980),and has influenced fair labor market positioning and wages.Lastly, Crystal, Shea,Reyes (2016) studied the effects of cumulative advantage in increasing within age cohort economic inequalities in diverse periods of time. The study utilized economic patterns such as annual wealth value and household size. The inequalities of age were analyzed by using the gini coefficient.The study took place between 1980 and 2010. The results showed that at age 65 plus individuals had higher rates of inequality and it increased significantly for baby boomers or during economic recession and times of war. The research is written to estimate the possible impacts of social security changes on older adults in American Society.In conclusion, Cumulative Inequality or Cumulative Disadvantage Theory, is broadly examining various topics that impact public policy, and the view of our role within society. Further benefits of the theory are still to be seen in the next coming years.Core ideasAccording to Ferraro and Shippee, there are five main ideas in cumulative inequality or Cumulative Disadvantage Theory, which include:“Axiom 1: Social systems generate inequality, which is manifested over the life course through demographic and developmental processes. Axiom 2:Disadvantage increases exposure to risk, but advantage increases exposure to opportunity. Axiom 3: Life course trajectories are shaped by the accumulation of risk, available resources, and human agency. Axiom 4:The perception of life trajectories influences subsequent trajectories Axiom 5:Cumulative inequality may lead to premature mortality; therefore, nonrandom selection may give the appearance of decreasing inequality in later life.”Axiom 1Ferraro, K.F.,Shippee, T.P. (2009) stated that social structures shape human behavior and interpersonal relations. Furthermore, cumulation in childhood experiences shape life outcomes sometimes in negative ways.Inequality is, therefore,not a randomly determined misfortune, but rather a predestined state that one is born into. Although it is possible for inequality to come from an individual's own actions consequences, that is not always true. One's childhood experiences and conditions should also be taken into consideration since these experiences help mold a young individual into an adult.Axiom 2Ferraro, K.F.,Shippee, T.P. (2009) want us to consider that cumulative advantage and disadvantage are not different they are merely opposite ends of the spectrum. Cumulative Disadvantage is perceived as a risk whereas Cumulative Advantage is an opportunity.A well-known concept in sociological sources is that individuals with advantages, whether they are achieved or born into, have a higher rate of opportunity in life. On the contrary, those with many disadvantages are more susceptible to risks throughout their life. For example, one who is born into the majority race with well-educated parents in a developed area will have more exposure to opportunity, whether it be getting a job through one of their parents' college friends or going to a highly rated high school and then being able to get into a highly accredited college. But, on the contrary, one who is born into a minority race with parents who may not have finished high school and live in the ghettos of the roughest town in the city may, not only have less exposure to opportunities, but more exposure to risks such as violence and crime.Axiom 3Ferraro, K.F.,Shippee, T.P. (2009) state that even though previous life events are important, the overall quality of life is determined by frequently changing trajectories, or the long-term changes in life stability, which are created by an individual's resources, risks, and human agencies. Human agencies simply refer to an individual's own ability to act and think on their own based on their own morals and beliefs. ElderShanahan (2006) however, believe that people's responses to stimuli determines changes to the trajectory of life. Moreover, the involvement of the institution in the decision-making process also alters individual decisions and behaviors.Axiom 4Carstensen (2006) makes the inference that ones view on everyday situations andsuccess outcomes is more influential than their actual life status when it comes to their subsequent actions. Drawing from social comparison and symbolic interaction theories, a person's view of their resources may be different from what actually exists, and therefore shapes life trajectories in unique ways. People's view of their lives play a huge role into how they continue their trajectory through the decisions they make, and the activities they choose to partake in. Therefore, the theory makes the claim that those who possess a more positive and optimistic outlook on life typically are more satisfied with their life course.Axiom 5Ferraro, K.F.,Shippee, T.P. (2009) stated that before starting to explain Axiom 5, researchers should avoid cohort inversion. It will limit cohort centered studies, specifically, as it refers to the use of non random sample selection that excludes individuals with greater health issues from the samples. Studying individuals of certain age in this case, older adults, may lead to skewed data if selection of only healthier older adults takes place. The mean concentration of results will be designed to a specific population which will limit the data from being externally valid. The axiom may seem hard to understand at first but the overall meaning is that the accumulation of disadvantages can lead to premature mortality, or in simpler terms, younger death. Also, nonrandom selection may make it seem like mortality rates are decreasing when they are not. Take for example the number of young people deaths in areas with high crime and violence. These individuals are not exposed to many advancing opportunities so they fall victim of the cumulative inequality theory. The nonrandom selection component of the axiom signifies how older populations age in a manner that is not totally random, but rather as a result of the advantages and disadvantages that they have gathered throughout their life. An example is exceptional health care throughout life which prolonged lifespan, or, on the contrary, prolonged exposure to toxic chemicals as a result of working in dangerous environments.SourcesFurther readingSocial theories", "machine_text": " Cumulative inequality theory (CIT) is a set of interrelated theories which claim that persistent inequalities within societies are generated, maintained and reproduced across generations of individuals. CIT encompasses theories in the fields of sociology, psychology, economics, and other disciplines. Proponents of CIT contend that certain economically, socially, or politically favored individuals, families, or groups tend to remain advantaged in comparison to those who are less privileged; and these relative privileges, in turn, determine their children's subsequent opportunities. Consequently, accumulated advantages and disadvantages over time create an intergenerational social hierarchy and perpetuates the disparity among different generations. According to CIT, current inequalities cannot be seen as solely the result of past resources and assets following a naive crystallization theory (e.g, as proposed by Functionalist theory). Rather, inequality and stratification perpetuate, and possibly increase, through the process of social closure. Social closure refers to the process of exclusion maintained by privileged segment of society such that only those who are socially favored are able to obtain desirable social or economic benefits, or access to certain positions. This process can take the form of employment, housing or educational policies that favor certain groups and the exclusion of their out-group counterparts, previously known as systematic discrimination. Cumulative inequality theory suggests that both direct and indirect forms of inequality would continue over time and that these differences in access to resources and rewards become deeply embedded within the wider social structure. As a result, a hierarchy of privilege and disadvantage would appear over generations. The implications of CIT are significant. CIT suggests that an individual's lifestyle and opportunity is heavily influenced by their familial or generational status and not by their own will or merit. Furthermore, it theorizes that disadvantaged individuals and those from lower-class backgrounds are likely to remain disadvantaged, due to their lack of access to resources and advantages that can be attributed to their less-privileged situation and background. In sum, cumulative inequality theory is concerned with the disparities in resources or advantages that pervade a society across generations and the subsequent inequality of outcomes. CIT provides an explanatory framework that may be used to better understand existing social structures and existing disparities in wealth, opportunity, and resources.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 42044690}

Many of the compounds that cause wine faults are already naturally present in wine but at insufficient concentrations to adversely affect it. However, when the concentration of these compounds greatly exceeds the sensory threshold, they replace or obscure the flavors and aromas that the wine should be expressing (or that the winemaker wants the wine to express).

It is a branch of chemistry dealing with the chemical analysis of wine, as well as the science of winemaking. A wine's overall characteristics are heavily influenced by the acidity, flavor and aromas, as well as the physical properties of the wine such as its viscosity, color and sweetness levels. Some of these components are affected by the winemaking process while others are present at harvest. Chemical analysis of wine involves the identification and isolation of compounds that are responsible for the wine's physical and organoleptic properties. The most common methods for wine analysis include spectroscopy, chromatography, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. These techniques are used to measure the presence of different compounds in the wine and provide qualitative and quantitative data on what is present in the wine. The major types of compounds identified in wine are alcohols, acids, tannins, phenolics, zeaxanthin, pigments, and flavor and aroma compounds. The alcohols present include ethanol, methanol, glycerine and other higher alcohols. The acids identified in wine are tartaric, malic, lactic, succinic and citric acids. Tannins provide astringency, dryness, bitterness, and complexity to wines. Phenolic compounds are responsible for giving wines a deep color and add to the flavor profile. Zeaxanthin provides a yellow hue to white wines while pigments provide a hue to the red wines. The flavor and aroma components of a wine come from compound such as esters, aldehydes, terpenes, and sotolone. Wine chemistry is an important aspect of winemaking and analysis. It is critical to understand how different components in wine interact to create the desired physical, organoleptic, and flavor profile of the finished product. By understanding the chemistry of a specific wine, winemakers can better control their winemaking techniques and create superior wines.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 32186253}

The districts are used for the HU post town and other postal sorting operations. It covers the eastern areas of Kingston upon Hull and parts of the East Riding of Yorkshire, including Bridlington, Hornsea, Withernsea and Hessle. Postal codes in the HU area begin with the letters 'HU'. The HU districts are part of the larger geographical area of the North Humberside postcode area. In the map of the HU postcode area, the districts are further divided into two other sectors – North and South. North HU includes postcode districts HU1–HU7 while South HU includes postcode districts HU8–HU13. The postcode area was formed in April 1974 when the then separate urban and rural postcodes were aggregated to form the Humberside postal town. The area covered by the HU district matches the old area post-war boundaries of East Yorkshire. The various post towns that have postcodes in the HU area include Hull, Hedon, Avenues, Anlaby and Hessle. Hull is the main sorting office for the HU districts and was the original headquarters for Royal Mail before the divisions for delivery and sorting activities were moved to larger premises. In 2020, the majority of the postcode districts in the HU area are aligned with the district boundaries of Kingston upon Hull, with all of the HU districts in the East Riding of Yorkshire other than district HU6 being found within the boundaries of the city. The rest of the postcodes are distributed across different towns and villages as follows: HU1–HU3 are located mainly in the Avenues area of Hull; HU4–HU8 are mostly in the east of Hull, particularly around Anlaby; HU9–HU11 are in the east of Hull, including Hornsea and Withernsea; and the final two postcode districts, HU12 and HU13, belong mainly to Hedon, a small historic market town. Of the six postcode districts, HU1 is the busiest. It contains the significant population centres of Hessle, Hull City Centre, Bricknell Avenue and Brunswick Avenue. Additional postal sorting and delivering operations for the area are conducted from the East Hull delivery office in Hull. Most people in the area receive a local weekday delivery and a Saturday delivery. All mail for the postcode area, regardless of the first postcode sector, is sent to the Hull super hub in Hull for sorting.

Pasta salads sometimes include Italian dressing. The caloric content of Italian dressing varies widely.HistoryKen's North American style Italian salad dressing is thought to date back to 1941 in Framingham, Massachusetts. Florence Hanna, the daughter of Italian immigrants and wife of restaurateur Ken Hanna, made large batches of her family's salad dressing for the house salads at the restaurant. The restaurant, originally called The '41 Cafe, later changed locations and became known as Ken's Steak House. The salad dressing became so popular that it was made in large vats in the basement of Ken's to keep up with demand. Customers started requesting the Italian dressing to go. The Crowley family, who owned a nearby manufacturing business, approached the Hanna family about bottling the popular salad dressing. This resulted in the creation of Ken's Salad Dressing, which now comes in several variations of Italian, as well as many other flavors.Wish-Bone Italian salad dressing was also served in Kansas City, Missouri, at the Wishbone Restaurant beginning in 1948. The Wishbone had been opened in 1945 by Phillip Sollomi along with Lena Sollomi, Phillip's mother. The Italian dressing served at the Wishbone was based on a recipe from Lena Sollomi's Sicilian family which was a blend of oil, vinegar, herbs and spices. Demand for the salad dressing proved so high that Phillip started a separate operation to produce it for sale, making it by the barrel. The dressing recipe was eventually purchased by Lipton and has been made commercially by a succession of owners since, generating an entire Wish-Bone brand of products currently made by Pinnacle Foods, Inc.ReferencesSalad dressings Italian-American cuisine American condiments", "machine_text": ". Italian dressing is a salad dressing made from oil, vinegar, herbs and spices, and often garlic and anchovies as well. It is popular in North America and is usually the dressing of choice for Caesar salads. The exact ingredients of Italian dressing depend on the chef's individual tastes. Generally, however, ingredients as listed above are used, as well as other seasonings such as oregano, basil, pepper, onions, sugar, and sometimes mustard. Some dressings will also contain a variety of vegetables such as red peppers, olives, or artichoke hearts. Variations of Italian dressing can also include starchy ingredients such as rice or flour. Italian dressing has been served in North America since the early 1900s, and is thought to have originated from Italy. It was not usually done in Italian households, however, as it was generally thought of as an inexpensive American imitation of Italian vinaigrettes. Italian dressing was served in Italian restaurants to serve as an accompaniment to light foods such as salads and fish. The first commercial Italian dressing didn't appear in the United States until 1949, when Wishbone introduced their version of the dressing. In the years following, other brands also introduced their own Italian dressings, allowing it to become a staple found in virtually all American kitchens. Today, Italian dressing is popular not only as a salad dressing, but also as a marinade, flavor enhancer and topping for many dishes. It is often used to give additional zest to simple vegetable dishes, sandwiches, burgers and other foods. Although it may have a strong flavor for some people, Italian dressing is still widely enjoyed by many. Its light and tangy flavor is perfect for light vegetables and salads, and is an easy and convenient way to make salads and other foods tastier.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 3617892}

The mystery began when a local farmer, John Hall, reported finding a large painting of a dragon on the wall of his barn. The painting was done in an unusual style, with heavy brushstrokes and intense colors. Local villagers described the painting as being 'strange and otherworldly', and said that it had been there since at least the beginning of the century. The painting's origin and the artist remained a mystery for years, despite Hall's efforts to track down the person who had created it. He searched records and interviewed the locals, but no one knew who had painted it or why. Hall eventually took it upon himself to protect the painting and keep it from being destroyed. He posted a sign on the barn's door, warning people of a curse if anyone removed the painting. As the years passed, locals assumed the painting had been cursed and avoided it. Today, the painting remains where it was discovered, hanging on the wall of the barn. While many theories have been proposed, the true origin and purpose of the painting remain uncharted territories, leaving the mystery of the Painted Dragon unsolved.

Bilardi kept a blog describing his disdain for United States forces committing crimes against Muslims in the Middle East. He became radical after his mother died of cancer. By 2014, he expressed sympathy for Osama bin Laden on Facebook. Concerned that the Australian government was monitoring him, Bilardi turned to building explosives in the event he would not be able to leave the country.

Bilardi, an Australian-born Muslim, was a member of Ansar al-Sunna, an Islamic State-affiliated group in Iraq. Bilardi was raised in Melbourne by his mother and stepfather, both of whom were later identified as having been displaced from Iraq as children. He made the decision to travel to Iraq after becoming radicalised online, and in November of 2014, Bilardi travelled undercover to Iraq. Having been born and raised in Australia, Bilardi had never visited Iraq before. In Iraq, Bilardi underwent religious and military training, eventually joining the Ansar al-Sunna group. As part of this group, he participated in several attacks against Iraqi security forces, including a suicide bombing in Ramadi in 2015. Bilardi was one of the youngest foreign fighters to be actively involved in the conflict in Iraq. In March 2015, Bilardi was reported missing and in June of that year, his family confirmed that he had died in Iraq. In the following month, a video was released by the Islamic State showing Bilardi preparing to commit a suicide bombing in Ramadi. The video generated widespread debate in Australia, with many commentators questioning whether the Australian security forces had done enough to prevent Bilardi from travelling to Iraq in the first place. Bilardi's story has been the subject of numerous documentaries, articles and books. In particular, his story has been used to illustrate the difficulties faced by young Muslims in balancing their faith and their lives in a contemporary Western society and how radicalisation can occur as a consequence of the pressures associated with this. His story has also been used to encourage dialogue between governments, security services, and community leaders in order to prevent future cases of radicalisation occurring. Furthermore, academics have used his story to discuss issues of youth identity, the roles played by online radicals, and the limits of state security capabilities. In Australia, his story has been used as an example of the need to strengthen communication between security services and Muslim communities in order to identify and address potential sources of radicalisation. In 2015, the state government of Victoria established the Jake Bilardi Prevention and Support Services, which provides assistance to young people who are vulnerable to, or have already been affected by, extremist ideologies.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 46328622}

Between the time Amrhein began recruiting vocations and the outbreak of World War I, twenty Swiss compatriots had joined his young mission society. The war brought about the expulsion of nearly 70 German members of the Congregation from German East Africa, illustrating the drawbacks of having too great a focus on personnel from one country. To continue mission work, Archabbot Norbert Weber decided that it was necessary for the Missionary Benedictines to expand into non-mission lands.On September 16, 1919, Fr Adelrich Mühlebach, a Swiss citizen and member of the Congregation, opened a mission procure in Uznach, near the eastern shores of Lake Zürich, 50 km from Zürich. Following negotiations with the British government, which now controlled what had been German East Africa, this new foundation was recognized as the 'Swiss Benedictine Father'. This permission allowed the Missionary Benedictines to replace some of the German members who had been expelled from Tanganyika.For the next decades, Uznach acted primarily as a mission procure, rather than a true Benedictine monastery. The Congregation decided that a true monastic spirit should be fostered there, and in 1963, the community constructed a new monastery, dedicated to St Otmar. However, Swiss law prevented the foundation of monasteries, so the foundation remained a priory until the repeal of the relevant law in 1973. On January 6, 1982, the Congregation elevated the monastery to the status of an abbey, and Fr Ivo Auf der Maur became the first Abbot of Uznach. A new church was consecrated in 1988.Apostolate While maintaining the lifestyle of Benedictine monks, the abbey's community continues the important work of procuring funds for the Congregation's international missions. This includes the publication of a mission periodical, which is regularly distributed to the abbey's thousands of benefactors.Pastoral work is also a key part of the abbey's apostolate. Many of the priests help in parishes, and provide spiritual guidance to religious communities, the sick, and the elderly. Additionally, the monastery also hosts retreats and provides catechetical instruction.The Abbey of Uznach continues to send a large number of brothers and priests to the missions of the Congregation.DependenciesFribourg: A house at Fribourg, known as the 'Benedictinum', was in existence from 1937 to 1963. Due to Nazi actions against the Catholic Church, it was thought prudent to found a study house in a neutral state to provide for the formation of German and Swiss clerics. Raised to the status of a conventual priory in 1947, the Fribourg house was in fact the monastic center of the Swiss community, while Uznach continued to act as procure. However, staffing both Fribourg and Uznach was a strain on monastic community. Fribourg was abandoned in order to develop Uznach into a genuine monastery. Osornoe, Kazakhstan: Our Lady of the Plentiful Catch Monastery was erected in Osornoe on September 29, 2006. The monastery is located in the Archdiocese of Maria Santissima in Astana. Fr Joseph Schnider is the superior of the small community that resides there.Personnel As of May 18, 2011, the monastic community of Uznach included twenty monks in perpetual vows, around half of them ordained. Some of these monks are on assignment away from the abbey, including those at the foundation in Kazakhstan. There are also two brothers in temporal vows.Fr Adelrich Staub was elected Prior Administrator in 2010, succeeding Marian Eleganti, Titular Bishop of Lamdia, who had been the second Abbot of Uznach (1999–2009).See also Congregation of Missionary Benedictines of Saint OttilienReferencesFurther reading Godfrey Sieber, OSB, The Benedictine Congregation of Saint Ottilien, St Ottilien: EOS Verlag, 1992. pp 84–87External linksOfficial site (German)European Monasteries of the Congregation of Missionary Benedictines of Saint Ottilien Benedictine monasteries in Switzerland", "machine_text": " Uznach Abbey, sometimes referred to as the Abtei St. Gallen, was an Augustinian monastery located in Uznach, a small town located in the canton of St. Gallen, Switzerland. Founded in 1252 by Abbot Arnold, it was one of the most important spiritual and cultural centers in the region until it was disbanded in 1555 following the Protestant Reformation. The abbey was surrounded by a wall which was 2,800 feet long and 4 feet thick. It contained a number of buildings including the monastery itself, a bakery, a cattle house, stables, a brewery, a chapel, a mill, a hospice, a forge and several gardens and orchards. There was also a large cloister that connected the different parts of the complex. The monks of the abbey were known for their horticultural expertise and kept a wide variety of plants, including many medicinal herbs, in their gardens. The abbey also had extensive land holdings in the surrounding area which were used for grazing cattle, and for growing grain and legumes. Uznach was well known for its library which contained over 1,000 manuscripts and books from the Middle Ages. It contained works by important scholars such as Erasmus, Petrarch, and Thomas Aquinas. The abbey also produced fine pieces of art and commissioned a number of wooden carving of Biblical figures during the 16th century. Most notably, in 1523 the abbot ordered the production of a wooden statue of Christ which gained considerable fame in the area. The abbey had a number of important patrons including the counts of Toggenburg and the lords of Kerenbach. Although it remained in operation until 1555, its influence on the region’s culture began to wane in the 15th century due the rise of the Protestant Reformation and the abbey eventually closed its doors. Today, Uznach Abbey is remembered primarily for its library, its art works, and its contribution to the local culture. Parts of the wall are still standing and the site of the monastery is now home to a local museum which contains a collection of artifacts from the abbey. The wooden sculpture of Christ can still be seen in the local St. Ursula Catholic Church.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 36553450}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Cruising (driving)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Cruising is a social activity that primarily consists of driving a car. Cruising can be an expression of the freedom of possessing a driver's license. Cruising is distinguished from regular driving by the social and recreational nature of the activity, which is characterized by an impulsively random, often aimless course. A popular route (or 'strip') is often the focus of cruising. 'Cruise nights' are evenings during which cars drive slowly. A cruise can be a meeting of car enthusiasts at a predetermined location, organised predominantly through the internet (in recent times) but also largely through mobile phone, word of mouth or simply by a cruise being established enough that it becomes a regular event.Some ethnic groups identify with lifestyles related to cruising, such as the Hispanos of New Mexico, Chicanos, and Mexican-Americans of the Southwestern United States along U.S. Route 66. Meets, like those at lowrider and auto shows, are popular across the United States and worldwide in large part due to these ethnic communities.United StatesHistory There is no clear-cut date when casual driving turned into cruising along a specific route, although it generally began in the years after World War II with youths of Mexican heritage driving lowriders in Southern California towns, and it rapidly became a popular teenage activity.Cruising culture was an evolution of old traditions of strolling down Main Street or around the town square. Although cruising was predominantly boys showing off their cars (ostensibly to meet girls), groups of girls joined in cruising as well. One appeal of cruising was that youths could evade the supervision of parents and family.Driving slowly down long, straight streets, preferably with many traffic lights to increase opportunities to talk to other cruisers or pedestrians, was only one part of cruising. Cruisers would also gather in parking lots, particularly those of drive-ins. As a Tucson journalist noted, 'Cruisers, like moths and June bugs, eventually congregate around brightly lighted areas.' Cruisers were also apt to arrange impromptu races with other cruisers.As early as the 1960s, some towns established ordinances to prohibit driving through parking lots without stopping and the police issued tickets for loitering and curfew violations. Increasingly, cruisers would travel from wider areas to gather on popular strips, with police viewing these visitors as troublemakers. Reports of clashes between groups of cruisers began to appear in local newspapers.However, cruising continued to remain popular, with wildly painted vans and pickup trucks joining hot rods and muscle cars in the 1970s. In many locales, there was a generally positive relationship with law enforcement. Racing in populated areas was discouraged by police surveillance and traffic, but cruisers engaged in other games such as mooning onlookers, laying rubber when a signal turned green, and 'chinese fire drills' in which all occupants of a car stopped at a light would get out, run around the car, and jump back in.There was some decline in cruising in the 1970s, possibly connected to the rise of gas prices but also due to a growing change in community attitudes toward cruising. The San Francisco Bay Area had a 'cruising summit' in 1977 for area police to discuss 'our mutual problems with cruising'. The gathering numbers of vehicles and increases in tensions and violence led many communities to begin looking for ways to discourage cruising, despite many adults retaining a permissive acceptance of cruising with nostalgia for their own cruising days. Although business merchants and shoppers had been inconvenienced for years by cruisers, tolerance had dissipated and law enforcement was encouraged to step in.During the summer of 1974, Los Angeles police began cracking down on cruising, first by banning parking along Van Nuys Boulevard and then in August making it a one-way street. The following summer, as many as 15,000 youths from as far away as San Diego converged on Van Nuys, encouraged by local disc jockeys. A similar crackdown on Whittier Boulevard led to the formation of a cruiser's rights group. Police barricaded portions of Whittier in an attempt to disrupt cruising, but even local adults objected to this practice. Other measures were tried, such as shutting portions of Whittier down completely at night. Cruisers moved to Highland Avenue, resulting in the arrest of 170 during the second weekend of September 1979. The following summer, a section of Van Nuys was closed after 9 p.m. The rationale for the blockade was that it only required fifteen police to close the road, but they would need at least 150 officers to police the 15,000 cruisers who had gathered there.As quickly as one strip became unusable, cruisers would find new sites. It became a persistent battle between authorities and cruisers. In 1982, the California state legislature passed a law that gave cities express sanction to shut down streets being used for cruising, when driving 'for purposes of socializing and assembling interferes with the conduct of businesses, wastes precious energy resources, impedes the progress of general traffic and emergency vehicles, and promotes the generation of local concentrations of air pollution and undesirable noise levels'.Efforts to stop cruising continued, with increasing blockades and mass arrests. In 1985, random checkpoints began to appear, with police stopping cars passing the spot more than once in a given timeframe. Computers were added in 1988 to help track the cars. New curfews for minors were established. Cruising in southern California was generally suppressed by 1990. Other regions used tactics similar to southern California's, with similar mixed results. Police in Galveston, Texas began arresting cruisers, but had to back down in the face of parental complaints. Joplin, Missouri attempted a ban on cruising, but had to repeal it. Merchants in Portland, Oregon complained that they were losing business because of the crackdowns. Multiple towns across the U.S. adopted the checkpoint system.Other towns tried creative alternatives, such as Laurel, Mississippi and Princeton, West Virginia, which both channeled cruisers onto routes that would not interfere with local businesses. Setting aside parking lots specifically for cruisers was tried in Cedar Rapids, Iowa and Columbus, Indiana. The town of Big Stone Gap, Virginia chose to embrace cruising, awarding prizes for the best customized vehicles.Cities continue to struggle with the problems of cruising into the 2000s. In 2006, Milwaukee, Wisconsin even explored letting police confiscate cruisers' cars.While communities try to prevent impromptu cruising, multiple towns have embraced organized cruising revivals. The Woodward Dream Cruise occurs on the third Saturday in August along the original cruising strip in Detroit's northern suburbs. The event is a tribute to the classic Woodward cruisers and attracts approximately 1 million people and 40,000 muscle cars, street rods, and custom, collector, and special interest vehicles. Waukegan, Illinois, has an annual summer cruising festival called 'Scoopin' Genesee'. and Modesto, California celebrates 'Graffiti Summer' with an annual cruise parade. Renton, Washington hosts 'Cruz the Loop' each summer, and in 2020 erected a sculpture to honor cruising the loop.Well-known strips One of the oldest cruising strips in East Los Angeles is located on Whittier Boulevard. Cruising on this strip became a popular pastime among lowriders during the 1940s before spreading to surrounding neighborhoods in the 1950s.Van Nuys Boulevard in the central San Fernando Valley has been a popular cruising strip since the 1950s; the 1979 film Van Nuys Blvd. depicted the cruising culture on the strip. In the late 1970s, the Wednesday night cruise on Van Nuys attracted up to 40,000 cars. Sunset Boulevard was another popular cruise strip.Perhaps the most famous cruising strip (or main drag), however, is McHenry Avenue in Modesto, California.The cruising culture of the late 1950s and early 1960s was depicted in the film American Graffiti. The film was set (but not actually filmed) in director George Lucas's home town of Modesto, which also hosts an annual 'Graffiti Summer' celebration in the film's honor.Cruising in Detroit was popular from the 1950s to the 1970s in the city's northern suburbs along M-1 (Woodward Avenue), from Ferndale north to Pontiac. Cruising along Woodward reached its peak in the mid-1960s, with muscle car competitions that were covered by journalists from Car and Driver, Motor Trend, and CBS World News Roundup. Other popular cruising strips in the Detroit area include US 24 (Telegraph Road) from 12 Mile Road in Southfield to Michigan Avenue in Dearborn, and M-3 (Gratiot Avenue) on the East Side.United KingdomDescription There are two main types of cruise: regular cruises, also known as meets, and one-off cruises.The events that take place are similar; cars meet in car parks, park up or cruise (drive slowly) around the car park while people socialise – often meeting people from cruise websites, show off their cars and admire others' cars. If there is enough space there are often drag races, burnouts, and doughnuts.Meets A meet is a regular gathering, usually weekly or monthly, where the time and place is freely publicised and well known. It is becoming more common these days for these events to be referred to incorrectly as cruises.One-off cruises A one-off cruise is an event organised by a particular group of people or club which would usually be advertised through cruise websites.The final destination of the cruise is often kept secret; it is known only to the convoy leaders in an attempt to keep the cruise unknown to the police until there are a large enough numbers of people at the cruise to make it difficult to disperse.One-off cruises tend to be larger than meets, but larger meets may have magazine attendance.This type of cruise is increasing in recent times due to increased police interest in regular, established cruises.Some large cruises operate a 'convoy-only' policy.Locations Cruises are generally held in retail parks due to the large open car parks needed to accommodate high attendance numbers (sometimes more than 500 cars). Naturally, with many cruises situated in retail parks, most cruise locations are also in close proximity to fast food restaurants such as McDonald's or Burger King.Cruising and the lawAlthough cruising is often not a crime in itself, there are many illegal activities associated with it, and as such cruises are often monitored by the police or even closed. The most commonly cited reasons for breaking up cruises are breach of the peace, caused by loud exhausts and sound systems disturbing local residents, and dangerous driving (such as street racing, burnouts and doughnuts). Police also claim that cruises are used as cover for drug dealing and are attended by stolen or otherwise illegal cars. More recently, police have been using ASBO laws which enable them to seize and impound cars if anti-social behaviour is taking place or if a group refuses to disperse from an area.As a result of increased police powers, legal cruises have been established such as Weston Wheels, although these tend to resemble car shows with camping, music stages and trade stalls.This passive, organised nature often does not satisfy the desires of cruisers, so illegal cruising continues.Many city councils have successfully placed court injunctions to prevent boy racers parking cars in areas that have been popular with them.MagazinesCruising and modifying have long been represented in the commercial magazines Max Power, Fast Car and Redline.In mid-2006, Max Power, the magazine that brought cruises to the forefront, abandoned the scene – preferring to concentrate on 'dream' cars such as Nissan Skylines. Long-time rival Fast Car assumed Max Power's position and now covers multiple cruises across the UK in each edition.See alsoCar customizingHot rodCal-Style VWImport sceneStreet racingBack to the BricksSwedenRaggareUK and Republic of IrelandBoy racerChavSupercar SeasonScangerReferencesFurther readingAutomotive events Driving Kustom Kulture Transport culture", "machine_text": " Cruising (driving) is a type of recreational driving where individuals drive around the city or town they live in, in the late afternoon or evening, typically at low speed. It may be done in order to show off their vehicle, meet other drivers and socialize, or simply to pass time. Cruising is especially popular among teenagers and young adults. Cruising is a popular pastime in the United States as well as other countries across the world. In certain cities, cruisers will often wait for 'cruise night', a designated night of the week where physical locations in the city become staging areas for cars to meet up, idle and converse with other cruisers. It is also a form of parade, as the sight of multiple cars lined up can be appealing to passersby. Not all forms of cruising is recreational-oriented. Some drivers will gather for the purpose of tuning and tweaking their car's mechanics as a hobby. Other drivers may make a game out of 'tagging', which is the act of tagging another car with a sticker adhered to a driver's window or car body. Public debates have centered around cruising, as the practice can become a nuisance or distraction. Excessive noise, traffic obstruction, and illegal driving are all factors that are often associated with cruising. Despite efforts to discourage the practice, the action remains popular among those who live in suburban or rural communities. In many locations cruising has become a competitive sport of sorts, with competitions held to determine who has the best car and can show off their ride. The aim of competition is to demonstrate one's driving skills as well as the condition of their car. Maximum speed, acceleration and deceleration, as well as a driver's ability to respond to those of other drivers in the competition are all taken into account. It is important to note the distinction between cruising and street racing. Cruising is generally performed just above the speed limit, whereas street racing is much faster and a form of illegal racing which is usually considered a criminal offense. In summation, cruising (driving) is a form of recreational activity enjoyed by many individuals worldwide. It entails driving around the city or town at low speed and is often associated with gathering and meeting with other drivers. Cruising varies from street racing in that it is only done at normal speeds and is not considered a criminal offense. Despite its controversial nature, cruising is still a popular social activity that continues to attract new participants.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2473207}

He was promoted to grand master admonisher (zanshan dafu) by 979 and served primarily in a provincial civilian capacity. When Liu Kai requested Emperor Taizong of Song (r. 976-997) to send him to the battlefront against the Khitan Liao dynasty, he was given the office of attendant palace censor (dianzhong shi yushi).ReferencesBibliographyMilitary history of the Song dynasty947 births1000 deaths People from Hebei Song dynasty people", "machine_text": " Liu Kai (劉開; courtesy name Dijing (帝景)) (1022–1088) was a jinshi (禁史) and general in the Song dynasty of China.

In 1054, Liu was appointed as governor of Hedong (河東), a strategic port and military base in modern Shandong. During this tenure, he was faced with the complexity of Qiang nomads, who often crossed the borders and raided border regions. In 1064, Liu was appointed as a commander in the imperial army and led a detachment of troops to fight against the Tanguts of the Western Xia. Liu then played a decisive role in the Battle of Chengdu, which was a crucial battle in the war. During the battle, the Song army successfully routed the Tangut forces, routing them from their capital, Zhuozhou (涿州). In 1068, Liu was appointed to lead a naval attack on the Jurchens of the Jin dynasty, a hostile northern neighbour. He led the successful attack on the strategic ports located in the mouth of the Yalu River (烏爾流河). Despite inflicting heavy casualties, Liu's forces were eventually forced to retreat due to the superiority of the Jin forces.

Rising Storm was written by Kate Cary. The series follows the adventures of four Clans of wild, anthropomorphic cats. The plot follows Fireheart, newest deputy of ThunderClan, struggling to complete his duties as deputy, while still knowing that the previous deputy, Tigerclaw, is lurking in the forest somewhere, seeking revenge against Fireheart and his Clan.The book was first released as a hardcover in the US on 6 January 2004. It was then released in both paperback and e-book format. The UK has received the paperback version along with Canada. Rising Storm has been published in multiple languages, including Chinese, German, and French. Reviews for the book were mixed, with reviewers praising the suspense and cliffhanger ending; however, some reviews criticized the growing number of characters and lack of humor and depth.SynopsisSetting Rising Storm takes place in a fictional forest. The forest is home to four Clans of wild cats, ThunderClan, WindClan, RiverClan and ShadowClan, each of which lives in a piece of territory suited to their skills/abilities.The forest is based on New Forest in Southern England. In addition to the New Forest, Loch Lomond, the Scottish Highlands, and the Forest of Dean also inspired the fictional locales in the novel.Plot Fireheart is ThunderClan's new deputy, but the previous deputy, Tigerclaw, still haunts Fireheart's dreams. Fireheart wonders if ThunderClan would be ready if Tigerclaw attacked, as many of the cats are still shocked by Tigerclaw's disloyalty, and many warriors are still badly injured. Bluestar begins to become distrustful of the Clan after Tigerclaw's betrayal, trusting only her most senior warriors, and those who were not Clanborn.Bluestar, accompanied by Fireheart, goes to speak with StarClan, the Clans' warrior ancestors, at the Moonstone, located inside a disused quarry mine known to the Clans as Mothermouth. On the way there, a patrol of WindClan warriors stop them. The ThunderClan leader later fears that StarClan sent WindClan to stop them from going to Mothermouth and speaking with StarClan, which causes her to slip into further paranoia.Fireheart struggles with his disrespectful nephew and apprentice, Cloudpaw, who disobeys Fireheart's orders to stay away from Twolegs (humans), and is eventually abducted by them. Fireheart and his friend, Sandstorm, then go on a quest to rescue Cloudpaw. They find him, take him back, and he is accepted back into the Clan by convincing the Clan that he went against his will. Meanwhile, Fireheart struggles to cope with missing his best friend, Graystripe, who left ThunderClan with his kits to live in RiverClan, the kits' mother's Clan.The forest gets hotter and hotter as summer drags on, and eventually a wildfire sweeps through the forest. It destroys ThunderClan's camp and taking the lives of two elders, Patchpelt and Halftail, as well as Yellowfang, ThunderClan's senior medicine cat. At the end of the book, it is revealed at a Gathering that both Nightstar and Cinderfur, elderly leader and deputy of ShadowClan respectfully, have died from a sickness, and that Tigerclaw, now Tigerstar, is the new leader of ShadowClan.Publication history Rising Storm was first published as a hardcover in the US on 6 January 2004. The book was later also published as a paperback on 15 February 2005 and an e-book on 4 September 2007. In the UK, the book was first released on 2 October 2006 as a paperback. The Canadian version released early on 8 January 2004. It has also been translated into other languages such as German, Japanese, French, Russian, and Korean. The Chinese version was released on 30 November 2008, and also includes atrading card of Graystripe.Themes A major topic in this book is power. Tigerclaw is determined to take over ThunderClan, even after being banished from the Clan for trying to do so earlier. Other themes are violence and death. Booklist notes that 'teens may find their own journey toward adulthood echoed in the protagonist's struggles and self-doubts'.Critical reception Rising Storm was mostly well received by critics. In one review by Booklist, the reviewer calls the novel suspenseful, also noting how the story echoes the journey to maturity. Another review, by Voice of Youth Advocates, noted that while the books lacks humor and depth, there was still appeal in the hidden world of the warrior cats. A BookLoons review particularly praised the ending, calling it a cliffhanger. A review by Horn Book Review for both Rising Storm and A Dangerous Path was also positive writing 'The fourth and fifth entries in the series continue the development of the complex, dynamic characters'. However, Children's Literature was not as positive, saying it was getting hard to remember all of the characters' relatives and leaders.References2004 American novels American fantasy novels Warriors (novel series) Novels about cats Avon (publisher) books 2004 children's books 2004 British novels British fantasy novels British children's books American children's books", "machine_text": " Rising Storm is a young adult novel written by American science fiction and fantasy author Suzanne Collins.

Offering free education, it has been described as the 'largest university of the Medieval world'. Ibn Tumart, founder of the Berber Almohad dynasty, reputedly attended the school and studied under al-Ghazali. Nizam al-Mulk's son-in-law Mughatil ibn Bakri was also employed by the school. In 1096, when al-Ghazali left the nezamiyeh, it housed 3000 students. In 1116, Muhammad al-Shahrastani taught at the nezamiyeh. In the 1170s, statesman Beha Ud-Din taught at the nezamiyeh, before he moved on to teach in Mosul.The Persian poet Sa'di studied at the nezamiyeh from 1195 until 1226, when he set out on a thirty-year journey. He was also among those who witnessed first-hand accounts of its destruction by Mongol Ilkhanate invaders led by Hulagu during the Sack of Baghdad in the year 1258. Sa'di recalls clearly his days of studies at Al-Nizamiyya in Baghdad: 'A fellow-student at Nizamiah displayed malevolence towards me, and I informed my tutor, saying: 'Whenever I give more proper answers than he the envious fellow becomes offended.'

The university was one of the largest and most famous medieval universities in the world. It was a center of advanced learning with students gathering from all over the Islamic world. The university offered programs in literature, philosophy, science, theology and law. It was the first Islamic university to teach sharia law and became a peak of Islamic civilization. Instructors at the school included prominent writers such as Al-Ghazali, Al-Jahiz, Al-Mubarrad and Ibn al-Haytham. The curriculum was based on the Shi'a Ibn al-Mualem's al-Madkhal software and was divided into four main branches: theology, law, philosophy and Islamic sciences. Each student was required to take courses in the four main branches and then specialize in one or two subjects of interest. The university offered courses in a wide range of subjects, including literature, philosophy, science, theology and law. Courses in mathematics, astronomy, medicine and geography were also offered. One part of the university was dedicated to astronomy and astrology. Here, there was an observatory, where students could observe stars and planets. Historians believe that the observatory was one of the most advanced at that time. The library of the university is said to have contained the most famous works of Islamic scholarship. This included works of Islamic jurisprudence and philosophy, as well as classics of science, literature and poetry. The university played an important role in the development of Islamic science and culture. It was an important center of scientific and philosophical thought. Al-Nizamiyya is still seen as one of the most influential universities in the history of Islamic scholarship. The university has since been renovated several times, with the current renovation being completed in 2008.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Linear alkylbenzene\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Linear alkylbenzenes (sometimes also known as LABs) are a family of organic compounds with the formula C6H5CnH2n+1. Typically, n lies between 10 and 16, although generally supplied as a tighter cut, such as C12-C15, C12-C13 and C10-C13, for detergent use.The CnH2n+1 chain is unbranched. They are mainly produced as intermediate in the production of surfactants, for use in detergent.Since the 1960s, LABs have emerged as the dominant precursor of biodegradable detergents.Production Hydrotreated kerosene is a typical feedstock for high purity linear paraffins (n-paraffins), which are subsequently dehydrogenated to linear olefins: CnH2n+2→CnH2n+H2 Alternatively, ethylene can be oligomerized (partially polymerized) to produce linear alkenes.The resulting linear mono-olefins react with benzene in the presence of a catalyst to produce the LABs. Hydrogen fluoride (HF) and aluminium chloride (AlCl3) are the two major catalysts for the alkylation of benzene with linear mono-olefins. The HF-based process is commercially dominant; however, the risk of releasing HF (a poisonous substance) into the environment became a concern particularly after the Clean Air Act Amendment. In 1995, a solid catalyst system (the DETAL process) became available. The process eliminates catalyst neutralization and HF disposal. Consequently, most LAB plants built since then have utilized this process.Production details Given the large scale applications of LAB-derived detergents, a variety routes have been developed to produce linear alkylbenzenes:The HF/n-paraffins process involving dehydrogenation of n-paraffins to olefins, and subsequent reaction with benzene using hydrogen fluoride as catalyst.This process accounts for the majority of the installed LAB production in the world.It includes a PACOL Stage where n-paraffins are converted to mono-olefins (typically internal mono-olefins), a DEFINE Unit whose primary function is to convert residual diolefins to mono-olefins, a PEP Unit which is essentially an aromatic removal unit - introduced before the alkylation step to improve LAB yield and quality, an alkylation step where mono-olefins, both internal and alpha olefins, are reacted with benzene to produce LAB in the presence of HF catalyst.The DETAL process involving dehydrogenation of n-paraffins to olefins, and subsequent reaction with benzene using a fixed bed catalyst.This is newer technology and has several of the stages depicted in the HF/n-paraffins process, but it is principally different in the benzene alkylation step, during which a solid-state catalyst is employed.There is a developing transalkylation (TA) stage to the Detal process wherein any higher alkylated benzenes (HAB) are contacted with additional benzene over a transalkylation catalyst.The Friedel-Crafts alkylation process involves chlorination of n-paraffins to monochloroparaffins followed by alkylation of benzene using aluminum chloride (AlCl3) catalyst. This method is one of the oldest commercial routes to LABs.Each process generates LAB products with distinct features.Important product characteristics include the bromine index, sulfonatability, amount of 2-phenyl isomers (2-phenylalkane), the tetralin content, amount of non-alkylbenzene components, and the linearity of the product.The production of n-paraffins often occurs as part of an integrated LAB plant where the producers start from kerosene as raw material. The UOP process for producing normal paraffin includes a kerosene prefractionation unit, a hydrotreating unit and a Molex unit.The ExxonMobil Chemical technology includes a recovery process and can produce LAB grade n-paraffins from most medium to low sulfur kerosene without the use of a hydrotreater stage upstream.A desulfurization process is needed to reduce the sulfur content of some n-paraffinsApplications Linear alkylbenzene is sulfonated to produce linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS), a biodegradable surfactant. LAS replaced branched dodecylbenzene sulfonates, which were phased out because they biodegrade more slowly.Niche uses LAB was identified as a promising liquid scintillator by the SNO+ neutrino detector due to its good optical transparency (≈20 m), high light yield, low amount of radioactive impurities, and its high flash point (140 °C) which makes safe handling easier.It is also available in large volumes at a relatively low cost at the SNO+ site. It is now used in several other neutrino detectors, such as the RENO and Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiments. The material performs well in deep underwater environments. One study suggested LAB as a suitable material to be employed in a Secret Neutrino Interactions Finder (SNIF), a type of antineutrino detector designed to detect the presence of nuclear reactors at distances of between 100 and 500 km.Environmental considerations LAB has been subject to concern about its effect on the environment and human health.European Council Regulation (EC) 1488/94 led to it being extensively evaluated.The life-cycle analysis considered the emissions and resulting environmental and human exposures. Following the exposure assessment, the environmental risk characterization for each protection target in the aquatic, terrestrial and soil compartment was determined.For human health the scenarios for occupational exposure, consumer exposure and human exposure indirectly via the environment have been examined and the possible risks identified.The report concludes that there are no concerns for the environment or human health.There is no need for further testing or risk reduction measures beyond those currently practiced.LAB was therefore de-classified and was removed from Annex 1 in the 28th ATP (Directive 2001/59).ReferencesExternal linksMaterial Safety Data SheetAlkylbenzenes Phenyl compounds", "machine_text": " Linear alkylbenzene (LAB) is a homologous series of alkylbenzene compounds derived from aliphatic hydrocarbons and characterized by a linear single-bonded carbon chain. The chain can range from C6 to C9 for linear alkylbenzenes. Linear alkylbenzene is widely used as a feedstock in the petrochemical industry and is a component of several synthetic formulations. The compounds are used to produce lubricating oil and wax components, industrial detergents, synthetic rubber, and plasticizers. Linear alkylbenzene is also employed in the production of many consumer products such as detergents, fabric softeners, and antifoams. LAB occurs naturally in crude oil, but it is typically insufficient in quantity to satisfy consumer demands. It is therefore produced synthetically, typically by alkylation of benzene with olefins. The most common linear alkylbenzene production method is the Wurtz reaction. The Wurtz reaction involves combining Sodium with Anhydrous Benzene or Toluene and then using an olefin and AlCl3 in benzene solution to produce LAB. The reaction results in a mixture of products, whic can be separated by distillation. LAB is a hazardous material when ingested or regularly exposed to the skin and respiratory system. Ingestion of LAB can result in aspiration pneumonitis and cranial nerve problems. Long term exposure has been linked to cancer. Furthermore, LAB is an environmental hazard and can accumulate in the food chain due to its high water solubility. When used in consumer products, strict regulations must be followed in order to comply with global health, safety and environmental standards. Depending on the end use, LAB grades may require the removal of certain compounds by fractional distillation and solvent extraction. Due to its wide range of applications, linear alkylbenzene is a valuable, strategic commodity whose availability and prices are closely monitored by the global markets. Today, linear alkylbenzene is widely used in the detergent, chemical, and lubricant industries. It serves as a surfactant, emulsifier, and emulsion stabilizer in laundry detergents and fabric softeners, as a solvent in lubricants, as an anti-foaming agent in antifoam products and as an extractant for radioactive byproducts in nuclear plants. In the EU, it is listed on the Poison Center Database and its use is restricted in cosmetics and cleaning products. Overall, linear alkylbenzene is a key source of raw materials for a variety of industries and its use is increasing. It is a valuable resource that must be handled with care and proper precautions taken in order to ensure its safe and effective use.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 22761654}

The population of Fogo, which includes 15 other smaller islands, is 1,571 making it the least populated municipality on the island of Newfoundland.The major industry on the island is fishing, and the fisheries resources are managed by St. Mary's Bay Integrated Fisheries Management Plan. The other main industries on the island are tourism and construction. Fogo was first visited by Europeans in the 15th century and was originally known by the French as 'Magdalen's Land'. It is now home to various fishing villages, the largest of which, Tilting, is the administrative centre. Other communities on the island include Seldom-Come-by, Change Islands, Joe Batt's Arm-Barr'd Islands-Shoal Bay and Fogo. The name Fogo is derived from the Portuguese word 'fogueira,' meaning 'fire.' This is in reference to a boat that was lost off the coast of the island in 1762. In addition to the 15 communities on Fogo Island, the municipality also incorporates seven more remote islands, including Deep Bay, Little Fogo and Pollys Island. The north side of the island is an important site of nesting for Leach’s storm-petrels, while the south side and associated islands are important as a refuge for common eiders. Smaller shorebirds, as well as sea ducks, also inhabit the island, making it an important stopover for migratory birds. Fogo is connected to the mainland by ferry. The islanders are very proud of their community and have a strong culture, especially in the fishing industry. The residents are engaged in event management, artisanry, and often put on traditional music and dancing performances. In addition to local festivals, Fogo also hosts the annual NFLD Hog Jog, an event that is becoming more popular as anyone is welcome to participate in it. The Fogo Island Co-op is run by the community and offers a variety of services including a grocery store, post office, hardware store, gas station, and even a local television station.

When Ivan Lendl was chosen as champion for 1985, the panel's announcement was accompanied with a rebuke for Lendl's criticism of some tournaments and his refusal to play in the Davis Cup. Perry and Trabert were on the 1986 panel, with performances outside the Grand Slams taken into consideration.The 1990 designation of Lendl as champion was a surprise.That year, the Association of Tennis Professionals named Stefan Edberg its 'Player of The Year', in accordance with the ATP Rankings, while Tennis Magazine (France) ranked Edberg first, Andre Agassi second, and Lendl third. Tennis also suggested the ITF was punishing Edberg for denigrating the Grand Slam Cup tournament it had introduced. The ITF panel, of Perry, Trabert, and Frank Sedgman, called it 'the toughest decision any of us can remember having to make', and stated it was Lendl's better average performance in the Grand Slams that made the difference.The choice to award Djokovic the ITF World Champion of 2013 over Nadal was unexpected. Nadal finished the year ranked #1 and with more slams (2 to 1), more Masters titles (5 to 3), and more tournament titles (10 to 7).Similar to the situation with Edberg in 1990, the ITF cited Nadal's failure to win a match at 2 of the 4 slams (DNP the Australian Open, 1st round loss at Wimbledon) to justify their decision and Djokovic's consistent results across all four Slams (1 title, 2 runner-ups, 1 SF), Davis Cup (led Serbia to final, won 7/7 singles rubbers) and the ATP World Tour Finals (won title).Other instances when the ITF choices differed from the ATP rankings are 1978 (Jimmy Connors), 1982 (McEnroe), 1989 (Lendl).None of these, however, were controversial and were generally agreed upon, with the 1978 and 1982 choices being particularly clear cut in favor of Borg (1978) and Connors (1982).Women's singles The women's panel initially featured three former women's champions, Margaret Court, Margaret duPont and Ann Jones. Althea Gibson was a member through the early 1980s.ITF world champions for women differed from the WTA year-end rankings the following years: 1978 (Martina Navratilova), 1994 (Steffi Graf), 2001 (Lindsay Davenport), 2004 (Lindsay Davenport), 2005 (Lindsay Davenport), 2011 (Caroline Wozniacki), 2012 (Victoria Azarenka), 2017 (Simona Halep).DoublesBoysGirlsSingles (1978–2003)Doubles (1978–2003)WheelchairQuad's wheelchairSee also World number 1 ranked male tennis players World number 1 ranked female tennis players International Tennis Federation Philippe Chatrier Award ATP Awards WTA Awards Tennis statisticsReferences ITF ConstitutionFootnotesExternal linksHistory of tennis Tennis awards Lists of tennis players Tennis records and statistics International Tennis Federation ITF", "machine_text": " The ITF World Champions is an annual organization set up by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) in order to recognize the world's best male and female tennis players. Each year, a qualifying tournament is held with each winner earning the distinction of ITF World Champion in his or her respective category. The ITF World Champions is the most prestigious award in professional tennis. It signifies the peak of a player’s achievements in the sport. Every player that has earned ITF World Champion status has achieved the ultimate in worldwide recognition, having proved themselves to be the best of the best. The award is separated into two main categories: the men’s singles and the women’s singles. Each winner of the tournament earns the title of ITF World Champion and the privilege of displaying their title on any headwear they choose to wear. The qualifying tournament is divided into four rounds of competition. The first round of qualifying consists of 32 players playing in a single-elimination format. The remaining 16 players advance to the second round, where a round-robin format determines the advancement of the remaining 8 players. The players then play a single-elimination third round, with the four finalists advancing to the final round. Once the players advance to the final round, they play an elimination match to determine who will become the ITF World Champion. The winner of this match is awarded a gold medal with his or her name engraved on it, a cheque for 25,000 USD, and the title of ITF World Champion. The ITF World Champions is considered to be one of the greatest achievements in tennis. Having achieved ITF World Champion status, a player will have been crowned the best in the world and will have achieved their highest level of success in the sport. It is an honor that not all tennis players will ever achieve, and it serves as a reminder of just how high a level of excellence one must reach in order to reach the very top of their game.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 8419649}

It is believed to beendemic to Yunnan, China (in Kunming and Huize) and was suspected to be extinct since the early 20th century; the last verified specimen was collected in 1940.In 2004, a living female appeared from the pet trade in Kunming; one year later, a male from the same source and again one year later another female were found there. The validity of these specimens was doubted and many believed they were intentionally produced hybrids, a common technique in China to produce turtles that get high prices.In 2007, He et al. sampled the three living specimens and gave the genetic proof that all three living specimens are indeed C. yunnanensis and not hybrids. In 2008, Kadoorie Conservation China, a department of Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden, together with the Kunming Institute of Zoology and Chinese Academy of Sciences, discovered a small wild population. The distribution of this species remains unclear, but due to its value, it is heavily sought after. Protection measures are needed to save this probably highly endangered species from its return onto the IUCN list of extinct animals.ReferencesBlanck, T., Zhou, T.W. P.

This species has a high-domed carapace with a yellowish-orange or yellowish-brown background and bright, black-bordered brown markings.It can reach a maximum size of about 8 to 9.5 inches in length and is a member of the family Geoemydidae. The Yunnan box turtle lives in freshwater habitats and streams with clear, slow-moving waters and fallen leaf cover. It is an opportunistic omnivore that feeds on insects, small fish, worms, mollusks, crustaceans, aquatic plants and fruits, and occasionally carrion. Due to extensive overharvesting and destruction of its natural habitat, this species is now endangered and listed as a Vulnerable Species on the IUCN Red List. The Yunnan box turtle is primarily found throughout the basins of the west and middle Yangtze River and the Pearl River in China. With a mere ten percent of its original distribution left, its current habitat is restricted mostly to areas along the banks of the Yuanjiang, Lancang Jiang and Jinjiang Rivers. This species also inhabits parts of Tibet and Northern Vietnam, but these accounts have still not been confirmed. The main threats to the Yunnan box turtle’s survival are due to anthropogenic activities such as destruction of their habitats, overcollection and illegal trade. To protect the species, the Chinese government launched a captive-breeding programme at the Yunnan Wild Animal Conservation and Research Centre, which has released more than 100,000 captive-bred turtles into their natural habitats. Other impactful conservation actions such as banning the collection of wild Yunnan box turtles, enhancing natural habitats and improving the quality of existing protected areas led to the species’ IUCN classification being upgraded from Critically Endangered to Vulnerable in 2008. The Yunnan box turtle is a protected species under Chinese Law. According to the China Endangered Species Law, it is illegal to kill, sell or keep the turtles as pets. Therefore, it is important to raise public awareness of their existence in order to help protect the species from further decline. In addition, there is still a great need for further research on the species to provide more accurate estimates of its population. Generating public interest in the species also has potential to boost its conservation. The Chinese government is currently working with other countries to save the species through a variety of educational programmes and is using online campaigns to raise awareness of the threats faced by the Yunnan box turtle. This species is an important part of Chinese biodiversity and the importance of its conservation should not be overlooked.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 12507245}

She is the princess of the late Joseon Dynasty and is considered to be the last crowned ruler of the dynasty. She was the most beloved of her four siblings, which included the future King Gojong and Emperor Sunjong, as well as her two sisters. Princess Euncheon was born on 16 May 1963 as the daughter of King Chongryeol. She had two sisters, Princess Sinan and Princess Seonhwa, and two brothers, Crown Prince Gojong and Emperor Sunjong. From a young age, she was raised to be royalty and was doted on by her father. She had a special bond with her father and was given great education, preparing her to become a ruler one day. She was known to be quite intelligent and talented in music, despite her young age. At the age of seven, she was betrothed to the son of another Korean royal family, so she moved from the royal court to the prince's palace in the neighboring province. She remained at the palace until the outbreak of the Japanese Invasion of Korea in 1895. Following the war, her betrothed's family lost their power, prompting her to return to her father's palace in Seoul. In 1897, King Chongryeol passed away and Princess Euncheon became the Queen of Korea. During her reign, she brought a sense of progress to her kingdom, modernizing many outdated customs, and led efforts to promote education and the arts. Unfortunately, in 1898, Queen Euncheon died at the age of 35, just one year after taking the throne. Her legacy of reform and progress continues to be remembered today in her homeland. She is often praised as a wise and compassionate ruler, who worked hard to improve the country before her untimely death.

These honours are awarded to foreign monarchs, presidents and other significant individuals by the President of Estonia, or on behalf of the President by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or relevant minister. The most notable award is the Order of the Cross of the Eagle, which is the highest-ranking order of Estonia and is awarded to foreign heads of state and members of royal families. It is usually supplemented by the Order of the White Star, another statutory order of the Republic of Estonia. Other honours awarded include the Order of the National Coat of Arms, which is a decoration that recognises outstanding services to Estonia; the Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana, which is an order to recognise civil and military merit; the Order for Merits to Estonia, which is a decoration for services in the interest of Estonia; the Medal of Merit, which rewards those who have merit for the state; and the Medal for Services to Estonian National Culture, which is awarded for a special contribution to Estonian culture. The honours awarded by Estonia to foreign heads of state and royalty are often additional to those from other nations. For example, the King of Sweden was awarded the Order of the Cross of the Eagle on behalf of the President of Estonia in 2005, in addition to the Order of the Seraphim. The President of Bulgaria was awarded the Order of the National Coat of Arms in 2007, in addition to the Order of Civil Merit. The honours awarded by Estonia are generally seen as an essential part of diplomatic relations, and an expression of gratitude and respect that helps to build strong bonds between countries. The medals and awards given by the Republic of Estonia to esteemed foreign heads of state and royalty are a further demonstration of the efforts and commitment to friendly international cooperation.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 40539080}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Joint Body\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Joint Body is a 2011 American crime thriller film written and directed by Brian Jun and starring Mark Pellegrino and Alicia Witt. The film is about a convict who is abandoned by his ex-wife and prevented from seeing his young daughter. As a parolee he develops a relationship with a lonely and troubled woman, whom he saves from a violent attack, killing the assailant in the process. Once more on the run, he is forced to re-evaluate his freedom as he evades the law and faces demons from his past. The film was shot on location in various small towns in southern Illinois: Alton, Wood River, East Alton, and Jerseyville. Produced by James Choi, Brian Jun, and Max Velez for 40/West, the film premiered on April 29, 2011 at the Newport Beach Film Festival.Plot While doing time in prison for a violent offense, Nick Burke (Mark Pellegrino) is visited by his wife who informs him that after waiting for seven years, she is divorcing him and has taken out a restraining order against him to prevent him from seeing their daughter. Sometime later, after accepting the parole board's condition that he relinquish all custodial rights of his daughter, he is given his freedom. Now in his mid-forties and determined to start a new life, Nick tries to find his way back into society and move beyond his violent criminal past. He meets with his parole officer, finds a small motel room, and attends an AA meeting.Nick's younger brother Dean (Ryan O'Nan) visits him at the motel and describes his life as a newlywed and police officer, having just graduated from the police academy. Although their relationship seems strained, Nick still looks to connect with his brother, even though he never visited him in prison. Before leaving, Dean gives his older brother a gun for protection. Nick soon finds work at a manufacturing plant.At the motel, Nick meets a lonely and troubled stripper named Michelle Page (Alicia Witt), whose isolated life is interrupted by the deaths of her elderly neighbors. Nick asks his attractive neighbor out for coffee, and the two begin to share their stories with each other.One morning, Michelle's former acquaintance Danny Wilson (Tom Guiry), whom she hasn't seen in three years, shows up after his three-year tour of duty in Afghanistan, expecting to rekindle their relationship. Michelle hardly knows this man who has developed an obsession over her. When Michelle rejects his advances and his demands for a personal reward for his service to his country, he sticks a gun in her face and brutally rapes her in her room. Hearing the commotion, Nick runs to her room with his brother's gun in hand. In the confrontation, both men are shot — Danny is mortally wounded.In the coming days, Michelle visits Nick in the hospital as he recovers from his gunshot wound to the stomach. When he learns that Danny died from his wounds, and knowing that he violated his parole and would be sent back to prison—no matter how good his intentions in stopping the attack, Nick leaves the hospital with Michelle's help, and the two drive to the home of Nick's brother Dean and his pregnant wife. There they get a glimpse of a domestic life they have never known. The relationship between the two brothers remains strained, yet Nick reaches out to make some familial connection with Dean, whose only advice is to 'disappear'.The next morning, Nick and Michelle leave in Nick's old truck, knowing they have become outlaws on the run. They find solace in each other's arms that night in a motel. Soon after, police detectives arrive at Dean's house with the gun he gave his brother. Convinced that Michelle gave the gun to police, when Nick calls, Dean tells him that she betrayed him. Later, Nick confronts Michelle about the gun, and she swears she did not give it to the police — that they must have discovered where she had hidden the weapon. That night they have sex.In the morning, Michelle discovers that Nick has abandoned her, perhaps for her own protection. Later, back at her motel, Michelle is arrested by the police and she is taken to jail. Meanwhile, Nick drives to his daughter's school and meets one of her teachers, who tells him she is doing fine. After school, he observes his daughter leaving with her friends, but he does not approach her. Sometime later, on a quiet deserted lake, Nick floats across the water in his old boat.CastMark Pellegrino as Nick BurkeAlicia Witt as Michelle PageBellamy Young as Jane ChapmanTom Guiry as Danny WilsonRyan O'Nan as Dean BurkeCarlos Michael Hagene as Club PatronRobert Nolan Clark as Shop ForemanVis Brown as Commissioner RyanMatthew Linhardt as ToddEmma Ve as LawyerDaesha Lynn as Caroline 'Chaz' BurkeMatthew Terry as Ex-convictJames Anthony as Cappy KnightBradley Blackorby as Unnamed CopPaul Strathman as Lawyer at HearingMichael W.

The joint body is typically composed of members from different organizations, each of whom is charged with representing their organization’s interests during governance meetings. This type of system is often used in complex situations where collaboration is necessary to ensure a successful outcome; examples include intergovernmental negotiations, cooperative agreements, and granting agreements. Joint bodies generally focus on collaborative decision-making, often done through consensus-building between multiple parties. A formal agreement is usually required for a joint body to be legally binding and for any decisions made to carry real-world weight. This is often done in the form of a memorandum of understanding (MOU), wherein the parties involved agree to a set of specific terms and conditions under which the joint body will operate. While a joint body may not have the same level of legal authority as organizations like a court or legislature, decisions made under its auspices may be legally enforceable. Before a joint body can be formed, there must be an understanding of how decisions will be made. What this looks like depends on the nature of the situation, but it often includes guidelines for how members will be selected and how meetings will be conducted. The roles and responsibilities of each member should also be outlined, and any decisions that the joint body makes must be in accordance with the governing agreement. This may include a specific process for how votes are counted and what constitutes a majority vote. The most important aspect of a joint body is the agreement between the parties involved. This agreement should detail the expectations of all parties and serve as a basis for conducting meetings and pursuing projects. It should also address any potential conflicts that may arise between members, and provide guidelines for dealing with such disputes in a timely and equitable fashion. In short, a joint body is an important mechanism for facilitating collaboration between organizations, and can be an effective way to make decisions in complex or contentious situations. It requires the cooperation of all involved parties, and well-defined roles and expectations from each member. By establishing a joint body, parties can ensure that decisions are made through an equitable, collaborative process.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 40341140}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Poor Little Fool\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "'Poor Little Fool' is a song written by Sharon Sheeley and first recorded by Ricky Nelson in 1958.Background Sheeley wrote the song when she was 15 years old. She had met Elvis Presley, and he encouraged her to write. It was based on her disappointment following a short-lived relationship with Don Everly of The Everly Brothers. Sheeley sought Ricky Nelson to record the tune. She drove to his house, and claimed her car had broken down. He came to her aid, and she sprang the song on him. Her version was at a much faster tempo than his recording.The song was recorded by Ricky Nelson on April 17, 1958, and released on Imperial Records through its catalog number: 5528. The recording features the background vocals of the Jordanaires.On August 4, 1958, it became the first number-one song on Billboard magazine's then-new Hot 100 chart, replacing the magazine's Jockeys and Top 100 charts. It spent two weeks at the number-one spot. It also reached the top 10 on the Billboard Country and Rhythm and Blues charts. Following its success, Sheeley worked with Eddie Cochran.'Poor Little Fool' became a radio hit when it was released as part of a four-song extended-play 45 rpm disc, which was excerpted from the artist's second LP, Ricky Nelson. Responding to the buzz, Lew Chudd, the founder and head of Imperial Records, rushed out a single version (on both 45 and 78 rpm). Nelson objected, however, believing that the move would hurt sales of the EP. Under his contract with Imperial, the singer had approval rights for all picture-sleeve art, so to express his displeasure with Chudd's decision, he chose not to select a photograph for the 'Poor Little Fool' single. As a result, 'Poor Little Fool' was the only Ricky Nelson single released by Imperial to be issued in the United States without a photo in a plain-label, cut-out sleeve.ChartsOther versions The 'Dodgers' and Johnny Angel released a cover version of the song in 1958 on Skyway 45-119-AA.The Fleetwoods recorded it in 1962.Terry Black released a version of the song in 1965 on his debut album, Only 16, and it reached number six in Canada.

It is notable for being the first song ever to reach the Number 1 position on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song was composed by Sharon Sheeley, who had previously written and performed the 1957 hit single 'Dum Dum'. Not long after its release 'Poor Little Fool' overtook and replaced 'Tequila' as the chart leader. It stayed at the top spot for two weeks, and earned Nelson his first gold record in October 1958. Nelson had previously worked with Sheeley and her then-boyfriend, Eddie Cochran. During those sessions, Nelson became intrigued by a poem she had written. He decided to set the poem to music, with Sheeley co-writing new lyrics. She was also given the writing credit for the song, although Nelson was not credited as a writer. The lyrics describe how a girl has been fooled by an untrustworthy man, although it was not clear if it was written about a real-life experience. The song's lyrics are sung from a first-person perspective and this gave the recording a certain depth that had not been found in other rock 'n' roll recordings. Nelson's recording of 'Poor Little Fool' was included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's list of 500 songs that shaped rock and roll, and VH1 named it the 13th greatest song of the 50s. It was further included in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list at No. 257. In January 2006, Nelson's version of the song was named as one of the Songs Of The Century by the Recording Industry Association of America and the National Endowment for the Arts. It was also ranked No. 7 on Billboards list of the Top 100 Songs Of The Rock Era. The song has since been covered by a variety of artists, including Neil Young, Simple Plan, Howie Day, and others. A remake of 'Poor Little Fool' by country music singer Clay Walker was featured in an episode of the television series The O.C. in 2004. Walker's version was featured as the title track for his 2005 Greatest Hits compilation, and it was also released as a single.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 3843341}

Though Bill Harrah did not participate in the new casino's development, the facility was re-branded Harrah's Marina Resort prior to opening. The new casino was located in the marina district – the first casino in Atlantic City not located on the famous boardwalk. Harrah's Waterfront Tower rises 46 stories above the Marina in Atlantic City.Harrah's opened on Saturday November 22, 1980 with a 506-room hotel tower, now known as the Coastal Tower, and became the top-grossing casino in the city. In 1986, Harrah's opened the new all-suite Atrium Tower, due to the complex's popularity and the opening of Trump's Castle across the road. Another expansion occurred in 1997 with the opening of the Marina Tower. The Harbour, Atrium, and Marina towers each stand at 16 stories tall, and the Atrium Tower is connected to the Coastal and Marina towers by hallways on each floor. In 2002, the 25-story Bayview Tower opened, along with expanded gaming space.The Waterfront Tower opened in 2008, along with a new pool and a spa, to better compete with the nearby Borgata, which opened in 2003. The hotel tower is Atlantic City's second tallest building, at 525 feet. At night, the entire surface of the tower displays varying digital images. On a square footage basis, this installation is believed to be the largest exterior LED display surface in the world.In November 2016, Harrah's began renovating the 450 Bayview rooms/suites. The rooms will look like the ones in the Valley Tower at Harrah's in Las Vegas. Floors 4, 5,6 were done before Christmas 2016 and opened on December 23, 2016. The full renovations were completed in 2017. In late 2018, Harrah's announced its 507 room/suite Harbour Tower would be renamed the Coastal Tower and completely renovated to look similar to the recently renovated Bayview Tower rooms. The first set of rooms will open on Thursday February 7th, 2019, and the rest of the rooms should be completed by summer 2019.In July 2020, Eldorado Resorts acquired Caesars Entertainment, taking over operations of the property. In connection with that acquisition, Vici Properties bought the real estate of Harrah's Atlantic City for 599 million and leased it back to Eldorado (newly renamed as Caesars Entertainment).Restaurants and shops Harrah's features a variety of restaurants, both for fine and casual dining (including a restaurant by Gordon Ramsay), and a small collection of stores.Entertainment The 800-seat Broadway by the Bay Theater opened on December 31, 1980, with singing team Sandler and Young. The room featured many of the staples of Harrah's properties in Reno and Lake Tahoe including Sammy Davis, Jr., Andy Williams, The Oak Ridge Boys, Marilyn McCoo, Shecky Greene and Suzanne Somers. Many professional boxing events have also been held in the theater. In 2007, the room was remodeled to feature theater-style seating and 400 seats were added. The 1200-seat theater was renamed The Concert Venue. Recent headliners have included Ron White, PennTeller and Patti LaBelle.EventsSports Boxing matches are held at the casino.Elizabeth Arden Red Door SpaThe Elizabeth Arden Red Door Spa is a state-of-the-art spa located next to the domed pool in the new expansion of the resort.

The casino is one of the most iconic in the city and has long been a stalwart of the local economy. Harrah's was owned and operated by Caesars Entertainment Inc., and was affiliated with their Total Rewards Program. The property was one of the most visited tourist attractions of Atlantic City, and one of the most successful casino resorts in the Northeast. Harrah's first opened in June 1979, and soon became a mainstay of the Atlantic City skyline, setting the standard for city luxury and visitors' experience alike. As the large cities surrounding, such as Philadelphia and New York City, saw an increase in tourism, Atlantic City's fortunes shifted as it became a more mainstream tourist destination. This became especially true in the case of Harrah's, where visitors had the opportunity to experience the ultimate in gaming, entertainment, and luxury. Harrah's boasts a wide array of casino games, with slots, poker tables, and traditional table games such as blackjack and roulette. In 2006, the hotel announced a major expansion and renovation, including the construction of a new 1,000-room hotel tower, a new 486,000 square-foot casino, and an aquarium - one of the largest in the country. This new addition made Harrah’s one of the largest properties on the East Coast, and added to the overall charisma of Atlantic City. In 2013, Caesars Entertainment announced that it was planning to close Harrah's Atlantic City due to declining revenue and competition from newer casino resorts. The resort was temporarily closed on September 8, 2020 due to economic issues related to the Covid-19 pandemic. The closure of the resort, along with those of other Atlantic City casino resorts, led to hundreds of lost jobs and the closure of numerous businesses in the city. Harrah's Atlantic City Casino will remain a beloved destination in the memories of many people, and will forever remain an iconic symbol of Atlantic City's history. With its closure, the city is left to look ahead to the future and build on the foundations of its success to find a new path forward.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 13727744}

The Rockland house is designed in the federal-style and both inside and out is marked by its unadorned, symmetrical façade. The interior of the house showcases detailed millwork and plasterwork and areas of both carpets and wide plank flooring, harkening back to colonial times. Today, the Rockland has become a venue for classical music, dance, and other cultural events, as well as being a popular tourist attraction. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975, and has been a West Virginia Historic Landmark since 1986. It has also been noted as one of the best-preserved examples of the federal-style period of architecture in the United States. The house and grounds can also be rented for private events or corporate meetings. In addition to the estate, the grounds include several English boxwood gardens and many of the historic outbuildings, including an 1840s springhouse, log cabin, smokehouse, icehouse and formal rose garden.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Corruption in local government\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Because there are many factors that can lead to corruption in local government, it is hard to study corruption patterns empirically, but recently, improved research strategies and information sources have made such studies better.Types There are several types of political corruption that occur in local government. Some are more common than others, and some are more prevalent to local governments than to larger segments of government. Local governments may be more susceptible to corruption because interactions between private individuals and officials happen at greater levels of intimacy and with more frequency at more decentralized levels. Forms of corruption pertaining to money like bribery, extortion, embezzlement, and graft are found in local government systems. Other forms of political corruption are nepotism and patronage systems. One historical example was the Black Horse Cavalry a group of New York state legislators accused of blackmailing corporations.Bribery is the offering of something which is most often money but can also be goods or services in order to gain an unfair advantage. Common advantages can be to sway a person's opinion, action, or decision, reduce amounts fees collected, speed up a government grants, or change outcomes of legal processes.Extortion is threatening or inflicting harm to a person, their reputation, or their property in order to unjustly obtain money, actions, services, or other goods from that person. Blackmail is a form of extortion.Embezzlement is the illegal taking or appropriation of money or property that has been entrusted to a person but is actually owned by another. In political terms this is called graft which is when a political office holder unlawfully uses public funds for personal purposes.Nepotism is the practice or inclination to favor a group or person who is a relative when giving promotions, jobs, raises, and other benefits to employees. This is often based on the concept of familism which is believing that a person must always respect and favor family in all situations including those pertaining to politics and business. This leads some political officials to give privileges and positions of authority to relatives based on relationships and regardless of their actual abilities.Patronage systems consist of the granting favors, contracts, or appointments to positions by a local public office holder or candidate for a political office in return for political support. Many times patronage is used to gain support and votes in elections or in passing legislation. Patronage systems disregard the formal rules of a local government and use personal instead of formalized channels to gain an advantage.Demographic factorsSocioeconomic characteristics and the size of the population of people that make up a municipality can be encouraging factors for local government officials to engage in corrupt practices. Patterns of political corruption can be found in places that have a similar demographic make-up. Demographic factors that have been known to lead to or increase the likelihood of corruption in a local government system are religion, race, class, size of the municipality, local economic conditions, education, political culture, and gender. Some factors are interrelated or can lead to other factors which may cause more corruption.Size of a municipality Smaller municipalities may be more prone to experience corruption within their local government. These towns and villages nominate (or self-nominate) residents or officials to represent and run the local government, sometimes without oversight approval from higher levels of government. In a small community, personal opinions and relationships play a larger role in politics. Due to this, problems like nepotism or extortion can be prevalent. In addition, some local governments face another kind of disadvantage - lack of experience and professionalism from their representatives. It can be a challenge to attract qualified up and coming politicians to small towns. Another major issue in small municipalities lies with accountability - some have inadequate or insufficient structures for policing and prosecution of corrupt local officials, culminating in a difficult situation for those affected.Condition of the local economy Low economic development has been found to be an encouraging factor for political corruption. Economic practices like dependence on raw material industries and drug trades are characteristic of poorer cities and areas with increased amounts of corruption. Economic dependence on certain industries will also lead to less stable governments and less money available to fund governments. Fragile economies lead to increased levels of poverty and less opportunities to get out of poverty. Poverty is a known factor that encourages corruption in local governments. Places with failing economies and poverty sometimes get loans or start aid programs to support the local economy and the people, and public officials are often able to unlawfully take the money or goods for private gain. With less money available, local officials are more likely to get lower wages, which is seen as another factor that leads to corruption. Officials who get lower wages, which are not enough to provide for their necessities, will many times become corrupt and try something like embezzling money that may entrusted to them in the local treasury. Low wages can cause economic insecurity and encourage politicians to take advantage of current opportunities as public figures of authority. On the other hand, some researchers argue that the more money a local government has to spend, the more tendency it will have to do so inefficiently, which can lead to suspicions of corruption. Overall, poorer municipalities are more often perceived to have corrupt local governments than rich ones.Education Lower levels of education which are often caused by poverty are seen as a factor which encourages corrupt government practices. Those with less education are not as informed as to how the government works or what rights they have under the government. It is easier for corrupt office-holders to conceal corrupt activities from a poorly educated public. Uneducated citizens are less likely to be aware of corruption in local governments or how to stop it, and therefore, corruption is able to remain and spread. Without some kind of political awareness, citizens will not know which candidates to elect that are honest or dishonest or other ways to prevent corruption from taking place in their local governments. This often leads municipalities to be continually governed by one or more corrupt local officials who use patronage or nepotistic practices to stay in office or keep influence in the government for long periods of time. When local political leaders are less educated, they will be less likely to find legitimate ways to make the municipality well-structured, productive, and successful.Political culture of municipality Many local governments have an established political culture with certain expectations and practices that often determine what is seen as acceptable and not acceptable in local politics. In municipalities with an undeveloped or underdeveloped political culture, accountability and legitimacy is usually low and principles of ethics in government are not established. This can encourage corruption to take hold in the local government because citizens do not know what is considered corrupt, and local officials are not afraid to be corrupt because of the low accountability.In some places the local governments have been corrupt for so long that the citizens think that is how it is supposed to work because that is all they have been exposed to. Long periods of political instability will also lead to corruption in the government because people are unsure of how the government should operate, and thus do not know what practices are corrupt or how to stop them if they are corrupt.Links and referencesAcademic referencesThe Causes of Corruption: A Cross-National Study, Daniel Treisman, Department of Political Science, University of CaliforniaConsequences and Causes of Corruption – What do We Know from a Cross-Section of Countries?, Johann Graf LambsdorffA Handbook on Fighting Corruption, CENTER FOR DEMOCRACY AND GOVERNANCE, U.S. Agency for International DevelopmentWeb referencesCorruption and Development, CHERYL W.

Corruption can take place within all levels of government, whether it be local, state, or federal, however, the highest prevalence of corruption tends to occur at the local level. This type of corruption has a number of causes and effects that are detrimental to the citizens of the local community. Common Causes Corruption in local government is caused by a number of different factors. One of the primary contributors to this issue is the lack of competition in local politics. Many local cities and towns lack the resources to conduct public elections that would select the most qualified official, instead having to rely on the reelection of incumbent officials. These individuals are able to abuse their connections and power to remain in office without much opposition from other challengers. Other factors contributing to local government corruption include the availability of ample government resources for personal gain, lack of oversight and accountability, and ineffective organizational structures and procedures. Effects The prevalence of corruption in local government has a wide variety of detrimental effects on citizens. The greatest detriment occurs when officials use their positions for personal gain, resulting in skewed public policy and a misallocation of public funds. This form of corruption leads to the creation of ineffective laws and policies that prioritize the benefits of the few individuals in power rather than the interests of the public. This harm is compounded when government officials take bribes or engage in kickback schemes, which drain public money while allowing those involved to enjoy financial benefits. When these types of activities are occurring on such a large scale, it also tends to have a serious effect on society's perception of local government. Citizens begin to lose faith and trust in their locally elected officials and their ability to act in their constituents’ interests. This can lead to a culture of apathy and disengagement which can make public engagement and accountability even harder to achieve. Ways to Reduce Corruption There are a number of different strategies that can be used to try and reduce the prevalence of corruption in local government settings. Anti-corruption rules and regulations should be established and widely enforced to ensure that no individual is able to abuse their power for personal gain. Additionally, local governments should also strive to increase transparency and accountability to citizens by giving them better access to information concerning their elected officials and the decisions they are making. Finally, officials must be held to high ethical standards, and any cases of corruption must be punished and dealt with accordingly. Overall, the issue of corruption in local governments is an unfortunate reality that has a serious effect on citizens’ trust and confidence in their elected officials. To combat this issue, citizens must remain diligent in their efforts to ensure that their locally elected officials do not abuse their power and that they are held to a standard of transparency and accountability. Additionally, governments must invest more resources into preventing corruption and stiff penalties must be enforced to those that are found in violation.

The film takes place in the Philippines in 1900 during the Philippine–American War.Plot Amigo centers on Rafael Dacanay, kapitan of the fictional barrio of San Isidro in a rice-growing area of Luzon. His brother Simón, head of the local guerrilla band, has forced the surrender of the Spanish guardia civil outpost and charged Rafael with the task of imprisoning the guardia Captain and the barrio’s Spanish friar, Padre Hidalgo, in the name of the First Philippine Republic. But when the American troops chasing General Emilio Aguinaldo arrive, the Spanish officer and Padre Hidalgo are freed, and a garrison under the command of Lieutenant Ike Compton is left to 'protect' the barrio. The American occupation policy now changes from 'hearts and minds' to 'concentration' (what was called 'hamletting' during the Vietnam war) and Rafael has to answer to both the Americans and the Filipino nationalists, with deadly consequences.CastDevelopment Cinematical reports that the film was once titled Baryo, and that the idea for it came from a yet-to-be-published novel Some Time in the Sun, detailing U.S. imperialism in the Philippines. The book will actually be called A Moment in the Sun, though the unrealized screenplay which inspired it was called Some Time in the Sun.The screenplay was written in two weeks and it was filmed over eight months on the island province of Bohol.Sayles said the 'amigo' of the title was the mayor: The American soldiers were always asked, “Is he a good amigo or a bad amigo?” There was some irony to him being called an amigo. However, the complication in that movie that the usual war movie, you follow the guys on one side and the other side is the enemy. You root for the guys on your side and the other side is shooting at them. This is a movie where it’s almost evenly divided. Forty-eight percent is in English, 48 percent is in Tagalog, and there’s a little Cantonese and Spanish thrown in. So the audience is asked to do something they’re not normally asked in a chronological war movie, which is to spend time with all the combatants and the noncombatants. They, therefore, know more than any, one character does. That affects the structure as well, but there is just a structure of events. But how you feel about those events is different because you get to be on both sides and actually care about people on both sides. In a way, what I hope is that by the end of the movie, you’re hoping that they won’t have a confrontation, but that confrontation is inevitable.Release It was screened on September 14 at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival.

The film stars Joel Torre as Rafael 'Amigo' Dacanay, a local mayor caught in the middle of a Philippine-American insurgency at the turn of the twentieth century. The film begins in 1900, with a group of American soldiers led by Major Monroe (Garret Dillahunt) arriving in a small village in the Philippines in an effort to quell the insurgency. Rafael 'Amigo' Dacanay (Joel Torre) is the mayor of the village, a former Spanish soldier who has worked hard to keep the peace in the area. His efforts are complicated by the presence of local guerillas fighting for Philippine independence, and he is soon caught in a conflict between what he perceives to be his responsibility to his community and his loyalty to the American forces. Throughout the film Amigo is forced to grapple with the consequences of making seemingly impossible choices. He must decide whether to stand up for his constituents or to help the Americans with their mission. He also faces pressure from within his community surrounding his leadership, as his fellow villagers often express discontent with his decisions. In a symbolic attempt to bridge the gap between himself and his people, Amigo walks a tightrope that stretches above the village, as if to demonstrate his own vulnerability in a situation beyond his control. The film received considerable critical acclaim, with particular praise coming for Sayles' direction and Torre's performance. It was nominated for Best Feature Film at the 2010 Asian Pacific Screen Awards, and was an official selection at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Zurich Airport\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Zurich Airport (, ) is the largest international airport of Switzerland and the principal hub of Swiss International Air Lines. It serves Zürich, Switzerland's largest city, and, with its surface transport links, much of the rest of the country. The airport is locatednorth of central Zürich, in the municipalities of Kloten, Rümlang, Oberglatt, Winkel, and Opfikon, all of which are within the canton of Zürich.HistoryEarly years In the Zurich area, mixed civil and military air traffic developed from 1909 onwards at Dübendorf airfield, northeast of the city. From 1919, the airport was home to Swissair's predecessor Ad Astra Aero, and from 1932 also to Swissair. The first international flight from Switzerland landed on July 21, 1921.In the early years of aviation, the Dübendorf Air Base, located someto the Zurich Airport, also served as the city's commercial airfield. The need for a dedicated commercial facility led to the search for a location at which to build a replacement airport.In 1939, civil air traffic had to be suspended at the outbreak of the Second World War for military strategic reasons. Although Swissair was allowed to resume scheduled air traffic in September 1940, this remained on a modest scale during the war.In March 1943, the government of the canton of Zurich commissioned a study to identify possible locations for the construction of a major airport. In its report, a consortium of engineers and architects led by LocherCie company advised against the previously discussed expansion options at Dübendorf airport and instead recommended a separate civil airport in the partially forested moorland area of the armory situated between Kloten and Oberglatt. In August 1943, the Federal Military Department declared its agreement to abandon the armory as a matter of principal 'in the higher national interest'.LocherCie submitted 'Project I' to the Government on 31 December 1943. Four runways were planned and together with the buildings the required area was 472 hectares. Without the purchase of land, the project would have cost 87 million CHF. The government found the costs too high and ordered a revision. The 'Project II' of 29 April 1944 still provided for an area of 290 hectares and costs of 65 million CHF, but the government council demanded a further reduction. For 'Project III' of 31 July 1944, 54.4 million and 215 hectares were required. The project nevertheless met the requirements of an intercontinental airport. The Government formally approved it and submitted it to the Federal Government, strongly emphasizing that the Zurich project was 'far superior' to the also planned (and ultimately abandoned) Swiss Central Airport Utzenstorf near Bern.In December 1944, the responsible Federal Councillor, Enrico Celio, explicitly spoke out in favour of Zurich-Kloten, in a letter to his counterparts, as did the governments of the cantons of Eastern and Central Switzerland and Ticino a month later. The National Council and Council of States followed this view and on 22 June 1945 approved the 'Federal Decree on the Expansion of Civil Airports'. Basel, Bern and Geneva were to receive smaller continental airports and be supported with a 30 percent share of the costs. The Zurich project was granted the status of an intercontinental airport and the highest possible subsidy rate of 35 percent.Switzerland's federal parliament decided in 1945 that Zürich was to be the site of a major airport, and soldof the Kloten-Bülach Artillery Garrison () to the canton of Zürich, giving the canton control of the new airfield. Construction of the airport began the following year.Initial plans for the airport, as laid out in the Federal government's scheme of 1945, were centered on facilities capable of handling international airline traffic. Aircraft of up to 80 tons were envisaged. The primary runway was to be designed for use in all weathers and at night, with a -wide hard surface running toin length. Additionalareas were to be provided on the shoulders for lateral protection in case of runway excursions. Additional domestic runways, betweenin length, were also to be built.First stage of construction: civil engineeringOn 25 February 1946, the Zurich Cantonal Council approved a building loan of 36.8 million. The cantonal referendum of 5 May 1946 resulted in a clear approval with 105,705 votes in favour, 29,372 against. 'Project IV' never came to fruition, as it was further developed by adapting it to the ICAO standards which were changing rapidly at the time. Instead of four runways, the new 'Project V' of 20 May 1946 provided only three. Project VI' of 9 October 1946 increased the dimensions of all three runways. Finally, the slightly modified 'Project VII' of 20 December 1947 was realised. Within three years, the design on the drawing board had completely changed from a purely grass airfield with a four-runway system without taxiways to a three-runway system with paved taxiways. The staggered design meant that it was possible to react to changes without having to impose a complete halt to construction.Construction works finally began on 5 May 1946 with the diversion of the Altbach stream. The 1900 m long West Runway 10/28 was the first runway which was opened on 14 June 1948, and on which the first Swissair Douglas DC-4 took off for London. On behalf of the canton as airport owner, Cantonal Councillor Jakob Kägi gave a speech to mark the inauguration of the new runway and the start of provisional flight operations. Shortly after, on 17 November 1948, the 2600 m long blind runway 16/34 (runway with instrument landing system) was opened for operation, which was attended by the seven members of the cantonal government. In the presence of invited guests from politics and the media as well as representatives of the construction companies and airlines, the new airport was inaugurated, which meant that the relocation of the entire civil flight operations from Dübendorf to Kloten had already been completed and full operation could begin at the new Zurich airport.The 1535 m long Bisen runway 02/20, which belonged to the three-runway system of 1948, was of little importance. Due to the applicable crosswind regulations at that time, the runway was designed to face the Bise in order to guarantee the airport's all-weather capability. However, the ICAO increased the crosswind tolerances for aircraft in subsequent revisions to such an extent that the runway was decommissioned after just over ten years.First stage of construction: structural engineeringThe character of a provisional solution was supported - despite full operation - by the lack of buildings, especially the 'Flughof', which had been planned since 1946. Instead, a growing shanty town stood to the east of the reserved building site. On 27 October 1948, the canton outsourced the development, construction and operation of the buildings to the newly founded 'Flughafen-Immobilien-Gesellschaft' (FIG), a mixed-economy public limited company in which the public sector held half of the shares (canton of Zurich 22.5", "machine_text": " Zurich Airport (known officially as Zürich Kloten Airport and sometimes referred to as Zurich International Airport) is an international airport located in the Swiss canton of Zurich and the district of Kloten, 10 km north of central Zurich.

Clark is also the Brazilian athlete who achieved the best result in the Brazilian delegation, making it to the quarterfinals in women's snowboard cross, finishing ninth overall.The substitute on the Bobsleigh team, Claudinei Quirino, was a silver medalist in the Summer Olympic Games, where he finished second in Sydney with the Brazilian 4 × 100 m relay team. By participating in the Winter Games, Quirino became the second Brazilian man to have participated in both the Summer and Winter Games (the first was Matheus Inocêncio, who participated in Salt Lake 2002 and Athens 2004). On the women's side, Jaqueline Mourão became the first woman to have achieved this feat: she had participated in the mountain bike competition of Athens 2004 and in Turin 2006, she took part in the 10 km classical.On 22 February, the Brazilian Olympic Committee announced, in Rio de Janeiro, that alpine skier Nikolai Hentsch was to be the flag bearer for Brazil at the closing ceremonies of the Winter Games. For the closing ceremony, all the nine athletes participating in the Games remained in Turin. The Brazilians were seated by the organization in a privileged spot: in the first row immediately behind the podium where IOC president Jacques Rogge and the president of the Turin 2006 Organizing Committee, Valentino Castellani, delivered their speeches.Alpine skiingNikolai Hentsch competed in four of the five alpine skiing events, and had the Brazilian alpine team's best finish, placing 30th in the giant slalom.Note: In the men's combined, run 1 is the downhill, and runs 2 and 3 are the slalom. In the women's combined, run 1 and 2 are the slalom, and run 3 the downhill.BobsleighOn 13 February, the Brazilian Olympic Committee announced that Armando dos Santos' preventive antidoping test, which had been done in Brazil on 4 January, was positive for the forbidden substance nandrolone. Santos was ejected from the team, being replaced by former sprinter Claudinei Quirino, the team's substitute athlete.On 18 February, the Australian Olympic Committee filed a request with the International Olympic Committee, claiming that the qualification of the Brazilian team to the Olympics was invalid, and thus the Brazilian team should not be allowed to compete. The claim of the Australian Committee revolved around the circumstances of the qualification: the Brazilians earned their spot in the Games by winning the 2006 Challenge Cup, in late January, which awarded two spots in the Olympics.That event took place two weeks after Armando dos Santos' anti-doping test, which turned out to be positive, had been performed, although the result was only divulged on 13 February. In that event, New Zealand came in second, which earned them a spot in the Olympics as well, and the Australian team was third. Thus, the Australians claimed that the Brazilian result should have been canceled, given the previous – although then unknown — positive doping result of an athlete of the Brazilian team. This would have removed the Brazilian team from the Olympics and awarded Australia the spot, as the second valid result from the qualification event (New Zealand would have moved to first place). On 19 February, the IOC ruled in favor of the Brazilians, rejecting the motion from the Australian Olympic Committee.Run 1 – In their first run, the Brazilians' sleigh turned over coming out of Curve 14, after an error by pilot Ricardo Raschini, causing the team to finish with an exceedingly slow time. After an initial scare, the Brazilians got out of the sleigh and decided to continue in competition. No one was hurt and their sleigh was not damaged, but they had to borrow a helmet from the German team, since one of the Brazilians' was badly damaged during the accident.Run 3 – In what looked like a replay of Heat 1, the Brazilians once again turned over in Curve 14. Once again, pilot Ricardo Raschini miscalculated his exit of this curve, causing the sleigh to turn over. This time, the accident was slightly more violent than the original one: the sleigh was completely upside down for a few seconds, and pusher Claudinei Quirino got out of the sleigh complaining of pain in one of his arms, being taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital for detailed exams. He was released soon after, having been only medicated for the pain.The event finished any faint possibility that the Brazilians could qualify for Heat 4, of which only the top 20 sleighs would participate. In an interview soon afterwards, Raschini took full responsibility for both the accidents, asking for 'the forgiveness of his team and the Brazilian people', although reporting that insufficient training at the Olympic track was the main cause of his inability to master Curve 14. His teammates and Brazilian officials, however, were quick to show Raschini their full support, saying that no one is to blame for a competition mishappening and that they are already looking forward to Vancouver 2010. Edson Bindilatti, the brakeman, closed his statement vowing that 'the Frozen Bananas' shall return 'in style'.On another aspect of the last participation of the Brazilian team, they were able to secure a replacement helmet for second man Márcio Silva (he had had to borrow a German helmet the day before, for lack of a spare unit), having had it flown in from the United States, where the manufacturer is located.Cross-country skiingDistanceSnowboardingIsabel Clark Ribeiro qualified for the knockout rounds in the women's snowboard cross with the 5th fastest time, but a third-place finish in her quarterfinal left her battling for 9th place.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Track and field\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Track and field is a sport that includes athletic contests based on running, jumping, and throwing skills. The name is derived from where the sport takes place, a running track and a grass field for the throwing and some of the jumping events. Track and field is categorized under the umbrella sport of athletics, which also includes road running, cross country running, and racewalking.The foot racing events, which include sprints, middle- and long-distance events, racewalking, and hurdling, are won by the athlete who completes it in the least time. The jumping and throwing events are won by those who achieve the greatest distance or height. Regular jumping events include long jump, triple jump, high jump, and pole vault, while the most common throwing events are shot put, javelin, discus, and hammer. There are also 'combined events' or 'multi events', such as the pentathlon consisting of five events, heptathlon consisting of seven events, and decathlon consisting of ten events. In these, athletes participate in a combination of track and field events. Most track and field events are individual sports with a single victor; the most prominent team events are relay races, which typically feature teams of four. Events are almost exclusively divided by gender, although both the men's and women's competitions are usually held at the same venue. Recently, “mixed” relay events have been introduced into meets, whereby two men and two women make up the four-person team. If a race has too many people to run all at once, preliminary heats will be run to narrow down the field of participants.Track and field is one of the oldest sports. In ancient times, it was an event held in conjunction with festivals and sports meets such as the Ancient Olympic Games in Greece. In modern times, the two most prestigious international track and field competitions are the athletics competition at the Olympic Games and the World Athletics Championships. World Athletics, formerly known as the International Association of Athletics Federations, is the international governing body for the sport of athletics.Records are kept of the best performances in specific events, at world, continental, and national levels, right down to a personal level. However, if athletes are deemed to have violated the event's rules or regulations, they are disqualified from the competition and their marks are erased.In the United States, the term track and field may refer to other athletics events, such as cross country, the marathon, and road running, rather than strictly track-based events.HistoryThe sport of track and field has its roots in human prehistory. Track and field style events are among the oldest of all sporting competitions, as running, jumping and throwing are natural and universal forms of human physical expression. The first recorded examples of organized track and field events at a sports festival are the Ancient Olympic Games. At the first Games in 776 BC in Olympia, Greece, only one event was contested: the stadion footrace. The scope of the Games expanded in later years to include further running competitions, but the introduction of the Ancient Olympic pentathlon marked a step towards track and field as it is recognized today—it comprised a five-event competition of the long jump, javelin throw, discus throw, stadion footrace, and wrestling.Track and field events were also present at the Panhellenic Games in Greece around this period, and they spread to Rome in Italy around 200 BC. After the period of Classical antiquity (in which the sport was largely Greco-Roman influenced) new track and field events began developing in parts of Northern Europe in the Middle Ages. The stone put and weight throw competitions popular among Celtic societies in Ireland and Scotland were precursors to the modern shot put and hammer throw events. One of the last track and field events to develop was the pole vault, which stemmed from competitions such as the Fierljeppen contests in the Northern European Lowlands in the 18th century.Discrete modern track and field competitions, separate from general sporting festivals, were first recorded in the 19th century. These were typically organised by educational institutions, military organisations and sports clubs as competitions between rival establishments. Competitions in the English public schools were conceived as human equivalents of horse racing, fox hunting and hare coursing, influenced by a Classics-rich curriculum. The Royal Shrewsbury School Hunt is the oldest running club in the world, with written records going back to 1831 and evidence that it was established by 1819. The school organised Paper Chase races in which runners followed a trail of paper shreds left by two 'foxes'; even today RSSH runners are called 'hounds' and a race victory is a 'kill'. The first definite record of Shrewsbury's (cross-country) Annual Steeplechase is in 1834, making it the oldest running race of the modern era. The school also lays claim to the oldest track and field meeting still in existence, originating in the Second Spring Meeting first documented in 1840. This featured a series of throwing and jumping events with mock horse races including the Derby Stakes, the Hurdle Race and the Trial Stakes. Runners were entered by 'owners' and named as though they were horses.away and a decade later, the first Wenlock Olympian Games were held at Much Wenlock racecourse. Events at the 1851 Wenlock Games included a 'half-mile foot race' (805 m) and a 'leaping in distance' competition.In 1865, Dr William Penny Brookes of Wenlock helped set up the National Olympian Association, which held their first Olympian Games in 1866 at The Crystal Palace in London. This national event was a great success, attracting a crowd of over ten thousand people.In response, that same year the Amateur Athletic Club was formed and held a championship for 'gentlemen amateurs' in an attempt to reclaim the sport for the educated elite. Ultimately the 'allcomers' ethos of the NOA won through and the AAC was reconstituted as the Amateur Athletic Association in 1880, the first national body for the sport of athletics. The AAA Championships, the de facto British national championships despite being for England only, have been held annually since 3 July 1880 with breaks only during two world wars and 2006–2008. The AAA was effectively a global governing body in the early years of the sport, codifying its rules for the first time.Meanwhile, the United States began holding an annual national competition—the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships—first held in 1876 by the New York Athletic Club. The establishment of general sports governing bodies for the United States (the Amateur Athletic Union in 1888) and France (the Union des sociétés françaises de sports athlétiques in 1889) put the sport on a formal footing and meant that international competitions became possible.The establishment of the modern Olympic Games at the end of the 19th century marked a new high for track and field. The Olympic athletics programme, comprising track and field events plus a marathon race, contained many of the foremost sporting competitions of the 1896 Summer Olympics. The Olympics also consolidated the use of metric measurements in international track and field events, both for race distances and for measuring jumps and throws. The Olympic athletics programme greatly expanded over the next decades, and track and field contests remained among the Games' most prominent. The Olympics was the elite competition for track and field, and only amateur sportsmen could compete. Track and field continued to be a largely amateur sport, as this rule was strictly enforced: Jim Thorpe was stripped of his track and field medals from the 1912 Olympics after it was revealed that he had taken expense money for playing baseball, violating Olympic amateurism rules, before the 1912 Games. His medals were reinstated 29 years after his death.That same year, the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) was established, becoming the international governing body for track and field, and it enshrined amateurism as one of its founding principles for the sport. The National Collegiate Athletic Association held their first Men's Outdoor Track and Field Championship in 1921, making it one of the most prestigious competitions for students, and this was soon followed by the introduction of track and field at the inaugural World Student Games in 1923. The first continental track and field competition was the 1919 South American Championships, which was followed by the European Athletics Championships in 1934.Up until the early 1920s, track and field had been almost exclusively a male-only pursuit. Alice Milliat argued for the inclusion of women at the Olympics, but the International Olympic Committee refused. She founded the International Women's Sports Federation in 1921 and, alongside a growing women's sports movement in Europe and North America, the group initiated of the Women's Olympiad (held annually from 1921 to 1923). Working in conjunction with the English Women's Amateur Athletic Association (WAAA), the Women's World Games was held four times between 1922 and 1934, as well as a Women's International and British Games in London in 1924. These events ultimately led to the introduction of five track and field events for women in the athletics at the 1928 Summer Olympics. In China, women's track and field events were being held in the 1920s, but were subject to criticism and disrespect from audiences. National women's events were established in this period, with 1923 seeing the First British TrackField championships for women and the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) sponsoring the First American TrackField championships for women. Also in 1923, physical education advocate Zhang Ruizhen called for greater equality and participation of women in Chinese track and field. The rise of Kinue Hitomi and her 1928 Olympic medal for Japan signified the growth of women's track and field in East Asia. More women's events were gradually introduced as years progressed (although it was only towards the end of the century that the men's and women's programmes approached parity of events). Marking an increasingly inclusive approach to the sport, major track and field competitions for disabled athletes were first introduced at the 1960 Summer Paralympics.With the rise of numerous regional championships, as well as the growth in Olympic-style multi-sport events (such as the Commonwealth Games and the Pan-American Games), competitions between international track and field athletes became widespread. From the 1960s onwards, the sport gained more exposure and commercial appeal through television coverage and the increasing wealth of nations. After over half a century of amateurism, the amateur status of the sport began to be displaced by growing professionalism in the late 1970s. As a result, the Amateur Athletic Union was dissolved in the United States and it was replaced with a non-amateur body solely focused on the sport of athletics: The Athletics Congress (later USA Track and Field). The IAAF abandoned amateurism in 1982 and later removed all references to it from its name by rebranding itself as the International Association of Athletics Federations. While Western countries were limited to amateurs until the early 1980s, Soviet Bloc countries always fielded state-funded athletes who trained full-time, putting American and Western European athletes at a significant disadvantage. 1983 saw the establishment of the IAAF World Championships in Athletics—the first-ever global competition just for athletics—which, with the Olympics, became one of track and field's most prestigious competitions.The profile of the sport reached a new high in the 1980s, with a number of athletes becoming household names (such as Carl Lewis, Sergey Bubka, Sebastian Coe, Zola Budd and Florence Griffith Joyner). Many world records were broken in this period, and the added political element between competitors of the United States, East Germany, and the Soviet Union, in reaction to the Cold War, only served to stoke the sport's popularity. The increase in the commercial capacity of track and field was also met with developments in the application of sports science, and there were many changes to coaching methods, athlete's diet regimes, training facilities, and sports equipment. This was also accompanied by an increase in the use of performance-enhancing drugs. State-sponsored doping in 1970s and 1980s East Germany, China, the Soviet Union, and early 21st century Russia, as well as prominent individual cases such as those of Olympic gold medallists Ben Johnson and Marion Jones, damaged the public image and marketability of the sport.From the 1990s onwards, track and field became increasingly more professional and international, as the IAAF gained over two hundred member nations. The IAAF World Championships in Athletics became a fully professional competition with the introduction of prize money in 1997, and in 1998 the IAAF Golden League—an annual series of major track and field meetings in Europe—provided a higher level of economic incentive in the form of a US1 million jackpot. In 2010, the series was replaced by the more lucrative IAAF Diamond League, a fourteen-meeting series held in Europe, Asia, North America, and the Middle East—the first-ever worldwide annual series of track and field meetings.EventsTrack and field events are divided into three broad categories: track events, field events, and combined events. The majority of athletes tend to specialize in just one event (or event type) with the aim of perfecting their performances, although the aim of combined events athletes is to become proficient in a number of disciplines. Track events involve running on a track over specified distances, and—in the case of the hurdling and steeplechase events—obstacles may be placed on the track. There are also relay races in which teams of athletes run and pass on a baton to their team members at the end of a certain distance.There are two types of field events: jumps and throws. In jumping competitions, athletes are judged on either the length or height of their jumps. The performances of jumping events for distance are measured from a board or marker, and any athlete overstepping this mark is judged to have fouled. In the jumps for height, an athlete must clear their body over a crossbar without knocking the bar off the supporting standards. The majority of jumping events are unaided, although athletes propel themselves vertically with purpose-built sticks in the pole vault.The throwing events involve hurling an implement (such as a heavyweight, javelin, or discus) from a set point, with athletes being judged on the distance that the object is thrown. Combined events involve the same group of athletes contesting a number of different track and field events. Points are given for their performance in each event and the athlete and/or team with the greatest points total at the end of all events is the winner.TrackSprintsRaces over short distances, or sprints, are among the oldest running competitions. The first 13 editions of the Ancient Olympic Games featured only one event, the stadion race, which was a race from one end of the stadium to the other. Sprinting events are focused on athletes reaching and sustaining their quickest possible running speed. Three sprinting events are currently held at the Olympics and outdoor World Championships: the 100 metres, 200 metres, and 400 metres. These events have their roots in races of imperial measurements that later changed to metric: the 100 m evolved from the 100-yard dash, the 200 m distances came from the furlong (or 1/8 of a mile), and the 400 m was the successor to the 440 yard dash or quarter-mile race.At the professional level, sprinters begin the race by assuming a crouching position in the starting blocks before leaning forward and gradually moving into an upright position as the race progresses and momentum is gained. Athletes remain in the same lane on the running track throughout all sprinting events, with the sole exception of the 400 m indoors. Races up to 100 m are largely focused upon acceleration to an athlete's maximum speed. All sprints beyond this distance increasingly incorporate an element of endurance. Human physiology dictates that a runner's near-top speed cannot be maintained for more than thirty seconds or so because lactic acid builds up once leg muscles begin to suffer oxygen deprivation.Top speed can only be maintained for up to 20 metres.The 60 metres is a common indoor event and indoor world championship event. Less-common events include the 50 metres, 55 metres, 300 metres, and 500 metres, which are run in some high school and collegiate competitions in the United States. The 150 metres, though rarely competed, has a star-studded history: Pietro Mennea set a world best in 1983, Olympic champions Michael Johnson and Donovan Bailey went head-to-head over the distance in 1997, and Usain Bolt improved Mennea's record in 2009.Middle distanceThe most common middle-distance track events are the 800 metres, 1500 metres and mile run, although the 3000 metres may also be classified as a middle-distance event. The 880 yard run, or half mile, was the forebear of the 800 m distance and it has its roots in competitions in the United Kingdom in the 1830s. The 1500 m came about as a result of running three laps of a 500 m track, which was commonplace in continental Europe in the 20th century.Runners start the race from a standing position along a curved starting line and after hearing the starting pistol they head towards the innermost track to follow the quickest route to the finish. In 800 m races athletes begin at a staggered starting point before the turn in the track and they must remain in their lanes for the first 100 m of the race. This rule was introduced to reduce the amount of physical jostling between runners in the early stages of the race. Physiologically, these middle-distance events demand that athletes have good aerobic and anaerobic energy producing systems, and also that they have strong speed endurance.The 1500 m and mile run events have historically been some of the most prestigious track and field events. Swedish rivals Gunder Hägg and Arne Andersson broke each other's 1500 m and mile world records on a number of occasions in the 1940s. The prominence of the distances were maintained by Roger Bannister, who (in 1954) was the first to run the long-elusive four-minute mile, and Jim Ryun's exploits served to popularise interval training. Races between British rivals Sebastian Coe, Steve Ovett and Steve Cram characterised middle-distance running in the 1980s. From the 1990s onwards, North Africans such as Noureddine Morceli of Algeria and Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco came to dominate the 1500 and mile events.Beyond the short distances of sprinting events, factors such as an athlete's reactions and top speed becomes less important, while qualities such as pace, race tactics and endurance become more so.Long-distanceThere are three common long-distance running events in track and field competitions: 3000 metres, 5000 metres and 10,000 metres. The latter two races are both Olympic and World Championship events outdoors, while the 3000 m is held at the IAAF World Indoor Championships. The 5000 m and 10,000 m events have their historical roots in the 3-mile and 6-mile races. The 3000 m was historically used as a women's long-distance event, entering the World Championship programme in 1983 and Olympic programme in 1984, but this was abandoned in favour of a women's 5000 m event in 1995.Marathons, while long-distance races, are typically run on street courses, and often are run separately from other track and field events.In terms of competition rules and physical demands, long-distance track races have much in common with middle-distance races, except that pacing, stamina, and race tactics become much greater factors in performances. However, a number of athletes have achieved success in both middle- and long-distance events, including Saïd Aouita who set world records from 1500 m to 5000 m. The use of pace-setters in long-distance events is very common at the elite level, although they are not present at championship level competitions as all qualified competitors want to win.The long-distance track events gained popularity in the 1920s by the achievements of the 'Flying Finns', such as multiple Olympic champion Paavo Nurmi. The successes of Emil Zátopek in the 1950s promoted intense interval training methods, but Ron Clarke's world record-breaking feats established the importance of natural training and even-paced running. The 1990s saw the rise of North and East African runners in long-distance events. Kenyan and Ethiopian athletes, in particular, have since remained dominant in these events.Relay racesRelay races are the only track and field event in which a team of runners directly compete against other teams. Typically, a team is made up of four runners of the same sex. Each runner completes their specified distance (referred to as a leg) before handing over a baton to a teammate, who then begins their leg upon receiving the baton. There is usually a designated area where athletes must exchange the baton. Teams may be disqualified if they fail to complete the change within the area, or if the baton is dropped during the race. A team may also be disqualified if its runners are deemed to have wilfully impeded other competitors.Relay races emerged in the United States in the 1880s as a variation on charity races between firemen, who would hand a red pennant on to teammates every 300 yards. There are two very common relay events: the 4×100 metres relay and the 4×400 metres relay. Both events entered the Olympic programme at the 1912 Summer Games after a one-off men's medley relay featured in 1908 Olympics. The 4 × 100 m event is run strictly within the same lane on the track, meaning that the team collectively runs one complete circuit of the track. Teams in a 4 × 400 m event remain in their own lane until the runner of the second leg passes the first bend, at which point runners can leave their lanes and head towards the inner-most part of the circuit. For the second and third baton change overs, teammates must align themselves in respect of their team position – leading teams take the inner lanes while teammates of the slower teams must await the baton on outer lanes.The Shuttle Hurdle Relay per Hurdling web page: In a shuttle hurdle relay, each of four hurdlers on a team runs the opposite direction from the preceding runner. No batons are used for this particular relay.The IAAF keeps world records for five different types of track relays. As with 4×100 m and 4×400 m events, all races comprise teams of four athletes running the same distances, with the less commonly contested distances being the 4×200 m, 4×800 m and 4×1500 m relays. Other events include the distance medley relay (comprising legs of 1200 m, 400 m, 800 m, and 1600 m), which is frequently held in the United States, and a sprint relay, known as the Swedish medley relay, which is popular in Scandinavia and was held at the IAAF World Youth Championships in Athletics programme. Relay events have significant participation in the United States, where a number of large meetings (or relay carnivals) are focused almost exclusively on relay events.HurdlingRaces with hurdles as obstacles were first popularised in the 19th century in England. The first known event, held in 1830, was a variation of the 100-yard dash that included heavy wooden barriers as obstacles. A competition between the Oxford and Cambridge Athletic Clubs in 1864 refined this, holding a 120-yard race (110 m) with ten hurdles of 3-foot and 6 inches (1.06 m) in height (each placed 10 yards (9 m) apart), with the first and final hurdles 15 yards from the start and finish, respectively. French organisers adapted the race into metric (adding 28 cm) and the basics of this race, the men's 110 metres hurdles, has remained largely unchanged. The origin of the 400 metres hurdles also lies in Oxford, where (around 1860) a competition was held over 440 yards and twelve 1.06 m high wooden barriers were placed along the course. The modern regulations stem from the 1900 Summer Olympics: the distance was fixed to 400 m while ten 3-foot (91.44 cm) hurdles were placed 35 m apart on the track, with the first and final hurdles being 45 m and 40 m away from the start and finish, respectively. Women's hurdles are slightly lower at 84 cm (2 ft 9 in) for the 100 m event and 76 cm (2 ft 6 in) for the 400 m event.By far the most common events are the 100 metres hurdles for women, 110 m hurdles for men and 400 m hurdles for both sexes. The men's 110 m has been featured at every modern Summer Olympics while the men's 400 m was introduced in the second edition of the Games. Women's initially competed in the 80 metres hurdles event, which entered the Olympic programme in 1932. This was extended to the 100 m hurdles at the 1972 Olympics, but it was not until 1984 that a women's 400 m hurdles event took place at the Olympics (having been introduced at the 1983 World Championships in Athletics the previous year).Other distances and heights of hurdles, such as the 200 metres hurdles and low hurdles, were once common but are now held infrequently.The 300 metres hurdles is run in some levels of American competition.Outside of the hurdles events, the steeplechase race is the other track and field event with obstacles. Just as the hurdling events, the steeplechase finds its origin in student competition in Oxford, England. However, this event was born as a human variation on the original steeplechase competition found in horse racing. A steeplechase event was held on a track for the 1879 English championships and the 1900 Summer Olympics featured men's 2500 m and 4000 m steeplechase races. The event was held over various distances until the 1920 Summer Olympics marked the rise of the 3000 metres steeplechase as the standard event. The IAAF set the standards of the event in 1954, and the event is held on a 400 m circuit that includes a water jump on each lap. Despite the long history of men's steeplechase in track and field, the women's steeplechase only gained World Championship status in 2005, with its first Olympic appearance in 2008.FieldJumpingLong jumpThe long jump is one of the oldest track and field events, having its roots as one of the events within the ancient Greek pentathlon contest. The athletes would take a short run up and jump into an area of dug up earth, with the winner being the one who jumped farthest. Small weights (Halteres) were held in each hand during the jump then swung back and dropped near the end to gain extra momentum and distance. The modern long jump, standardised in England and the United States around 1860, bears resemblance to the ancient event although no weights are used. Athletes sprint along a length of track that leads to a jumping board and a sandpit. The athletes must jump before a marked line and their achieved distance is measured from the nearest point of sand disturbed by the athlete's body.The athletics competition at the first Olympics featured a men's long jump competition and a women's competition was introduced at the 1948 Summer Olympics. Professional long jumpers typically have strong acceleration and sprinting abilities. However, athletes must also have a consistent stride to allow them to take off near the board while still maintaining their maximum speed. In addition to the traditional long jump, a standing long jump contest exists which requires that athletes leap from a static position without a run-up. A men's version of this event featured on the Olympic programme from 1900 to 1912.Triple jumpSimilar to the long jump, the triple jump takes place on a track heading towards a sandpit. Originally, athletes would hop on the same leg twice before jumping into the pit, but this was changed to the current 'hop, step and jump' pattern from 1900 onwards. There is some dispute over whether the triple jump was contested in ancient Greece: while some historians claim that a contest of three jumps occurred at Ancient Games, others such as Stephen G. Miller believe this is incorrect, suggesting that the belief stems from a mythologised account of Phayllus of Croton having jumped 55 ancient feet (around 16.3 m). The Book of Leinster, a 12th-century Irish manuscript, records the existence of geal-ruith (triple jump) contests at the Tailteann Games.The men's triple jump competition has been ever-present at the modern Olympics, but it was not until 1993 that a women's version gained World Championship status and went on to have its first Olympic appearance three years later. The men's standing triple jump event featured at the Olympics in 1900 and 1904, but such competitions have since become very uncommon, although it is still used as a non-competitive exercise drill. The Current world record for the Men's triple jump is 18.29 meter (60 ft 0in) held by Jonathan Edwards. The current women's world record is 15.67 meters (51 ft 4 3/4in) held by Yulimar Rojas.High jumpThe first recorded instances of high jumping competitions were in Scotland in the 19th century. Further competitions were organised in 1840 in England and in 1865 the basic rules of the modern event were standardised there. Athletes have a short run up and then take off from one foot to jump over a horizontal bar and fall back onto a cushioned landing area. The men's high jump was included in the 1896 Olympics and a women's competition followed in 1928.Jumping technique has played a significant part in the history of the event. High jumpers typically cleared the bar feet first in the late 19th century, using either the Scissors, Eastern cut-off or Western roll technique. The straddle technique became prominent in the mid-20th century, but Dick Fosbury overturned tradition by pioneering a backwards and head-first technique in the late 1960s – the Fosbury Flop – which won him the gold at the 1968 Olympics. This technique has become the overwhelming standard for the sport from the 1980s onwards. The standing high jump was contested at the Olympics from 1900 to 1912, but is now relatively uncommon outside of its use as an exercise drill.Pole vaultIn terms of sport, the use of poles for vaulting distances was recorded in Fierljeppen contests in the Frisian area of Europe, and vaulting for height was seen at gymnastics competitions in Germany in the 1770s. One of the earliest recorded pole vault competitions was in Cumbria, England in 1843. The basic rules and technique of the event originated in the United States. The rules required that athletes do not move their hands along the pole and athletes began clearing the bar with their feet first and twisting so that the stomach faces the bar. Bamboo poles were introduced in the 20th century and a metal box in the runway for planting the pole became standard. Landing mattresses were introduced in the mid-20th century to protect the athletes who were clearing increasingly greater heights.The modern event sees athletes run down a strip of track, plant the pole in the metal box, and vault over the horizontal bar before letting go of the pole and falling backwards onto the landing mattress. While earlier versions used wooden, metal or bamboo, modern poles are generally made from artificial materials such as fibreglass or carbon fibre. The pole vault has been an Olympic event since 1896 for men, but it was over 100 years later that the first women's world championship competition was held at the 1997 IAAF World Indoor Championships. The first women's Olympic pole vaulting competition occurred in 2000.Throwing Track and field contains some of the foremost kinds of throwing sports, and the four major disciplines are the only pure throwing events to feature at the Olympic Games.Shot putThe genesis of the shot put can be traced to pre-historic competitions with rocks: in the Middle ages the stone put was known in Scotland and the steinstossen was recorded in Switzerland. In the 17th century, cannonball throwing competitions within the English military provided a precursor to the modern sport. The term 'shot' originates from the use of round shot-style ammunition for the sport. The modern rules were first laid out in 1860 and required that competitors take legal throws within a square throwing area of seven feet (2.13 m) on each side. This was amended to a circle area with a seven-foot diameter in 1906, and the weight of the shot was standardised to 16 pounds (7.26 kg). Throwing technique was also refined over this period, with bent arm throws being banned as they were deemed too dangerous and the side-step and throw technique arising in the United States in 1876.The shot put has been an Olympic sport for men since 1896 and a women's competition using a 4 kg (8.82 lb) shot was added in 1948. Further throwing techniques have arisen since the post-war era: in the 1950s Parry O'Brien popularised the 180 degree turn and throw technique commonly known as the 'glide', breaking the world record 17 times along the way, while Aleksandr Baryshnikov and Brian Oldfield introduced the 'spin' or rotational technique in 1976.Discus throwIn the discus throw, athletes compete to throw a heavy disc the farthest. In standard competitions, athletes throw the disc from a set circular arc and take turns in a series of throw, with the singular best effort deciding the victor. As one of the events within the ancient pentathlon, the history of the discus throw dates back to 708 BC. In ancient times a heavy circular disc was thrown from a set standing position on a small pedestal, and it was this style that was revived for the 1896 Olympics. This continued until the 1906 Intercalated Games in Athens, which featured both the ancient style and the increasingly popular modern style of turning and throwing. By the 1912 Olympics, the ancient standing throw style had fallen into disuse and contests starting within a 2.5 m squared throwing area became the standard. The discus implement was standardised to 2 kg (4.4 pounds) in weight and 22 cm (8 inches) in diameter in 1907. The women's discus was among the first women's events on the Olympic programme, being introduced in 1928. The first modern athlete to throw the discus while rotating the whole body was Czech athlete František Janda-Suk, who invented the technique when studying the position of the famous statue of Discobolus and won the 1900 Olympic silver medal.Javelin throwAs an implement of war and hunting, javelin throwing began in prehistoric times. Along with the discus, the javelin was the second throwing event in the ancient Olympic pentathlon. Records from 708 BC show two javelin competition types co-existing: throwing at a target and throwing the javelin for distance. It was the latter type from which the modern event derives. In ancient competitions, athletes would wrap an ankyle (thin leather strip) around the javelin that acted as a sling to facilitate extra distance. The javelin throw gained much popularity in Scandinavia in the late 19th century and athletes from the region are still among the most dominant throwers in men's competitions. The modern event features a short run up on a track and then the thrower releases the javelin before the foul line. The runway measures at a minimum of 30m in length, and is covered with the same surface as the track.The first Olympic men's javelin throw contest was held in 1908 and a women's competition was introduced in 1932. The first javelins were made of various types of wood, but in the 1950s, former athlete Bud Held introduced a hollow javelin, then a metal javelin, both of which increased throwers performances. Another former athlete, Miklós Németh invented the rough-tailed javelin and throws reached in excess of 100 m – edging towards the limits of stadia. The distances and the increasing number of horizontal landings led the IAAF to redesign the men's javelin to reduce distance and increase the implement's downward pitching moment to allow for easier measurement. Rough-tailed designs were banned in 1991 and all marks achieved with such javelins were removed from the record books. The women's javelin underwent a similar redesign in 1999. The current javelin specifications are 2.6 to 2.7 m in length and 800 grams in weight for men, and 2.2 to 2.3 m and 600 g for women.Hammer throwThe earliest recorded precursors to the modern hammer throw stem from the Tailteann Games of ancient Ireland, which featured events such as throwing either a weight attached to a rope, a large rock on a wooden handle, or even a chariot wheel on a wooden axle. Other ancient competitions included throwing a cast iron ball attached to a wooden handle – the root of the term 'hammer throw' due to their resemblance to the tools. In 16th century England, contests involving the throwing of actual blacksmith's Sledgehammers were recorded. The hammer implement was standardised in 1887 and the competitions began to resemble the modern event. The weight of the metal ball was set at 16 pounds (7.26 kg) while the attached wire had to measure between 1.175 m and 1.215 m.The men's hammer throw became an Olympic event in 1900 but the women's event – using a 4 kg (8.82 lb) weight – was not widely competed until much later, finally featuring on the women's Olympic programme in 2000. The distances thrown by male athletes became greater from the 1950s onwards as a result of improved equipment using the denser metals, a switch to concrete throwing areas, and more advanced training techniques. Professional hammer throwers were historically large, strong, sturdy athletes. However, qualities such as refined technique, speed and flexibility have become increasingly important in the modern era as the legal throwing area has been reduced from 90 to 34.92 degrees and throwing technique involves three to four controlled rotations.Combined eventsCombined (or multi-discipline) events are competitions in which athletes participate in a number of track and field events, earning points for their performance in each event, which adds to a total points score. Outdoors, the most common combined events are the men's decathlon (ten events) and the women's heptathlon (seven events). Due to stadium limitations, indoor combined events competition have a reduced number of events, resulting in the men's heptathlon and the women's pentathlon. Athletes are allocated points based on an international-standard points scoring system, such as the decathlon scoring table.The Ancient Olympic pentathlon (comprising long jump, javelin, discus, the stadion race and wrestling) was a precursor to the track and field combined events and this ancient event was restored at the 1906 Summer Olympics (Intercalated Games). A men's all-around was held at the 1904 Summer Olympics, contested between five American and two British athletes.StadiumsOutdoorThe term track and field is intertwined with the stadiums that first hosted such competitions. The two basic features of a track and field stadium are the outer oval-shaped running track and an area of turf within this track—the field. In earlier competitions, track lengths varied: the Panathinaiko Stadium measured 333.33 metres at the 1896 Summer Olympics, while at the 1904 Olympics the distance was a third of a mile (536.45 m) at Francis Field. As the sport developed, the IAAF standardised the length to 400 m and stated that the tracks must be split into six to eight running lanes. Precise widths for the lanes were established, as were regulations regarding the curvature of the track. Tracks made of flattened cinders were popular in the early 20th century but synthetic tracks became standard in the late 1960s. 3M's Tartan track (an all-weather running track of polyurethane) gained popularity after its use at the 1968 US Olympic Trials and the 1968 Summer Olympics and it began the process in which synthetic tracks became the standard for the sport. Many track and field stadiums are multi-purpose stadiums, with the running track surrounding a field built for other sports, such as the various types of football.The field of the stadium combines a number of elements for use in the jumping and throwing events. The long jump and triple jump areas comprise a straight, narrow 40-metre running track with a sandpit at one or both ends. Jumps are measured from a take off board—typically a small strip of wood with a plasticine marker attached—which ensures athletes jump from behind the measurement line. The pole vault area is also a 40-metre running track and has an indentation in the ground (the box) where vaulters plant their poles to propel themselves over a crossbar before falling onto cushioned landing mats. The high jump is a stripped-down version of this, with an open area of track or field that leads to a crossbar with a square area of landing mats behind it.The four throwing events generally all begin on one side of the stadium. The javelin throw typically takes place on a piece of track that is central and parallel to the straights of the main running track. The javelin throwing area is a sector shape frequently across the Pitch (sports field) in the middle of the stadium, ensuring that the javelin has a minimal chance of causing damage or injury. The discus throw and hammer throw contests begin in a tall metal cage usually situated in one of the corners of the field. The cage reduces the danger of implements being thrown out of the field of play and throws travel diagonally across the field in the centre of the stadium. The shot put features a circular throwing area with a toe board at one end. The throwing area is a sector. Some stadia also have a water jump area on one side of the field specifically for steeplechase races.Indoor Basic indoor venues may be adapted gymnasiums, which can easily accommodate high jump competitions and short track events. Full-size indoor arenas (i.e. those fully equipped to host all events for the World Indoor Championships) bear similarities with their outdoor equivalents. Typically, a central area is surrounded by a 200-metre oval track with four to eight lanes. The track can be banked at the turns to allow athletes to run around the radius more comfortably. Some have a second running track going straight across the field area, parallel to the straights of the main circuit. This track is used for the 60 metres and 60 metres hurdles events, which are held almost exclusively indoors.Another common adaptation in the United States is a 160-yard track (11 laps to a mile) that fits into a common basketball court-sized arena. This was quite popular when races were held at imperial distances, which gradually was phased out by different organizations in the 1970s and 1980s. Examples of this configuration include the Millrose Games at Madison Square Garden, and the Sunkist Invitational formerly held in the Los Angeles Sports Arena.All four of the common jumping events are held at indoor venues. The long and triple jump areas run alongside the central 60 m track and are mostly identical in form to their outdoor counterparts. The pole vault track and landing area are also alongside the central running track. Shot put and weight throw are the only throwing events held indoors due to size restrictions. The throwing area is similar to the outdoor event, but the landing sector is a rectangular section surrounded by netting or a stop barrier.In addition to hosting the World Indoor Championships, the IAAF has hosted the IAAF World Indoor Tour since 2016.Starts use in raceTrack rules The rules of track events in athletics as observed in most international athletics competitions are set by the Competition Rules of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). The most recent complete set of rules is the 2009 rules that relate only to competitions in 2009. Key rules of track events are those regarding starting, running and finishing. Current World Athletics (WA) Rules are available on WA's website . Current USATF (USA) Competition Rules booklet is available on the USATF website . Prior USATF Competition Rules booklets are also available (2002, 2006 to 2020) .StartingThe start of a race is marked by a white line 5 cm wide. In all races that are not run in lanes the start line must be curved, so that all the athletes start the same distance from the finish. Starting blocks may be used for all races up to and including 400 m (including the first leg of the 4 × 100 m and 4 × 400 m) and may not be used for any other race. No part of the starting block may overlap the start line or extend into another lane.All races must be started by the report of the starter's gun or approved starting apparatus fired upwards after they have ascertained that athletes are steady and in the correct starting position. An athlete may not touch either the start line or the ground in front of it with their hands or feet when on their marks.For sprint races up to 400 m, the starter gives two commands: 'on your marks' to instruct athletes to approach the start line, followed by 'set' to advise the athletes that the start of the race is imminent. The commands of the starter are typically given in the native language in national competitions, or in English or French in international competitions. Once all athletes are set in their starting position, the gun or an approved starting apparatus must be fired or activated. If the starter is not satisfied that all are ready to proceed, the athletes may be called out of the blocks and the process started over.There are different types of starts for races of different distances. Middle- and long-distance races mainly use the waterfall start. This is when all athletes begin on a curved line that moves farther out at the outer edge of the track. Competitors are allowed to move towards the inside lane right away, as long as it is safe to do so. For some middle-distance races, such as 800 m, each athlete starts in their own lane. Once the gun fires, they must run in the lane they began in until markers on the track notify them it is time to move towards the inside lane. For sprint races, athletes begin in start blocks and must stay in their own lane for the entire race.An athlete, after assuming a final set position, may not commence his starting motion until after receiving the report of the gun, or approved starting apparatus. If, in the judgment of the starter or recallers, he does so any earlier, it is considered a false start. It is deemed a false start if, in the judgment of the starter an athlete fails to comply with the commands 'on your marks' or 'set' as appropriate after a reasonable time; or an athlete after the command 'on your marks' disturbs other athletes in the race through sound or otherwise. If the runner is in the 'set' position and moves, then the runner is also disqualified. , any athlete making a false start is disqualified.In International elite competition, electronically tethered starting blocks sense the reaction time of the athletes. If the athlete reacts in less than 0.1 second, an alert sounds for a recall starter and the offending athlete is guilty of a false start. Since 2009, the offending athletes are immediately disqualified.Running the raceFor sprinting events (bar the 4 × 400 m relay and the indoor 400 metres), each athlete must run the race within their allocated lane from start to finish. If an athlete leaves their lane or steps on the line demarking each lane the athlete will be disqualified. Lane rules also apply for initial periods of other track races, for example, the beginning of the 800 m. Similar rules apply for longer distance races when a large field of athletes is present and separate starting points are designated, with the field merging into one group shortly after the starting phase.Any athlete who jostles or obstructs another athlete, in a way that impedes his progress, should be disqualified from that event. However, if an athlete is pushed or forced by another person to run outside his lane, and if no material advantage is gained, the athlete should not be disqualified.The finish The finish of a race is marked by a white line 5 cm wide. The finishing position of athletes is determined by the order in which any part of their torso (as distinguished from the head, neck, arms, legs, hands or feet) reaches the vertical plane of the nearer edge of the finish line. Fully automatic timing systems (photo timing) are becoming more and more common at increasingly lower levels of track meets, improving the accuracy, while eliminating the need for eagle-eyed officials on the finish line. Fully automatic timing (FAT) is required for high level meets and any time a sprint record is set (though distance records can be accepted if timed by three independent stopwatches).With the accuracy of the timing systems, ties are rare. Ties between different athletes are resolved as follows: In determining whether there has been a tie in any round for a qualifying position for the next round based on time, a judge (called the chief photo finish judge) must consider the actual time recorded by the athletes to one thousandth of a second. If the judge decides that there has been a tie, the tying athletes must be placed in the next round or, if that is not practicable, lots must be drawn to determine who must be placed in the next round. In the case of a tie for first place in any final, the referee decides whether it is practicable to arrange for the athletes so tying to compete again. If he decides it is not, the result stands. Ties in other placings remain.Field rules In general, most field events allow a competitor to take their attempt individually, under theoretically the same conditions as the other competitors in the competition. Each attempt is measured to determine who achieved the greatest distance.Vertical JumpsVertical jumps (high jump and pole vault) set a bar at a particular height. The competitor must clear the bar without knocking it off the standards that are holding the bar (flat). Three failures in a row ends the competitor's participation in the event. The competitor has the option to PASS their attempt, which can be used to strategic advantage (of course that advantage is lost if the competitor misses). A pass could be used to save energy and avoid taking a jump that would not improve their position in the standings. After all competitors have either cleared, passed or failed their attempts at a height, the bar goes up. The amount the bar goes up is predetermined before the competition, though when one competitor remains, that competitor may choose their own heights for the remaining attempts. A record is kept of each attempt by each competitor. After all competitors have taken their attempts, the one jumping the highest is the winner, and so on down the other competitors in the event. Ties are broken by first, the number of attempts taken at the highest height (fewest wins), and then if still tied, by the total number of misses in the competition as a whole. The bar does not go back to a lower height except to break a tie for first place or a qualifying position. If those critical positions are still tied after applying the tiebreakers, all tied competitors take a fourth jump at the last height. If they still miss, the bar goes down one increment where they again jump. This process continues until the tie is broken.Horizontal JumpsHorizontal jumps (long jump and triple jump) and all throws must be initiated behind a line. In the case of horizontal jumps, that line is a straight line perpendicular to the runway. In the case of throws, that line is an arc or a circle. Crossing the line while initiating the attempt invalidates the attempt—it becomes a foul. All landings must occur in a sector. For the jumps, that is a sand filled pit, for throws it is a defined sector. A throw landing on the line on the edge of sector is a foul (the inside edge of the line is the outside edge of the sector). Assuming a proper attempt, officials measure the distance from the closest landing point back to the line. The measuring tape is carefully straightened to the shortest distance between the point and the line. To accomplish this, the tape must be perfectly perpendicular to the take off line in jumps, or is pulled through the center point of the arc for throws. The officials at the landing end of the tape have the zero, while the officials at the point of initiation measure and record the length. Whenever a record (or potential record) occurs, that measurement is taken (again) with a steel tape, and observed by at least three officials (plus usually the meet referee). Steel tapes are easily bent and damaged, so are not used to measure everyday competitions. For major competitions, each competitor gets three tries. The top competitors (usually 8 or 9 depending on that competition's rules or the number of lanes on the track) gets three more tries. At that level of competition, the order of competitors for those final three attempts are set—so the competitor in first place at the end of the third round is last, while the last competitor to qualify goes first. Some meets rearrange the competition order again for the final round, so the final attempt is taken by the leader at that point. At other competitions, meet management may choose to limit all competitors to four or three attempts. Whatever the format, all competitors get an equal number of attempts.Equipment Men and women have different weights for their throwing implements – men's javelin is 800 grams compared to 600 for women, men's weight throw is 35 pounds compared to 20 for women, men's discus is 2 kilograms to women's 1, men's shot put is 16 pounds compared to 8 pounds for women, and men's hammer throw is also 16 pounds to the women's 8. Additionally, men's high hurdles are at height of 42 inches compared to women's hurdles which are 33 inches. For the intermediate hurdles (400 meter hurdles), the men's hurdle height is 36 inches compared to 30 inches for women.Organizations The international governance of track and field falls under the jurisdiction of athletics organisations. World Athletics is the global governing body for track and field, and athletics as a whole. The governance of track and field at continental and national level is also done by athletics bodies. Some national federations are named after the sport, including USA TrackField and the Philippine Amateur TrackField Association, but these organisations govern more than just track and field and are in fact athletics governing bodies. These national federations regulate sub-national and local track and field clubs, as well as other types of running clubs.CompetitionsOlympics, Paralympics and world championshipsThe major global track and field competitions are both held under the scope of athletics. Track and field contests make up the majority of events on the Olympic and Paralympic athletics programmes, which occur every four years. Track and field events have held a prominent position at the Summer Olympics since its inception in 1896, and the events are typically held in the main stadium of the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Events such as the 100 metres receive some of the highest levels of media coverage of any Olympic or Paralympic sporting event.The other two major international competition for track and field are organised by the IAAF. The IAAF had selected the Olympic competition as its world championship event in 1913, but a separate world championships for athletics alone was first held in 1983 – the IAAF World Championships in Athletics. The championships comprised track and field competitions plus the marathon and racewalking competitions. Initially, this worked on a quadrennial basis but, after 1991, it changed to a biennial format. In terms of indoor track and field, the IAAF World Indoor Championships has been held every two years since 1985 and this is the only world championships that consists of solely track and field events.Other championshipsSimilar to the event programmes at the Olympics, Paralympics and World Championships, track and field forms a significant part of continental championships. The South American Championships in Athletics, created in 1919, was the first continental championships and the European Athletics Championships became the second championships of this type in 1934. The Asian Athletics Championships and African Championships in Athletics were created in the 1970s and Oceania started its championships in 1990.There are also indoor continental competitions in Europe (European Athletics Indoor Championships) and Asia (Asian Indoor Athletics Championships). There has not been a consistent championships for all of North America, which may be (in part) due to the success of both the Central American and Caribbean Championships and the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships. Most countries have a national championship in track and field and, for athletes, these often play a role in gaining selection into major competitions. Some countries hold many track and field championships at high school and college-level, which help develop younger athletes. Some of these have gained significant exposure and prestige, such as the NCAA Track and Field Championship in the United States and the Jamaican High School Championships. However, the number and status of such competitions significantly vary from country to country.Multi-sport eventsMirroring the role that track and field events have at the Summer Olympics and Paralympics, the sport is featured within the athletics programmes of many major multi-sport events. Among some of the first of these events to follow the Olympic-style model were the World University Games in 1923, the Commonwealth Games in 1930, and the Maccabiah Games in 1932. The number of major multi-sport events greatly increased during the 20th century and thus did the number of track and field events held within them. Typically, track and field events are hosted at the main stadium of the games.After the Olympic and Paralympic Games, the most prominent events for track and field athletes include the three IOC-sanctioned continental games: the All-Africa Games, Asian Games, and the Pan American Games. Other games such as the Commonwealth Games and Summer Universiade, and World Masters Games have significant participation from track and field athletes. Track and field is also present at the national games level, with competitions such as the Chinese National Games serving as the most prestigious national competition for domestic track and field athletes.Meetings main|Track and field meeting As of May 2010, no such article –> One-day track and field meetings form the most common and seasonal aspect of the sport – they are the most basic level of track and field competition. Meetings are generally organised annually either under the patronage of an educational institution or sports club, or by a group or business that serves as the meeting promoter. In the case of the former, athletes are selected to represent their club or institution. In the case of privately run or independent meetings, athletes participate on an invitation-only basis.The most basic type of meetings are all-comers track meets, which are largely small, local, informal competitions that allow people of all ages and abilities to compete. As meetings become more organized they can gain official sanctioning by the local or national association for the sport.At the professional level, meetings began to offer significant financial incentives for all athletes in the 1990s in Europe with the creation of the 'Golden Four' competition, comprising meetings in Zürich, Brussels, Berlin and Oslo. This expanded and received IAAF backing as the IAAF Golden League in 1998, which was later supplemented by the branding of selected meetings worldwide as the IAAF World Athletics Tour. In 2010, the Golden League idea was expanded globally as the Diamond League series and this now forms the top tier of professional one-day track and field meetings.World rankingsThe IAAF World Rankings system was introduced for the 2018 season. An athlete's position within the ranking will be determined by points scored based on their performance and importance of the competition. The points will be considered for eligibility for the World Athletics Championships and Olympic Games. This system will affect athlete participation, which has typically been determined by national bodies, either through selection panels or national trials events.RecordsAthletes performances are timed or measured at virtually all track and field competitions. Doing so can not only serve as a way of determining the winner in an event, but it can also be used for historical comparison (i.e. a record). A large variety of record types exist and men's and women's performances are recorded separately. The foremost types of records organise athlete's performances by the region they represent—beginning with national records, then continental records, up to the global or world record level. National governing bodies control the national record lists, the area associations organise their respective continental lists, and the IAAF ratifies world records.The IAAF ratifies track and field world records if they meet their set criteria. The IAAF first published a world records list in 1914, initially for men's events only. There were 53 recognised records in running, hurdling and relay, and 12 field records. World records in women's events began in 1936 as more events were gradually added to the list, but significant changes were made in the late 1970s. First, all records in imperial measurements were abandoned in 1976, with the sole exceptional being the mile run due to the prestige and history of the event. The following year, all world records in sprint events would only be recognised if fully automatic electronic timing was used (as opposed to the traditional hand-timing stopwatch method). In 1981, electronic timing was made compulsory for all world record runs in track and field, with times being recorded to within one hundredth of a second. Two additional types of world record were introduced in 1987: world records for indoor competitions, and world records for junior athletes under 20 years old.The next most important record type are those achieved at a specific competition. For example, the Olympic records represent the best performances by athletes at the Summer Olympics. All major championships and games have their relevant competition records and a large number of track and field meetings keep a note of their meet records. Other record types include: stadium records, records by age range, records by disability, and records by institution or organisation. Cash bonuses are usually offered to athletes if they break significant records, as doing so can generate greater interest and public attendance in track and field competitions.DopingTrack and field athletes are banned from ingesting or using certain substances by governing bodies for the sport, from the national to the international level. The IAAF's constitution incorporates the World Anti-Doping Code among other anti-doping measures. Practices such as blood doping and the use of anabolic steroids, peptide hormones, stimulants, or diuretics can give athletes a physical competitive advantage in track and field. The use of such substances in track and field is opposed on both ethical and medical grounds. Given that the sport functions by measuring and comparing athletes' performances, performance-enhancing substances create an uneven playing field — athletes who do not use doping substances have a disadvantage over rivals who do. Medically, the use of banned substances may have an adverse effect upon athletes' health. However, some exemptions are made for athletes who take banned substances for therapeutic use, and athletes are not sanctioned for usage in these cases, such as Kim Collins' failed drug test due to asthma medication.Athletes have historically been willing to take legal and health risks to improve their performance, with some even stating their willingness to risk their lives, as exemplified by research by Mirkin, Goldman and Connor in researching attitudes to the so-called Goldman dilemma. To prevent use of performance-enhancing substances, athletes must submit to drug tests that are conducted both in and out of competition by anti-doping officials or accredited medical staff. Penalized athletes are susceptible to higher testing upon return to competition. Athletes found to have taken substances on the World Anti-Doping Agency's banned list receive sanctions and may be banned from competition for a period of time that corresponds to the seriousness of the infraction. However, the use of substances not on the prohibited list may also result in sanctions if the substance is deemed similar to a banned substance in either composition or effect. Athletes may also be sanctioned for missing tests, seeking to avoid testing or tampering with results, refusing to submit to testing, through circumstantial evidence, or confession of use.Doping has played a significant part in the modern history of track and field. State-sponsored doping in East Germany with hormones and anabolic steroids marked the rise of women from East Germany in track and field from the late 1960s to the 1980s. A number of these women, such as Marita Koch, broke world records and were highly successful at international competitions. Some athletes, who were following a doping plan from their teenage years, suffered significant health problems as a result of the regime. A similar state-sponsored doping system was developed in the Soviet Union. In 2016, The New York Times published an article detailing the use of doping by the Soviets in preparation for the 1984 Olympics. Ben Johnson ran a new world record in the 100 metres at the 1988 Seoul Olympics but was later banned for using anabolic steroids. In the mid-first decade of the 21st century, the BALCO Scandal eventually resulted in the downfall of prominent sprinters such as Marion Jones and Tim Montgomery, among others, through their usage of banned substances. The revelation state-sponsored doping in Russia led to an international ban on all its athletes in 2016, with Russians having to apply to the IAAF to compete as Authorised Neutral Athletes at events such as the 2016 Summer Olympics and 2017 World Championships in Athletics. Doping has affected countries on all continents and has occurred in individual, team and national settings.Related sports Track and field bears most similarity to the others categorised under the sport of athletics, specifically cross country running, and road forms of racewalking and running. All these forms of racing tend to record finishing times, have strictly defined start and finish points, and are generally individual in nature. Middle- and long-distance runners usually participate in cross country and road events, in addition to the track. Track racewalkers are most typically road specialists as well. It is unusual for track and field athletes outside of these two groups to compete in cross country or road events.Varieties of strength athletics, such as the World's Strongest Man and highland games, often incorporate forms of footracing, carrying heavy objects, as well as throwing events such as the caber toss and keg toss, which bear similarities to track and field throwing events.See also Cross country running List of track and field stadiums by capacity Racewalking Road runningReferencesExternal linksWorld Athletics official website USA TrackField official website Track and field at About.com Results and statistics for collegiate, high school, middle school, and club teams Masters TF World RankingsIndividual sports Athletics by type Articles containing video clips", "machine_text": " Track and field is a sport defined as the competitive use of speed, agility, strength and techniques in running, jumping, throwing and walking. It includes all forms of competition that involve running, jumping and throwing of any kind, either as individual or team events. Track and field events have been part of the modern Olympic Games since the first modern Olympics in 1896, and are considered to be one of the oldest and most iconic sports. Track and field events take place indoors and outside with distinct disciplines such as sprint, middle-distance and distance running; hurdle sprinting; the high jump, the pole vault, the shot put, the discus, the javelin and the hammer throw. Long and middle-distance running races take place on the track, whilst sprints, hurdles and jumps are held in an open area adjacent to the track. Throwing events usually take place in a field or a throwing ring, in a dedicated area of the stadium. The basic rules of track and field are simple. In sprinting events, athletes must stay within their own marked lanes. In throwing events, participants must be clearly marked on the ground in between throws. In jumping events, the athlete must stay in front of the take-off line. In the long jump and the triple jump, the athlete must leave the line when the bell is rung. Track and field can be both a professional and recreational sport. Competitions range from local amateur athletics clubs, internal competitions such as school sports days; through to regional, national and international competitions such as the Olympics, Commonwealth Games, European Athletics championships, the World Championships and the annual Grand Prix athletics panel. As a professional sport, track and field athletes may be recruited from around the globe by talent scouts and there is considerable money to be earned in sponsorships, endorsements, competitions and contracts. At the highest level, track and field athletes must be able to deliver consistent, high-quality performances in order to remain competitive and to attract and retain sponsors. Such athletes must also demonstrate excellent endurance, body control, strength, agility, power, speed and coordination in order to succeed. Physical fitness, discipline, skill and dedication are key components of any professional track and field athlete's life. Track and field remains one of the most popular and enduring sports in the world for its rich history, its thrilling competition, its appeal to both professional and recreational athletes and its thrilling excitement every time someone crosses the finish line. Whether it's professional athletes competing at the highest level or children just starting out, track and field is an enduring sport that will continue to capture the hearts of many for years to come.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 194904}

Smyth began to gain recognition in his hometown of Belfast as a member of the Belfast Rowing Club, where he was known for his strong, powerful strokes. He increasingly took part in the 'High Class' rowing competitions of the winter season, featuring in regattas including the Caledonian and Belfast Regattas, and soon found himself competing on a larger stage, with the Thames and Henley regattas as his target battlegrounds. In 1888, Smyth entered his first professional rowing competition, the 1888 Thames Regatta. Here, he defeated the New Rowing Club's crew by six lengths to take first place, and word of his success quickly spread throughout the British Isles. Smyth went on to compete in the 1889 Henley Regatta, finishing a creditable second to Eton's crew in the Town Challenge Cup. Despite his successes, very little is known about Leicester Smyth's subsequent life or even his fate. The 1891 British Census does not list Smyth as being in the regular population. It is believed that he likely died in 1890, in between his 1888 and 1889 Thames and Henley successes, at the age of 36. Leicester Smyth's place in Irish rowing history is remembered fondly; he is credited with being the first Irishman to take first place in a professional Thames Regatta, a popular event at that time. He is further remembered today for his inspirational story; a working-class man finding success through hard work and respect at a time where working-class sportsmen were looked down upon.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 25643720}

His relatives Lee and Jono Finnerty (Dylan Brown and Colin Parry) track her down but Alfie scares them off by pretending to be a CID officer, though they take most of Kat's money. Alfie and Kat have a heart to heart and it is revealed that Alfie spent six months in prison for property fraud and they tried to have a baby but he has fertility problems. Kat is not interested and tries to leave, telling him that she is pregnant and he is not the father. Alfie doubles the remainder of Kat's money in a bet and promises to stop scamming and get a proper job. Kat gives him 24 hours. He uses Kat's money and uses it to rent The Queen Vic from Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Kat is angry and demands he get the money back as they need a regular income. Instead, he sets up an illegal drinking den in the cellar and they move into Kim Fox's (Tameka Empson) caravan on the Square.Alfie hires Greg Jessop (Stefan Booth) to refurbish The Queen Vic and Alfie's cousin, Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd), gives him money for The Queen Vic lease.

Charlie decides to join the New Year's party, rather than stay with Tommy so he is unattended when Ronnie Mitchell finds herself in The Queen Vic with her dead son and she swaps the babies. When Alfie gets home, he finds 'Tommy' dead in his cot. Kat and Alfie struggle to cope with their loss but eventually start to deal with it until Michael returns, wanting to see his son. Kat tells Michael to leave but he stays because he has friends locally. Kat kisses Michael but he rejects her, leading her to break down. Eventually Alfie moves out after they have a row and goes away for a weekend with Michael. Kat tells Alfie that a coroner has confirmed that Tommy (James) died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.

However, Derek is scammed by Alfie and Billy and he suspects Phil conned him. When Billy is arrested on suspicion of murdering Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison), Derek worries that he may implicate them in the alcohol theft and asks Alfie to frame Phil by hiding goods at his garage. However, Alfie is caught and Phil confronts him, making it clear that Alfie takes orders from him, not Derek. When Derek learns that Alfie has told Phil everything, he furiously threatens Alfie.In Kat's absence, Alfie and Roxy become close friends and Roxy tells Alfie that she is in love with him. This makes things awkward and she quits her job at the pub. After a while, Alfie manages to convince Roxy to return and offers her a place to stay. Jean is conned out of money that belongs to The Queen Victoria while Alfie is away and when he returns, he borrows money from Roxy to pay the bills, angering Kat. Alfie starts a pub football team and pays more attention to that than to Kat, so she starts an affair. Kat tries to resist but eventually the affair turns to love. When Kat's lover sends her flowers, Alfie becomes suspicious and asks Kat if she is seeing someone else. She denies it initially but eventually admits it, refusing to say who the other man is. Alfie demand Kat end the affair but Alfie struggles to trust Kat, especially when he finds a ring he thought had been pawned. Wanting to catch her out, Alfie says he will be away overnight and follows her to a nearby flat, demanding to know who Kat is seeing but she still refuses to name him. Alfie finds a letter to 'Mr. Branning' and confronts the three brothers, attacking Max when he sees that Kat is calling. Kat arrives and tells him that she is seeing Derek.

He returns a month later and tells Kat that he has just bought a classic Ford Capri. After a night in a posh hotel, they return to Walford and Alfie sets up a burger bar on the Square but this is taken away so he sets up a men's clothes stall instead. This doesn't last thanks to a feud with the market inspector, Aleks Shirovs (Kristian Kiehling), so he gets a job at Ian's café.

Despite Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) advising him against it, he drops a lit cigarette into a paper-filled wastebasket. When outside, he learns Kat is in the house and rushes back to rescue her but Mo's stash of dodgy hairspray causes an explosion, just as Alfie opens the front door. He rescues Kat regardless, receiving minor burns, but Kat is badly burnt. Alfie and the Moons are supported by the local community and stay with the Masood family. Alfie is praised as a hero, despite being suspected by local firefighter Tosh. However, the fire investigation officer declares the fire an accident but Mick advises him not to tell Kat that he started the fire and when Kat thanks him for saving her life, he takes Mick's advice. He is relieved when the fire investigation officer Neil Wallace informs him that the insurers will probably pay for the damage to be repaired but Stacey finds the picture of Nana Moon and realises Alfie started the fire and demands Alfie tell Kat but he refuses, creating a rift between them. The insurance company also refuse to pay for the damage as Mo's quantity of hairspray is listed as commercial goods, invalidating the policy. He tells Stacey Branning (Lacey Turner) and she suggests ringing the insurance company again but Alfie refuses, adamant that they won’t change their decision and blames Mo. Stacey then suggests Alfie use the proceeds from selling the Capri to sort out their finances but he can't as the money was spent on food and the children.

He agrees and they marry at the registrar's office with two nurses as witnesses and return to Walford. They squat in a couple of places before Mick invites them to stay at The Queen Vic. After an emotional speech from Kat to the social housing manager, they are offered a council house in Hull but just as they are about to leave, Kat finds a photo of Nana.

Later, as Christmas approaches, Alfie tells Kat that he will try to fix things.Mo tells Kat that Harry left her some money in his will. Alfie finds out, and tries to convince her to use the money to make a fresh start after the divorce but she destroys the cheque, insisting it doesn't change the past nor their impending divorce. Kat has second thoughts about the divorce after Pam Coker (Lin Blakley) gives a speech about love and family and Stacey tells Alfie that their rent is increasing and Kat is struggling financially so Alfie invites Kat to his flat for lunch and they reminisce about their relationship. The next day, Kat lashes out at Alfie for leaving leftovers for the kids, but at Stacey's urging, she agrees to be his date to Ian and Jane's wedding if he makes more effort for making up for the fire.Mo has Harry's money transferred to her account and tells Alfie. He insists that this is not good for Kat and tells her so she burns the money. Sadly, this makes her very depressed and she tries to commit suicide but Alfie finds her and calls an ambulance. At the hospital, he admits that he is still in love with her. He takes her home and decides to stay temporarily to help her with the kids and her assessment by Social Services.

Only three 78rpm and no 45rpm copies are known to exist'.After the group broke up, several of the members went on to join other groups, such as The Videos.The recording of 'Stormy Weather' In 1952, after months of performing at local functions, The Five Sharps were spotted by a producer and taken into a studio to record two songs. The group recorded their own 'Sleepy Cowboy' and the standard 'Stormy Weather'. The session took most of the day and they were paid in hot dogs and soda pop.First tenor Bobby Ward remembers that sales of 'Stormy Weather' were so bad that he and the other members had to buy their own copies, even though they had never been paid for the recording in the first place. The song was released on Jubilee #5104.The 78 rpm In late 1961, record collector Billy Pensabene found a 78 rpm copy of the record and brought it to Times Square Records, run by Irving 'Slim' Rose. Slim borrowed the record to play on his 'Sink Or Swim With Swingin' Slim' radio show on WBNX. While in his care, however, the record was broken. Slim admitted in June 1965 that the record 'broke under [his] arm' on the way home from the studio, but at other times he claimed that his pet raccoon, Teddy, had broken the disc by sitting on it.Slim assured his angry customer that he would replace the broken record. He put up a sign in his store offering 25 in credit for a 78 of the song and50 for a 45 rpm single. When weeks went by without any takers on his offer, Slim raised the rewards. Slim then went to the owner of Jubilee Records, Jerry Blaine, to get him to reissue the original. He was told that 'Stormy Weather' was one of a batch of 80 masters which had been destroyed in a fire.Since Jubilee, in 1952, had been releasing singles on both the 78 and 45 formats, collectors assumed that there must be a 45 somewhere (even then, collectors valued 45s much more than 78s). None ever surfaced, however, and only a handful of 78's of 'Stormy Weather' have ever been found.The re-recording In 1964, as the legend of the song grew, Jubilee hired a new group of musicians, under the name of The Five Sharps. They then recorded a new version of 'Stormy Weather'. It was released as Jubilee 5478, a 45 single. This version is not nearly as collectible as the first version.After 'Stormy Weather' Cuffey was diagnosed with leukemia and died in 1960. Bassett joined late-period incarnations of both the Drifters and the Flamingos, and later, formed the 1970s band, Creative Funk. Bobby Ward cut one unsuccessful record titled 'The Key To The City' in New York in the mid 1960s, but was largely inactive musically. The other members, pianist Tommy Duckett and Mickey Owens, left the music industry until 1975, when four of the surviving group members, including Ward, performed at the Academy of Music in New York.ReferencesJubilee Records artists Doo-wop groups Musical groups from Queens, New York", "machine_text": " The Five Sharps were an American rhythmblues vocal group that rose to fame during the 1950s. They originated in Chicago, Illinois, United States and consisted of five members: lead singer Jimmy Johnson, guitarist/vocalist Frank Holden, guitarist David Williams, bassist Ernie Tucker, and drummer John Day. Born and raised in the Bronzeville neighborhood of Chicago, they formed while attending the same high school. Initially, they sang in the classroom, imitating their musical heroes such as the Ink Spots and Five Keys. Soon after, they were performing regularly at local shows and eventually arranged their own gigs. In 1950, The Five Sharps were signed to independent Chicago-based label Chance Records. Released in October of that year, their debut single, 'Stormy Weather', charted on the Top 10 RB and Top 30 Billboard Pop. Through the rest of the year, the Sharps would go on to record more singles for Chance Records, including 'Time's A-Wastin', 'What Would I Do Without You?', and their classic hit, 'Stormy Weather'. The Sharps' style of music was described as a mix of RB, gospel, and blues, with lead vocalist Jimmy Johnson delivering smooth falsetto vocals reminiscent of Nat King Cole. Their Chance Records releases became popular throughout the United States and abroad, although they never achieved the amount of success they deserved. In 1952, the group disbanded after their last release, 'A Doggone Good Feelin', failed to chart. They continued to perform throughout Chicago up until the mid-1960s, when the members began to enlist in the United States military or pursue individual career paths. Today, The Five Sharps are remembered as one of the first African-American vocal groups to record in the United States. Although they did not achieve superstar status, many of their songs, such as 'Stormy Weather', remain beloved by fans of classic RB and doo-wop.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 19150333}

This would turn out to be the last time the Spurs would finish with a sub-.500 record until the 1985–86 season, caused by the introduction of the three-point line and the blockbuster trade the club made prior to the 1983–84 season. In the offseason, the Spurs lost two key players to the expansion draft as George Karl and Truck Robinson were selected by the Kansas City Kings and the New Jersey Nets respectively. The Spurs replaced them with players such as Dave Hollins who was drafted in the second round, Ralph Simpson and Ritchie Powers.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Catstye Cam\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Catstye Cam is a fell in the English Lake District. It is an outlier of Helvellyn in the Eastern Fells.Name The name of the fell is also given as 'Catstycam', a spelling preferred by Alfred Wainwright in his influential Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells. A third variant, 'Catchedicam', is also quoted by him. Other guidebooks such as Collins Landranger and Birkettfollow Wainwright with 'Catstycam', although the maps of the Ordnance Survey always use 'Catstye Cam'.Topography The Helvellyn range runs broadly north to south for about 7 miles, remaining above 2,000 ft (600 m) throughout its length. Helvellyn itself sits near the centre of this ridge and displays the characteristic form of many of these fells, namely smooth grassy slopes to the west and shattered rock to the east. Helvellyn sends out two eastward arêtes, razor-thin ridges between deep mountain corries. The southerly spur is Striding Edge, easily the most famous ridge in the district, and its northern partner is Swirral Edge. From the summit plateau of Helvellyn a rough slope drops to the start of Swirral Edge, and this narrow ridge curves gracefully down and then back up over half a mile, terminating at Catstye Cam.Taking on the classic mountain shape of a pyramid, Catstye Cam draws the eye in any view where the overtopping bulk of Helvellyn is hidden behind. As Wainwright said 'If Catstycam stood alone, remote from its fellows, it would be one of the finest peaks in Lakeland. It has nearly, but not quite, the perfect mountain form with true simplicity in its soaring lines, and a small pointed top, a real summit that falls away on all sides'. Even with the connection to Helvellyn, Catstye Cam still has a prominence of over 200 ft due to the pronounced bow of Swirral Edge. High Spying How on Striding Edge, by comparison, is nothing but a rock turret, an independent peak in almost no-one's estimation.East of the summit the ridge declines quickly to Red Tarn Beck, whilst there is a third ridge to the north west, giving Catstye Cam a triangular plan. To the north, between the two descending ridges, is an area of crag. The other two faces are steep but smooth.South of Catstye Cam, nestling between the encircling arms of Helvellyn's two edges, is Red Tarn. This pool is named for the colour of the surrounding screes rather than its water, and contains brown trout and schelly, a fresh-water herring. The depth of Red Tarn is now about 80 ft, although in the mid-19th century it was dammed with boulders to increase capacity. This was carried out to provide additional water to the Greenside Mine in Glenridding, the water race still visible as it crosses the slope of Birkhouse Moor.A second tarn once existed in Brown Cove to the north at Catstye Cam, but this is now reduced to a couple of small pools widening the stream. Brown Cove Tarn was another creation of the Greenside mine, a stone faced dam being built in about 1860. The dam is still in place but water now leaks through the base, the extended tarn-bed a smooth patch of luxuriant turf. A water leat passing beneath the north face of Catstye Cam to Red Tarn Beck can still be traced although it is now in ruins. Water from Brown Cove and Red Tarn unites at the base of the east ridge to form Glenridding Beck, flowing on through the village to Ullswater.Geology The principal rock type is the dacitic lapilli-tuff of the Helvellyn Formation.Summit The summit of Catstye Cam is small and neat, bearing only a tiny cairn. The view is extensive and even the looming Helvellyn only adds to the drama by showing its eastern face in close detail. Striding Edge is also seen in profile across Red Tarn, lines of pilgrims frequently queueing at the bottlenecks. By contrast Catstye Cam is often almost completely deserted.AscentsCatstye Cam is normally climbed from Glenridding, either by its east or north west ridges. Both are steep, but there are no technical difficulties. A fair path also climbs via Red Tarn to the midpoint of Swirral Edge, from where a brief detour back to the summit can be made. By far the best option is a circular tour via Striding and Swirral Edges. This takes in Birkhouse Moor, Helvellyn and Catstye Cam, one of the most breathtaking walks in the country.ReferencesHewitts of England Fells of the Lake District Nuttalls Patterdale", "machine_text": " Catstye Cam (from the Old English language cæst þe camm, meaning 'jagged peak') is a mountain in the Cumbrian Mountains of England. Located near the Anglo-Scottish border, its summit is approximately 845 m (2,772 ft) above sea level, making it the sixth-highest summit in the county of Cumbria. The mountain stands on its own without any significant height neighbours, allowing for spectacular views in all directions. From its top there are views of Bowfell, the Langdale Pikes, Great Gable and Sca Fell, as well as the Solway Firth and Northumberland National Park. A road leading to the summit is the basis of a challenging and popular drive for recreational 4x4 drivers. As a result, the mountain was declared a Site of Special Scientific Interest in August 2002. The mountain is often climbed from the Startle Tarn valley to the east, where there is a small lake, garden, and parking. It’s possible to follow the stream upwards and take either the east ridge or the south ridge, as both offer reasonably easy access. The south ridge is more popular, as it provides better views over the valley below. The east and south ridge of Catstye Cam are very popular among climbers and hikers alike, providing a challenging climb, with some moderate scrambling and good exposure. The rock on the mountain is mostly sandstone, with some areas of slate and volcanic rock. The mountain can also be accessed from St Sunday Crag, via the ridge path, which runs along Cofa Pike, Nethermost Pike and onwards to Catstye Cam. This route is a bit longer than the direct ascent from the east, but it also offers some of England’s best views. Catstye Cam is an iconic peak in the Cumbrian Mountains, providing fantastic landscapes and stunning views in all directions.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Barbaridactylus\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Barbaridactylus is a nyctosaurid pterosaur from the Ouled Abdoun Basin of Morocco, a basin that dates back to the Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous. It was published in 2018 by paleontologists Nicholas R. Longrich, David M. Martill, and Brian Andres. In the same publication, two other nyctosaurids from the same basin were described: Alcione and Simurghia. The type and only species is B. grandis.Discovery and namingAll known specimens of Barbaridactylus were uncovered in a 3-year dig that unearthed about 200 pterosaur specimens. Its type specimen is FSAC-OB 232, which consists of its right femur, left radius, ulna, humerus, and scapulocoracoid, and partial mandible. Four other specimens have been referred to Barbaridactylus, FSAC-OB 8, 9, 10, and 11. They are all humeri.Barbaridactylus is named after the Barbary Coast of North Africa, and the Greek dactylo, meaning 'finger'. The proper word for 'finger' in Ancient Greek however, is daktylos (δάκτυλος). Its specific name, grandis means 'great' in Latin.DescriptionBarbaridactylus is a large nyctosaurid, with a humerus length of . Like other nyctosaurids, Barbaridactylus had upward-curving jaws. The only known cervical is also rather typical for nyctosaurids, as it is proportionately short and broad, a morphology also present in the related pteranodontids. The scapulocoracoid is fused, meaning that the animal was probably an adult. It is boomerang shaped, and the two bones (the scapula and coracoid) form a 60 degree angle. The humeral shaft is long and thin. The hatchet-shaped deltopectoral crest (a distinctive feature of nyctosaurids) is in a notably distal location in relation to the humeral head, more similar to that of Nyctosaurus than Alcione. This crest is short and broad, and the expanded tip is weakly developed, which are basal features. The deltopectoral crest appears warped from an anterior view, more so than in other nyctosaurids, but much less than in pteranodontids. There is a pneumatic fossa located on the ventral surface of each humeral head that is unique to this species. The ulna is relatively gracile, unlike the robust ulna of Alcione, and its ends are weakly expanded. The diameter radius is approximately two thirds that of the ulna. The femur of Barbaridactylus is relatively typical for a nyctosaurid, although it lacks the strong distal expansion present in other nyctosaurids. Instead, it expands more gently, similar to that of Pteranodon.Classification Below is a cladogram showing the results of a phylogenetic analysis first presented by Andres and colleagues in 2014, and updated with additional data by Longrich and colleagues in 2018. In this analysis, they found Barbaridactylus to be the sister taxon of the Nyctosaurus species N. lamegoi, both placed within the family Nyctosauridae.PaleoecologyBarbaridactylus was discovered in upper Maastrichtian phosphates located in the Ouled Abdoun Basin of Northern Morocco. This geological formation does not belong to a formation. It is divided into couches, with Barbaridactylus being discovered in Couche III. This layer dates back to the latest Maastrichtian, about 1 million years before the extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous. Couche III represents the most diverse marine ecosystem known from the time.A large variety of marine life is known from the region, including sharks and bony fish, in addition to turtles, plesiosaurs and mosasaurs. A few rare, fragmentary dinosaur fossils are known, including an abelisaur and a sauropod. Other pterosaurs in the formation were originally only represented by the azhdarchid Phosphatodraco mauritanicus. However, in addition to Barbaridactylus, more recent studies have revealed at least five more pterosaur species from this location, including Alcione, Simurghia and Tethydraco.ReferencesLate Cretaceous pterosaurs of Africa Fossil taxa described in 2018 Pteranodontians", "machine_text": " Barbaridactylus is an extinct genus of pterosaur, a type of flying reptile, from the Late Jurassic period of what is now Germany. It is known from a number of fragmentary fossil remains found in fossil-bearing limestone deposits at Petersbuch near Eichstatt, Bavaria. Barbaridactylus was first described in 2003 by German paleontologist Oliver W. M. Rauhut. The genus belongs to the Pterodactyloidea (commonly known as Pterodactyls) and is thought to the the closest relative of the ornithocheirid pterosaurs Ornithocheirus and Aurorazhdarcho. Barbaridactylus fossils were first discovered in the late 1950s and became known as the Petersbuch fossil remains. The fossil material includes an assortment of bones and teeth belonging to at least two individuals. From this material, Rauhut was able to determine the genus was approximately 2–3 meters in length, with a wingspan of over 5 meters. Rauhut linked the Petersbuch fossil material to the Ornithocheiridae family because of similar features to its anatomy, including its highly curved teeth, which distinguished it from other pterodactyloids. Barbaricdactylus would have been a powerful and agile flyer, and may have lived in large colonies. Barbaridactylus lived in the Solnhofen Archipelago, a series of isolated islands and tidal flats, around 150 million years ago in the late Jurassic period. The archipelago was home to a diverse range of fauna, including Barbaridactylus and other winged flying reptiles. Today, Barbaridactylus is one of the few pterodactyls whose fossils have been found in Germany and is considered one of the few known transitional species between the Ornithocheiridae and other pterodactyloid clades. Its fossil remains provide important insight into the evolutionary history of the Pterodactyloidea. Despite its significance, only a few fossils of Barbaridactylus have been found, leaving its evolutionary history and relationships with other pterodactyloids unresolved. References * M. O. Elvis, O.

CHKT's studios at 151 Esna Park Drive, Unit 26 in Markham.CHKT is powered at 50,000 watts, the maximum for Canadian AM stations.It uses a directional antenna with a six-tower array, to protect other stations on AM 1430.The transmitter is on one of the Toronto Islands.HistoryCKCL and CKEY The station that was the indirect forerunner of CHKT first signed on the air on May 5, 1925.Its call sign was CKCL, broadcasting at 840 kilocycles, and owned by the Dominion Battery Company. As with many radio stations in the early years of radio broadcasting, the station changed frequencies a number of times in its first years of operation. It settled on 580 kHz frequency in 1931.In 1945, the station was sold to Jack Kent Cooke's Toronto Broadcasting Co., and adopted the call sign CKEY. It was acquired in 1961 by Shoreacres Broadcasting, a consortium that included Westinghouse and The Globe and Mail.CKEY changed its frequency to 590 in 1964 as CKWW signed on at 580 that year in Windsor and CKAR, (known today as CFBK-FM), in Huntsville had to change its frequency from 590 to 630 kHz.Top 40 In the late 1950s and early 1960s, CKEY was the leading Top 40 competitor to 1050 CHUM.One of its DJs was later CFNY staple David Marsden, known as Dave Mickie at CKEY (and later at CHUM as well). Another notable broadcaster was Bryan Fustukian, broadcasting as Vik Armen. The station dropped its Top 40 format for middle of the road music in 1965, now going up against CFRB, and was successful in that arena for a time. Shoreacres, in turn, was acquired by Maclean-Hunter in 1966.A transmitter for CKEY was once located on Midland Avenue and Eglinton Avenue East in Scarborough. This site was sold to the Scarborough Board of Education in 1964 to build Tabor Park Vocational School for the area's redevelopment.From 1972 until the 1990s, CKEY's and then CKYC's offices and studios were located in the Toronto Star building at One Yonge Street.MOR and Oldies From 1970 to 1984, CKEY featured Charles Templeton and Pierre Berton on the commentary show Dialogue with Templeton also reading the morning news for several years. The station also had Stephen Lewis as a commentator in the late 1970s and early 1980s.On January 1, 1984, CKEY flipped from its long running MOR format to soft rock/oldies as 'Solid Gold CKEY.'On April 25, 1988, Key Radio Limited was denied a license to move CKEY from 590 kHz to 99.1 MHz as well The CKO Radio Partnership (CKO) was also denied to move the all-news radio station CKO from 99.1 MHz to 590 kHz.On June 20, 1988, the station became Key 590 moving from its Soft AC and Oldies mix to all Oldies, once again competing directly with a re-formatted CHUM.At 7 p.m. on March 14, 1991, CKEY signed off and began stunting with the sound of a heartbeat. The following morning at 9, the station adopted a country format, changing its call sign to CKYC. The CKEY call sign was subsequently picked up by a station in Fort Erie.Frequency Swap After Rogers Communications acquired Maclean-Hunter in 1994, CKYC was sold to Telemedia. Telemedia subsequently swapped CKYC's frequency with that of its sports outlet CJCL. On February 6, 1995, at 10 AM, CKYC ceased airing country music, and after stunting with a ticking clock for two hours, CJCL and CKYC swapped frequencies.CKYC subsequently aired only syndicated programming until it went off the air permanently in late 1996.CHKT Signs On CHKT was launched as an ethnic, multilingual radio station by Fairchild Group in 1997, over the 1430 AM frequency that had been occupied by CKYC immediately prior to its signing off for the last time.The CKYC call sign was subsequently picked up by a station in Owen Sound in 2001.In October 2019, Fairchild Radio gained public attention when it fired a Toronto radio talk-show host allegedly because of his questions during an interview perceived as critical of the Chinese government's stance on the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests.ReferencesExternal linksFairchild RadioRemembering CKEY Radio Toronto - 580 - 590CHKT history - Canadian Communications FoundationHKT CHKT CHKT HKT 1925 establishments in Ontario", "machine_text": " CHKT is a private broadcasting company located in Kaohsiung City, Taiwan.

His father, Pierre David-Weill (1900–1975), was the chairman of Lazard Frères; his mother was Berthe Haardt. His great-grandfather, , worked at Lazard Freres, a firm co-founded by his cousins, Alexandre, Elie, and Simon Lazard. In 1900, his grandfather, David David-Weill, was named a partner.In 1927, his father Pierre David-Weill became a partner.Separated from his father, who was in New York City during World War II, David-Weill remained behind with his mother in occupied France, and, during the last year of Nazi occupation, at age 11, he hid with his mother and younger sister in the French village of Béduer (Lot, southwestern France) where they were baptized and raised as Catholics (his father Pierre would later convert to Catholicism in 1965). After World War II was over, he went to live in New York City with his family.David-Weill was educated at the Lycée Français de New York and the Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris.Career In 1956, he joined Lazard Freres, and, in 1961, became a partner Under the stewardship of the chairman of André Meyer, Felix Rohatyn, who handled acquisitions, and he himself, who was the bookkeeper, Lazard grew rapidly. In 1975, his father died and he inherited his equity stake in Lazard, becoming the largest stakeholder in both Lazard New York and Lazard Paris, while also holding stakes in Lazard London. In 1977, when Meyer became sick and Rohatyn turned down an offer to replace him, David-Weill was named chairman. He continued to work closely with managing director, Felix Rohatyn, who was also made senior partner at Lazard in 1961. Also, by the power provided in clause 4.1 of the Lazard partnership agreement, he alone had the power to set compensations and the right to fire any partners at his discretion.Under David-Weill's direction, Lazard began to expand its business from traditional merger-and-acquisition advising to areas such as asset management and municipal bond. He also made numerous hires, including Steven Rattner. Lazard's profits also jumped from 5 million in the late 1970s to500 million in the late 1990s. David-Weill also reunited the branches of Lazard by combining his stakes in New York and Paris and a buyout of Pearson for its stake in Lazard London for more than 600 million. After the retirement of Rohatyn, the firm's most prominent dealmaker, Lazard under David-Weill's leadership began to take a turn for the worse. Other dealmakers such as J. Ira Harris and Rattner also left the firm.To strengthen Lazard, David-Weill hired Bruce Wasserstein as the CEO, who later decided to take Lazard public against the wishes of the family patriarch. David-Weill later stated that he regretted ever having hired Wasserstein. David-Weill is currently a director of Groupe Danone, one of the world's largest food-product companies.Personal life In 1956, he married Hélène Marie Lehideux, daughter of Robert Lehideux. They have three children: Béatrice, married first to Bertrand de Villeneuve Bargemont and then to Édouard Stern; Cécile, married to Emmanuel Renom de La Baume; and Nathalie, married to Olivier Merveilleux du Vignaux.

He was also singer and guitarist for Boston from 2007 to 2011.CareerStryperIn the early 1980s, Sweet and his brother started a band called Roxx Regime and played in small venues. They were a trio for a period of time with Sweet being the only guitar player in the band. This band would later become Stryper. The band challenged the stereotype of heavy metal being satanic and took Christian rock into mainstream.With the band, Sweet was not only the lead vocalist and shared lead guitar duties, but he also wrote most of the music for the band as well as co-producing and arranging the music. The band recorded five successful studio albums. The band's reputation declined in the 1990s.Solo After nine years as the lead singer/lead guitarist of Stryper, Sweet left the band in 1992 in order to pursue a solo career. He first released a demo album, Unstryped, which featured several songs allegedly intended for the band. Sweet later included some of these on his first full-length album.His self-titled debut album was released in 1994 and sold over 250,000 copies. He followed it with a slightly softer album titled Real in 1996 earning him a Dove Award nomination. Soon after the release of Real, Sweet left Benson Records, with whom he had released the two albums.During this time, Sweet and his wife Kyle moved to Massachusetts, where Sweet worked at his father-in-law's campground/cranberry business, Maple Park. In 1998, he released an independent demo album titled Truth which received critical acclaim. He was signed to Restless Records and re-released Truth in 2000 with a new song-list and new artwork.On August 19, 2007, Sweet was asked by Boston's Tom Scholz to be one of the lead singers and guitarists for Come Together: A Tribute to the Life of Brad Delp at the Bank of America Pavilion in Boston. Scholz then asked Sweet to join Boston for the band's summer 2008 tour with Styx as the opening act.BostonSweet performed lead vocals, background vocals, and guitar work for Boston. Sweet was asked to be a part of what was supposed to be Boston's last performance on August 19, 2007. It was a benefit and tribute show and names such as Sammy Hagar, Mickey Thomas and Ann Wilson were among the invited guests. Tom Scholz was moved by what Sweet had written about the late Brad Delp and then heard Sweet sing and play guitar. Scholz was so impressed with Sweet's talents that he invited him to join the band and become a permanent member. Boston began booking a tour for 2008 with Styx as the opening act. Sweet handled lead vocals on roughly half of the set list and played guitar for the entire set and handled solo work as well. In August 2011, it was announced that Sweet had left Boston to focus on his priorities and contributions to Stryper.Stryper reunitedIn 1999, Sweet reunited with former Stryper bandmates Oz Fox and Tim Gaines during a concert in Puerto Rico. The concert featured Fox and Gaines's band, SinDizzy. Sweet was invited as a solo artist. The three of them got together for a set of four songs. The next year, the first Stryper Expo was held in New Jersey and the entire line-up was reunited again.Although original bassist, Tim Gaines, left the group in 2005 and was replaced by Tracy Ferrie, the band has continued to work together, releasing a new album titled Reborn, produced by Sweet.

He is best known as the lead vocalist and guitarist of the Christian metal band Stryper, whose albums sold over 10 million copies worldwide. Sweet was born in Whittier, California and is one of seven children in a Christian family. Growing up in a musical family, he learned to perform on guitar, bass, and drums. At the age of 16, Sweet was part of the band Steeler and the group achieved regional success. In the early 1980s, Sweet formed what would become Stryper with his brother Robert ('Rob'). Along with Tim Gaines and Oz Fox, Sweet created a unique sound that blended glam metal and Christian themes. Named after Isaiah 53:5 (which reads: 'But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon him'), the band became known as the first Christian glam metal group. Their 1986 debut album, 'Soldiers Under Command' became hugely successful and yielded several hit singles. Follow-up releases such as 'To Hell With The Devil', 'In God We Trust' and 'Against The Law' kept Stryper's momentum going through the late 1980s. By 1989, the band had recorded four albums and earned eight Dove Award nominations. In the early 1990s, Sweet and his brother Robert dissolved Stryper and began pursuing solo careers. Sweet released several solo albums and wrote for various projects such as Dream Theater, Bon Jovi, and DC Talk for which he earned a Grammy award. In 2003, Stryper reunited and continues to tour and record. In addition to his music career, Sweet is an author and artist, having penned many books and painted several canvases.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"University of South Florida St. Petersburg Baseball Club\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The University of South Florida St. Petersburg Baseball Club was founded during the 2013 Fall semester. The club's president, founder, and head coach, Jeremy Berger, wanted to offer USFSP students the opportunity to play college baseball competitively. Even though the team is treated as a fraternity, both male and female students are welcomed to join the team.The team's opening game was against the University of South Florida Tampa Campus' team. The USFSP baseball team won and earned well deserved bragging rights and huge momentum the team carried throughout the rest of the season. The team finished its inaugural opening season with an 18–5 season and played against larger, well established teams like the University of Florida and Florida State University. The team also traveled to Miami to play the University of Miami. However, because the team is considered only a club and is not a registered, official team, the USFSP Baseball Club was ineligible to play or qualify for any championships or playoffs.However, the team does have long-term plans of becoming an NCAA team. In the meantime, the officers and players are focusing on recruiting more talented players. This way, the team can gain more acknowledgment and support from faculty and students. They also want to establish a name for themselves amongst other colleges. The team also hopes that more fans will come out to support the baseball team during their games next season, even if they do not like baseball. Players have said that simply coming to the game to support student athletes, friends, and classmates is encouraging.Despite being barred from championships at the present time, the team did have some special acknowledgments and awards to accompany its amazing first season including an acknowledgment from USF President Dr. Judy Genshaft and was the2013-14 New Organization of the Year. Berger was also nominated for student leader of the year.The season began on February 15, 2014, with USF St. Petersburg playing against USF Tampa. The competition was dubbed “The Battle of the Bay” and was inspired by the already existent inter-campus rivalries. Dozens of students from both campuses arrived to cheer on their teams. Although the Tampa team, which was also playing its inaugural game, lost the 9-inning contest, both teams hope to make the inter-campus games an annual tradition.For its first season, the team made Al Lang Stadium and Walter Fuller Baseball Stadium its home stadiums. The Al Lang Stadium, a couple blocks away from the school campus and in the heart of downtown St. Petersburg, Florida, hosts dozens of sporting events for several different teams and sports. During soccer season, the stadium is transformed into a soccer field and hosts The Rowdies, the St. Petersburg professional soccer team. When the season is over, however, the field is transformed into a baseball field and allows for amateur baseball teams to play. The Walter Fuller Baseball Stadium was the former spring training field for the Tampa Bay Rays. However, when the Rays moved spring training to the Charlotte Sports Park, the Walter Fuller Baseball Stadium started hosting high school baseball teams and baseball tournaments.On June 5, 2014, the St. Petersburg City Council held a meeting to determine if future contracts with the USFSP team will be made. The council decided in favor for these future contracts to be written. Now, the team has a place to play for at least one more season.USF St. Petersburg has yet to build a stadium for any of the school's organized sports to be played on teams. The small campus does have a gym with dozens of work out machines, a pool, a couple basketball courts, and a waterfront program that gives sailing, scuba diving, and paddle boarding lessons just to name a few of its services.The only team that the USFSP campus houses is the sailing team. This team keeps all of its equipment in the school's harbor and waterfront storage house. Because the school borders against the water, the sailing team practices and races in the ocean behind the campus. Also, because of the nature of this water sport, no benches or bleachers have been made to observe the races from land.All the other USF teams are based out of the USF Tampa campus. However, even in Tampa, the teams often have to go to a different, already established stadium for professional teams in order to play. Even the USF football team has to travel to Raymond James Stadium (the home of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers) to play opponents in games.Despite the USFSP baseball team having an impressive first season and bring more sports to the St. Petersburg campus, it is not the first time a baseball team has represented the small, coastal campus. For several years during the 1970s, not a full decade after the campus was founded, students had built ateam as well. Like today, the team was categorized as a club rather than an actual, registered team - likely due to the fact that it is a club, not a registered team. Players brought their own gloves, bats, and other equipment in order to play since the school did not provide any. Despite this, the team still played larger universities and had impressive season records, much like today's team. Because the USFSP would rarely win against these other registered teams, it often confused the other team about what to do with their records. Other universities did not know if these games should count as wins since the USFSP team was not registered. It was common for these teams to decide not to include the USFSP games in their records. They simply considered the games to be practice or warm ups for the rest of the season.ReferencesExternal linksUniversity of South Florida 2013 establishments in Florida", "machine_text": " The University of South Florida St. Petersburg Baseball Club, commonly referred to as USFSPBC, is a Division-I college baseball program located in St. Petersburg, Florida. Established in 2016, the program competes within the American Athletic Conference and is led by head coach Joe Urso. The USFSPBC began play in the 2016-2017 season with a roster composed primarily of freshman players recruited from outside the local bay area. The club quickly became a competitive force in the AAC, posting an impressive record of 19-9 during its first season. The Bulls went on to finish 38-17 record with a berth in the conference tournament by the end of the team's second season. The team plays its home games at the new Jack National Stadium located on the St. Petersburg Campus of the University of South Florida. The facility was constructed in 2016 at a cost of 12 million, and boasts seating for up to 2,500 fans. The USFSPBC has achieved numerous successes during its brief existence. It is the first college baseball team in the Tampa Bay area to receive a bid to the NCAA tournament since USF's Tampa campus in 2005. The Bulls have also achieved multiple wins against Power Five opponents, with victories over Alabama, Louisville, Mississippi State, and Georgia Tech. The USFSPBC's success has attracted recognition throughout the Tampa Bay area, with the team's five home games this season selling out for the first time in the school's history. The future of the club looks exceptionally bright, with the addition of five-star recruit Hunter Daniels in the 2021-2022 recruiting class. Daniels, a native of Clearwater, Florida, is rated as the top prospect in the state, and is expected to make an immediate impact on the team. The University of South Florida St. Petersburg Baseball Club is quickly becoming a prominent fixture in the Tampa Bay sports landscape, and will only continue to grow and improve in the years ahead.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 43249069}

Formed in 2000 by four high school friends, Fai Amata has become one of Thailand’s most popular acts, with hits such as “Lai ru”, “Khon Kan”, and “Mai Tah Mai”. As teenagers in 2000, Thailand-born counterparts of the band found themselves drawn to their selective musical interests, finding themselves in the garage at least three times a week, jamming and composing in the confines of their soundproofed walls. Fai Amata eventually took form after the members decided to perform at a school-wide event. After a fairly successful showing, the foursome had decided to take their passion for music to the next level by developing their own music label and studio, Catwalk Collective. The four core members of Fai Amata are vocalist/guitarist Prawit “Pee” Seadprasert, guitarist Namfon “Moe” Skontawan, bassist Manit “Klang” Jussawadee, and drummer Narin “Nada” Thamaphol. Unlike most bands in Thailand, their sound is generally in the lyrically provocative punk genre. They also feature electronic and pop influences, as well as hip-hop styling and melodies. The group has released an abundance of singles, EPs and two studio albums, “Mor Lai Pa Jet” in 2003 and “Tae Hao” in 2005. Other popular singles include “Yah Lao” and “Jab Bap”. Their songs often feature social and political commentary, making it relevant and thought-provoking. The band has been recognized for their outstanding contributions, having won a string of awards, such as “The Best Pop Album” from Siam Music Award and “The Best Punk Song” from the Thai Music Awards.

Alien Autopsy is set during 1995 and focuses on Gary and Ray, two cash-strapped British documentary filmmakers who initially encounter a shady video distributor. The distributor claims to possess video evidence of an alien autopsy - a procedure in which alien remains are manipulated by an unknown force. Seeing the potential for financial gain, Gary and Ray decide to take advantage of the opportunity and devise a plan to exploit this film by creating a fabrication of their own. Using a combination of CG animation and practical effects, such as moulage miniatures and prosthetic makeup, the pair craft an alien autopsy hoax and shoot a convincing short film. From there, the hoax grows to incredible heights, as both Gary and Ray lead the world to believe an extraterrestrial autopsy has genuinely taken place in secrecy. The pair travel to the United States in order to pitch the film, which eventually leads to the showing of the alien autopsy hoax in its entirety. News of the film's existence quickly causes controversy and attention in both scientific and sensational circles. The film is accused of being a hoax, leading to an intense debate over the authenticity of the footage itself. Despite the notoriety, the film remains popular and grosses millions of dollars, leading Gary and Ray to reap the financial rewards of their hoax. The movie was released theatrically in the United Kingdom and United States in April 2006, and was met with generally positive reviews.

The phrase can be translated literally to mean “turtle”, which implies a slow and leisurely pace. The term has gained popularity globally due to its connection to living a peaceful, tranquil lifestyle. The idea of kura kura is linked to the concept of wa, or Japanese harmony, which emphasizes the importance of creating peace and balance, both within oneself and in one’s environment. The notion of kura kura is particularly popular among those seeking a zen lifestyle that embraces mindfulness and introspection. Kura Kura is often used to describe a lifestyle defined by a relaxed attitude and an appreciation of life’s small moments and pleasures. This might mean focused self-care such as meditation, yoga, or spending time in nature, but can also include low-key activities such as taking a walk around the neighborhood or sipping on a cup of tea outside. The kura kura lifestyle can be practiced both indoors and outdoors, though it lends itself more to nature-based activities such as camping, hiking, surfing, or simply sitting and appreciating nature’s beauty. Moreover, proponents of kura kura emphasize the importance of being in tune with oneself and the environment, such as taking the time to appreciate the small moments in nature. In terms of consumption, kura kura advocates for a simple, minimalistic approach. This means consuming fewer items, choosing quality over quantity as well as limiting technology and social media usage. Practicers look to establish balance in their lives through mindful consumption and lessening their environmental footprints by reducing their waste and being conscious of what they buy. Kura kura is an inviting lifestyle that has appealed to those looking to slow down and simplify their lives. By taking the time to move at a more leisurely pace, those living a kura kura lifestyle can enjoy life’s small pleasures and moments, create balance in their lives, and develop a greater appreciation of nature.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 67214022}

He married twice: in 1941 to Meri Mirjam Gyllenbögel, who died 1956 (they had one son and two daughters including the ballerina and choreographer Sorella Englund); and in 1958 he married Maynie Sirén, a singer, with whom he had one son.One of the most important Finnish symphonists since Jean Sibelius, Englund was a native Swedish speaker who often felt that his career was sidelined from the mainstream of Finnish music.He went to Svenska normallyceum i Helsingfors and was 17 when he began studies at the Helsinki Conservatory (now the Sibelius Academy) in 1933. Already a considerable pianist, he continued his studies with Martti Paavola and Ernst Linko while studying composition with Bengt Carlson and Selim Palmgren.Following his graduation in 1941, Englund was conscripted into military service. During his time in the Finnish Continuation War he was wounded in his hand, which almost brought to an end his hopes of pursuing a career as a concert pianist. He would often recall the bizarre, though life-threatening incident, with a smile.Music Englund's first work for large orchestra was his First Symphony (1946), which became known as the 'War Symphony'. This was no apprentice piece; the use of counterpoint, dissonance and orchestration of singular clarity reveals a master at work. His Second Symphony, the 'Blackbird Symphony', soon followed the first.In 1949 Englund was awarded a grant to study in the United States with Aaron Copland, and he also played jazz with Leonard Bernstein. It has been suggested that Englund's study with the American master consisted of discussions about music and composition, Copland having realised that there was little he could teach the younger man.Throughout the 1950s he produced a series of large-scale works including Sinuhe, a ballet(1953) originally for piano though later orchestrated, and Odysseus (1959), written for the Swedish dancer and choreographer Birgit Cullberg, a Cello Concerto (1954) and the First Piano Concerto (1955), as well as film scores and incidental music. His score for Erik Blomberg’s Valkoinen peura (The White Reindeer), which won a Jussi Award (the Finnish Oscar), and his score for Max Frisch’s play The Great Wall of China are particularly notable.He composed music for twenty films, as well as works for choir including the Hymnus Sepulcralis (1975).During the 1950s, with his second wife, the singer Maynie Sirén, he performed a cabaret act; he was music critic of the Swedish-language Hufvudstadsbladet, and he taught at the Sibelius Academy from 1958 until 1982.His Third Symphony (1971) appeared 23 years after his second and signalled his return to composition; he had written only a few works during the 1960s. There soon followed his Fourth (1976) and Fifth Symphonies (1977) and the Concerto for Twelve Cellos (1981).Englund’s Sixth Symphony (1984), subtitled Aphorisms, is in six movements for chorus and orchestra; his last symphony, the Seventh, was composed in 1988, coinciding with the onset of the heart disease that signalled a decline in health and would ultimately lead to his death. His Clarinet Concerto of 1991 was completed shortly before a stroke rendered further composition physically impossible. Later he suffered from kidney failure, which necessitated dialysis for the remainder of his life.Englund also composed chamber music, including a suite for solo cello and a sonata for cello and piano; there are also works for violin and piano, solo trombone, and solo piano.His memoirs, I Skuggan av Sibelius (In the Shadow of Sibelius), were published in 1997.

His music is firmly rooted in late romanticism, displaying a strong influence from Sibelius and Bartók. Englund wrote seven symphonies, three of which were premiered at the prestigious Stockholm Concert Hall. Englund was born in Vääksy, near the city of Lahti in Finland in 1916. As a child, he was already exposed to the classic music of the era, such as the works of Mozart, Haydn, and Beethoven. As he grew older, Englund began taking piano lessons, and his prodigious talent was soon recognised. He studied at the Sibelius Academy between 1936 and 1943, studying piano, theory and composition. A touring concert pianist, Englund wrote his first large-scale works during the 1940s. These works include his Symphony No. 1 (1945-1946), Symphony No. 2 (1947-1948), and Piano Concerto (1947-1948). His compositions characteristically feature a mix of nationalist Finnish melodic elements with the structural aspects of neo-classicism, as well as elements of jazz, Bartók and Hindemith. Englund's works of the 1950s, such as Symphony No. 3 (1951), Symphony No. 4 (1952), and Symphony No. 5 (1955), are often considerered to be his main achievement. The greatest success of his career came with his Symphony No. 6, which won the 1959 Nordic Music Prize. This particular symphony brought him international recognition as a major Finnish composer. His next symphony, Symphony No. 7 (1963-1964), was inspired by the works of Sibelius, and was dedicated to him. During the 1970s, he wrote numerous pieces, including orchestral, choral and vocal works. Englund's last symphony, Symphony No. 8, was written in 1981, and he also wrote several chamber works and songs during this time. Einar Englund died in 1999, leaving behind an expansive catalogue of symphonic, theatrical, and chamber works. His influence is still felt today, and although he has not achieved widespread recognition, the Finnish music world still cherishes his legacy.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2153671}

Born in Amsterdam, he attended the Rijksakademie van Beeldende Kunsten (Academy of Visual Arts) and befriended a number of other modernist painters and sculptors in his youth, including Jan Schoonhoven. During the years leading up to World War I, Wulp’s works followed a mild Expressionist style, with dark colours and heavy brushstrokes dominating his paintings. They often depicted ordinary people and everyday scenes in a highly emotive, sometimes grotesque way. Many of his pieces from this time have received international recognition and are part of major art galleries and museums' collection, such as the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. The 1920s saw a change in the direction of John’s artistic expression, as he adopted a more experimental and progressive approach in his works. Many of his works from the period focused on realises his depression and loneliness through figural portrayals and landscapes. The melancholic subject matter was further explored in a series of paintings called ‘Details of a Journey’, which depicted the harshness of industrial landscapes as well as the suffering of the people. During the 1930s, he turned to Neorealism, a new form of art that focused on the representation of ordinary people and everyday life in a more neutral, objective way. He used a softer, more organic style, often depicting small villages and rural scenes with a captivating sense of realism and detail. John Wulp suffered from ill health throughout his life and his career was cut short in 1935 when he suddenly passed away at the age of 42. His contribution to both Expressionism and Neorealism was significant and he is still remembered and revered by modern artists and art critics for his unique and forward-thinking approach. His works can still be seen in many major art galleries around the world and are highly valued by art collectors and critics alike.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 16877253}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Allah jang Palsoe\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Allah jang Palsoe (; Perfected Spelling: Allah yang Palsu; Malay for The False God) is a 1919 stage drama from the Dutch East Indies that was written by the ethnic Chinese author Kwee Tek Hoay based on E. Phillips Oppenheim's short story 'The False Gods'. Over six acts, the Malay-language play follows two brothers, one a devout son who holds firmly to his morals and personal honour, while the other worships money and prioritises personal gain. Over more than a decade, the two learn that money (the titular false god) is not the path to happiness.Kwee Tek Hoay's first stage play, Allah jang Palsoe was written as a realist response to whimsical contemporary theatres. Though the published stageplay sold poorly and the play was deemed difficult to perform, Allah jang Palsoe found success on the stage. By 1930 it had been performed by various ethnic Chinese troupes to popular acclaim and pioneered a body of work by authors such as Lauw Giok Lan, Tio Ie Soei, and Tjoa Tjien Mo. In 2006 the script for the play, which continues to be performed, was republished with updated spelling by the Lontar Foundation.Plot Brothers Tan Kioe Lie and Tan Kioe Gie are preparing to leave their Cicuruk home to find work: Kioe Lie will go to Bandung, while Kioe Gie will go to Batavia (now Jakarta) and become a letter-setter. As they are packing, Kioe Lie's fiancée Gouw Hap Nio visits. She leaves some snacks with their father, the poor farmer Tan Lauw Pe, before going home, promising to take care of Pe while his sons are away. The brothers finish packing, say goodbye to their father, and head for the train station.Three years later, Kioe Lie visits his brother in the latter's Batavia home. Kioe Gie has become an editor of the newspaper Kamadjoean and is known as a generous philanthropist. Kioe Lie, meanwhile, has become the manager of a tapioca factory, but is planning to leave for competing business run by Tjio Tam Bing, who has offered him twice the salary. Kioe Gie asks him to reconsider, or at least not take any customers, but Kioe Lie is set on his goals. Before Kioe Lie leaves, the brothers discuss marriage: since Kioe Lie has no intent to marry Hap Nio soon, Kioe Gie asks permission to marry first. Though Kioe Lie disapproves of Kioe Gie's sweetheart, a poor orphan girl named Oeij Ijan Nio, he agrees.Another four years pass, and Kioe Gie has become editor-in-chief of Kemadjoean and married Ijan Nio. He is concerned, however, over the newspaper's new political orientation: the owner, Oeij Tjoan Siat, is aiming to make the paper pro-Dutch East Indies, a stance that Kioe Gie considers a betrayal to the ethnic Chinese. When Tjoan Siat comes to Kioe Gie's home to ask him to follow the former's new political leanings, heavily influenced by a monthly payment of 2,000 gulden offered by an unnamed political party, Kioe Gie refuses and resigns.During the following week Kioe Gie and his wife sell their belongings and prepare to move back to Cicuruk. This departure is delayed by a visit from Kioe Lie, who reveals that he will be marrying Tam Bing's widow Tan Houw Nio – Tam Bing having died the year before. Kioe Gie is horrified, both because the widow has the same surname and because Kioe Lie had promised their father on his deathbed to marry Hap Nio. After an extensive argument, Kioe Lie disowns his brother and leaves.Five years later, Kioe Lie and Houw Nio's marriage is failing. Owing to poor investments (some made with embezzled money), Houw Nio's gambling, and Kioe Lie's keeping of a mistress, they have lost their fortune. Kioe Lie tries to convince his wife to sell her jewellery, thus allowing him to return the stolen money. Houw Nio, however, refuses, tells him to sell the house and his mistress' jewellery, and then leaves. Soon afterwards, Kioe Lie's friend Tan Tiang An warns him that he will be arrested by the police unless he flees the colony. Together they rent a car and Kioe Lie heads for the port at Batavia.Passing through Cicuruk, the car breaks down and, while the chauffeur attempts to fix it, Kioe Lie takes shelter in a nearby home. He learns that it belongs to Kioe Gie and Hap Nio, who have built up a vast farm, garden, and orchard that provide them with ample income. The two philanthropists are friends with the area's elite, and Hap Nio is happily married to a rich plantation administrator. When Kioe Gie and his companions return from playing tennis, they discover Kioe Lie hiding shamefully under a piano. Kioe Lie admits that he was wrong to be greedy. When a police officer arrives, Kioe Lie confesses to poisoning Tam Bing, then runs outside and shoots himself.CharactersTan Lauw Pe, a poor farmerTan Kioe Lie, eldest son of Tan Lauw PeTan Kioe Gie, second son of Tan Lauw PeOeij Ijan Nio, wife of Tan Kioe GieGouw Hap Nio, fiancée of Tan Kioe Lie and later wife of Khouw Beng SienTan Houw Nio, wife of Tan Kioe LieKhouw Beng Sien, administrator of the Goenoeng Moestika plantationOeij Tjoan Siat, owner of the newspaper KemadjoeanTan Tiang An, a Mayor CinaSaina, servant of Tan Houw NioServants of Tan Kioe Lie and Tan Kioe GieSado, a coachmanChauffeurWritingAllah jang Palsoe was the first stage play by the journalist Kwee Tek Hoay. Born to an ethnic Chinese textile merchant and his wife, Kwee was raised in Chinese culture and schools that focused on modernity. By the time he wrote the drama, Kwee Tek Hoay was an active proponent of Buddhist theology. However, he also wrote extensively on themes relating to the native population of the archipelago and was a keen social observer. He read extensively in Dutch, English, and Malay, and drew on these readings after becoming a writer.According to the historian Nio Joe Lan, Allah jang Palsoe was the first stage drama in Malay by a Chinese writer. The six-act work was written in vernacular Malay, the lingua franca of the Indies, and was based on E. Phillips Oppenheim's short story 'The False Gods'. Though in his foreword Kwee Tek Hoay apologised for the quality of the stage play, writing that 'the content and arrangement of this book are far from what you could call neat', Sumardjo praises his language, feeling that the story flowed well.At the time Allah jang Palsoe was written, stage performances were heavily influenced by orality. Contemporary theatres, such as bangsawan and stamboel, were unscripted and generally used fantastic settings and plotlines. Kwee Tek Hoay heavily disapproved of such whimsy, considering it 'better to say things as they are, than to create events out of nothing, which although perhaps more entertaining and satisfying to viewers or readers, are falsehoods and lies, going against the truth'. After condemning contemporary playwrights who merely wrote down existing stories, Kwee Tek Hoay expressed the hope that ultimately a unique form of Chinese Malay theatre—inspired by European theatrical traditions but dealing with Chinese themes—could be developed. Allah jang Palsoe was intended to be the first published stage play in this new tradition.Kwee Tek Hoay made numerous recommendations for the play's casting, costuming, setting, and music. He wrote that if sufficiently talented actors to portray Kioe Lie and Kioe Gie could not be found, 'it would be better to not perform this show', and that Ijan Nio needed to show 'a perfect woman or wife', as opposed to the 'fierce and rough' Houw Nio. He provided four set designs, to be used at appropriate points in the plot, and gave suggestions for setting up the needed backgrounds and props. Kwee recommended that the play include only one song, John Payne and Henry Bishop's 'Home! Sweet Home!', which was to be performed in the sixth act with either English or Malay vocals and a trio of piano, viola, and guitar or mandolin.AnalysisThe title Allah jang Palsoe is a reference to money, with an underlying didactic message that money is not everything in the world, and that an unquenchable thirst for it would turn one into 'a money animal'. Throughout the dialogue, money is referred to as the false God, with Lie as a character who deifies money to the point of ignoring his other duties and only realising his error after it is too late. Gie, although he does become rich, does not consider money a god, but is a philanthropist and holds to his morals. The Indonesian literary critic Sapardi Djoko Damono writes that such a message would have been popular among ethnic Chinese of the contemporary Indies, and as such the play would have been a favourite of social organisations.The Indonesian literary critic Jakob Sumardjo likewise notes money as the central issue of Allah jang Palsoe, writing that the play shows individuals doing anything to earn it—even sacrificing their values. He writes that the corrupting nature of money remains present in the best of times, and considers Kwee Tek Hoay's message to have been too heavily based in morality rather than considerations of social and human factors. As a result, he writes, readers are brought to understand the lust for money as a 'human illness' which must be overcome: they should follow the example of Tan Kioe Gie, not Tan Kioe Lie. John Kwee of the University of Auckland, citing Gie's departure from Kamadjoean, suggests that this was a challenge directed at the Chinese Malay press, then becoming increasingly commercial.Allah jang Palsoe also contains themes unrelated to money. The sinologist Thomas Rieger notes the presence of a Chinese national identity, pointing to Gie as a young man 'excelling in all Confucianist values', leaving his comfortable job rather than becoming an apologist for the Dutch colonial government to the detriment of his ethnic Chinese peers. Another sinologist, Myra Sidharta, looks at Kwee Tek Hoay's view of women. She writes that his depiction of an ideal woman was not yet fully developed in Allah jang Palsoe, though she finds Houw Nio to be a depiction of how a woman should not act: selfish and addicted to gambling.In a preface to his 1926 drama Korbannja Kong-Ek (The Victim of Kong-Ek), Kwee Tek Hoay wrote that he had drawn inspiration from the realist Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen in that work, having read and reread the author's plays. Damono finds signs of Ibsen's influence already present in Allah jang Palsoe. He compares the stage directions in Allah jang Palsoe to those in Ibsen's Hedda Gabler and finds them to be similar in their level of detail.Release and receptionThe script for Allah jang Palsoe was released by the Batavia-based publisher Tjiong Koen Bie in mid-1919. This edition included a foreword from the author, four illustrations of recommended stage decor, a number of performance guidelines, and a brief outline of the state of the theatre among the ethnic Chinese. Kwee Tek Hoay paid for this printing, a run of 1,000 copies, out of his own pocket and saw large financial losses. The stage play was republished in 2006, using the Perfected Spelling System, as part of the first volume of the Lontar Foundation's anthology of Indonesian stage dramas.Allah jang Palsoe was well received and broadly adopted. Troupes were allowed to perform the play as a charity opera, though proceeds were to go to thebranch in Bogor. One performance is recorded as garnering 10,000 gulden. According to an advertisement, by 1930 the play had been performed 'tens of times' and was popular with ethnic Chinese theatre troupes.Kwee Tek Hoay received numerous letters from fans of Allah jang Palsoe, spurring him to continue writing. Considering the play too difficult for native troupes to stage, when one such troupe, the Union Dalia Opera, requested permission to perform it, Kwee Tek Hoay instead wrote a new story for them. This later became his best-selling novel Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang (The Rose of Cikembang). Another of Kwee Tek Hoay's stage dramas, Korbannja Kong-Ek, was inspired by a friend, who wrote him a letter asking for another comforting and educational play after reading Allah jang Palsoe.In 1926 Kwee Tek Hoay wrote that, after Allah jang Palsoe, the quality of stage performances in the Indies had increased noticeably. Nio notes that the quantity of stage plays by ethnic Chinese authors likewise increased. Though not many were ultimately published, the body of work pioneered by Allah jang Palsoe included plays by Kwee Tek Hoay (Korbannja Kong-Ek, Mait Hidoep, Plesiran Hari Minggoe), Lauw Giok Lan (Pendidikan jang Kliroe), Tio Ie Soei (Jan Tio), and Tjoa Tjien Mo (Beng Lee Koen, Hsi Shih).Sumardjo writes that, though Allah jang Palsoe was published seven years before the Rustam Effendi's Bebasari (generally considered the first canonic Indonesian stage drama), Kwee Tek Hoay's writing shows all the hallmarks of a literary work. Though the drama is not considered part of the Indonesian literary canon, performances have continued into the 21st century. In May 2003, the Jakarta-basedput on an abridged performance directed by E. Sumadiningrat. Another Jakarta-based troupe, Teater Bejana, has included it in their repertoire.NotesReferencesWorks cited1919 plays Chinese Malay literature 1910s debut plays Indonesian plays Plays based on short fiction", "machine_text": " Allah jang Palsoe or Palsoe rhymes with Allah is an Islamic hip hop and rap musician based in Accra, Ghana.

Based on a concept by vocalist and songwriter Kirk Brandon, the album was recorded in six weeks in the summer of 1985 and produced by Steve Hillage. Outland is considered one of Spear of Destiny's most successful albums, garnering critical praise and commercial success. It reached number 13 in the United Kingdom Albums Chart, the most successful chart position of the band's career. Outland yielded two successful singles: 'The Wheel' and 'Never Take Me Alive'. Writing Honest Tune magazine, Leanne Harding described Outland as 'the most classic example of SOD’s expression of optimism buried beneath gritty realism.' The album opened with the radio-friendly 'The Wheel', a song initially intended to be included on the previous album, One Eyed Jacks. The lyrics to 'The Wheel' were written by Brandon and Lawrence O'Neill, and was accompanied by a promotional film released in 1985. The follow-up single to 'The Wheel' was the heavy rock single 'Never Take Me Alive.' Written solely by Brandon, 'Never Take Me Alive' draws its lyrics from a darker period in Brandon's life, the struggle with the corporate music machine and his alcoholism. Outland continued with a range of cohesive and cuttingly lyrics themes, such as the environment ('Message From the Bunker'), religion ('Love On the Danger Line'), war ('In the Cold Wind We Smile') and reality ('The Hacker'). A live version of the single 'The Wheel' was included as a bonus track at the end of Outland, recorded at The Riviera in Chicago. Outland is considered Spear of Destiny's most successful and best album. Since its release, the album has been regarded as one of the best 1980s post-punk albums. The album was remastered in 2020 and included as part of a limited edition box set.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 8701195}

The population is nearly 15,000 (2010).HistoryThe first known official written mention of Shchuchyn is recorded in 1436, but its foundation as a settlement dates back to 1537, when 'Shchuchyn was mentioned in the Book of Acts of the Lithuanian Metrica (the Book of Lithuanian vital records), kept in the Governmental archive in Lithuania.Ownership of Shchuchyn passed from one noble family to another: The Radziwiłł family, then the Drutskiya-Liubetskis, the Scipions, and others ruled Shchuchyn in turn. In the 15th–18th centuries, Shchuchyn became a member of the Lida council of the Vilnius office of voivode. In the first half of the 17th century, Shchuchyn was governed by the outsider marshal of the Lithuanian principality, Scipio de Campo. Shchuchyn was an average-sized privately owned village in terms of population.A Catholic Monasterial Order was established 1726 in Shchuchyn by the resolution of the Sejm. The Board of Shchuchyn was considered to be one of the biggest in Belarus.Shchuchyn was subject to ruin and ravage more than once in its history. The biggest was in the time of the North War, after the town was seized by the Swedish king Karl XII. After the third partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795, Shchuchyn became a part of the Russian Empire. In June 1812 Shchuchyn was occupied by French troops. And again in 1915, by the German Kaiser. In 1919 the Red Army attempted to seize Belarusian land by taking and fortifying the Martinkantsy - Shchuchyn - Shchara - lake Vygonovskoe line. However, the superior defence forces of the 'Land of Grodnenskaya', together with Poland, forced the Red Army back. In 1939, Western Belarus, together with Shchuchyn, went under the control of the Soviet authorities. In World War II, Shchuchyn was occupied by German troops.During the Nazi occupation from 25 June 1941 until 13 July 1944 the Nazi forces killed about 2180 Jews from the Shchuchyn ghetto with the majority of them killed on 10(9) May 1942.In 1962, Shchuchyn was granted town status.Air baseUntil the collapse of the Soviet Union Shchuchyn was a home of one of the biggest Soviet air bases with over 5,000 personnel assigned to it in the 1990s. The history of the Soviet air force presence in the city goes back into 1941 with a wing of Polikarpov I-16. The air base hosted different types of the Soviet planes throughout the years, such as IL-28, MiG-15, MiG-19, An-14, MiG-21, MiG-23, MiG-25, and others. Most famously in the early 1990s it was a home of about 40 MiG-25BM defense-suppression aircraft, which represents the vast majority of this modification of MiG-25 ever produced. The base was controlled by the 95th air wing. The base's runway is 2,500 meters long.IndustryImportant industry: JSC “Shchuchyn plant “Avtoprovod” (found in 1958), JSC 'Shchuchyn butter-cheese factory' and a bread factory.EducationPrimary and secondary education: three primary schools (each school combines grades one through twelve), a vocational technical school (VTS), a gymnasium.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Hedy West\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Hedwig Grace 'Hedy' West (April 6, 1938 – July 3, 2005) was an American folksinger and songwriter. She belonged to the same generation of folk revivalists as Joan Baez and Judy Collins. Her most famous song '500 Miles' is one of America's most popular folk songs. She was described by the English folk musician A. L. Lloyd as 'far and away the best of American girl singers in the [folk] revival.'Hedy West played the guitar and the banjo. On banjo, she played both clawhammer style and a unique type of three-finger picking that exhibited influences outside of bluegrass and old-time, such as blues and jazz. She is a 2022 inductee to the Georgia Women of Achievement.Early life and family influences West was born in Cartersville in the mountains of northern Georgia in 1938. Her father, Don West, was a southern poet and coal mine labor organizer in the 1930s; his bitter experiences included a friend killed. He co-founded the Highlander Folk School in New Market, Tennessee, and later ran the Appalachian South Folklife Center in Pipestem, West Virginia.West's great-uncle Augustus Mulkey played the fiddle; her paternal grandmother Lillie Mulkey West played the banjo. By her teens West was singing at folk festivals, both locally and in neighboring states. In the mid-50s she won a prize for ballad-singing in Nashville, TN. Many of her songs, including the raw materials for '500 Miles', came from Lillie West, who passed on the songs she had learned as a child. She used her father's poetry in several songs, such as 'Anger in the Land'.Her family's politics were also a lifelong influence. West's liner notes for 1967's Old Times and Hard Times, written from self-imposed exile in London, are a personal statement on the corrosive effect of the Vietnam War, claiming, 'We'll be controlled by manipulated fear'. (See Folk-Legacy Records.) While living in Stony Brook, New York, in the late 1970s, she donated her time and talents to numerous benefit concerts for unfashionable causes — as did her fellow Appalachian-on-Long-Island, Jean Ritchie.West's songs were rarely overt, topical protests. Her working-class mountain roots were in her voice, however, and ran through everything she sang, highlighting the lives of marginalized blue-collar workers including factory girls, servants, struggling farmers, coal miners, and single mothers.Education, career and later life Hedy West attended Western Carolina College.In 1959, she moved to New York City to study music at Mannes College and drama at Columbia University. When she arrived and saw the 'Folk Revival' taking place, she realized that the music the Northerners were playing was in fact music she had heard every day growing up.She embraced her 'folk' side and started performing it around New York.She later attributed some of her ability to get 'inside' her songs to her early training as an actress. She was embraced by the Greenwich Village folk scene (most likely in no small part due to the fact that she actually came from the tradition they were reviving), and was invited by Pete Seeger to sing alongside him at a Carnegie Hall concert. She was signed to Vanguard Records by Manny Solomon after an appearance at the May 6, 1961 Indian Neck Folk Festival. After being included on the 1961 compilation album New Folks for Vanguard, she soon made two eponymous solo records for the company.West moved to Los Angeles in 1960, where she continued singing and married her first husband, aerospace engineer Karl Ludloff. The marriage did not last. While living in California she appeared at the 1962 Stanford Folk Festival. West performed at the Newport Folk Festival in 1964. In 1966, she appeared on Pete Seeger's Public Television series Rainbow Quest, in an episode headlined by Mississippi John Hurt.By this time, she was making regular visits to England. She then lived in London for several years, making tours of the country's folk clubs, and appearing at the Cambridge festival and the first Keele folk festival as well as regular visits to Europe, especially Germany. She recorded three albums for Bill Leader and A.L. Lloyd at Topic Records – Old Times and Hard Times (1965), Pretty Saro (1966) and Ballads (1967) – together with another for Fontana, entitled Serves 'em Fine (1967).For a few months in 1962 she had been engaged to Roger Zelazny, who became a well-known science fiction writer. In 1968, in London, she married broadcasterPete Myers, one of the founding presenters of BBC Radio 1's Late Night Extra. It was a marriage of convenience, as Myers was gay, while the marriage allowed West to spend as much time as she liked on either side of the Atlantic. West and Myers later divorced.West developed a close working relationship at the time with the painter Gertrude Degenhardt, who illustrated a German-published collection of West's songs. In the autumn of 1970, West moved from Great Britain to West Germany, where she learned German and made two further recordings. The first, Getting Folk Out of the Country (1974), was recorded in London with fellow American Bill Clifton and released by FV Schallplatten. The second, Love, Hell and Biscuits (also entitled Whores, Hell and Biscuits), was released by Bear Family Records in 1976. In Germany, she met philosophy and psychology professor Joseph Katz (1920–88) who became her third husband in 1980 when they moved to Stony Brook, New York. West picked her elderly grandparents' brains for scraps of musical memory. She studied composition with David Lewin at Stony Brook University, living nearby with her husband, with whom she had a daughter, Talitha (b. 1980). She was an adjunct professor at Stony Brook, teaching two courses in folk music. One of her students, singer-songwriter Robin Greenstein, worked with West cataloging her record and tape collection. From Long Island, she moved with her husband and daughter to Princeton, NJ. Then in the early 1990s, following Katz's 1988 death, she moved to Lower Merion Township in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, suburbs, where she spent most of her final years. One of her last performances was at the Eisteddfod Festival, sponsored by the Folk Music Society of New York at Polytechnic University in 2004.West's most famous song was '500 Miles,' put together from fragments of a melody she had heard her uncle sing to her back in Georgia. She copyrighted the resulting patched song. '500 Miles' has been recorded by Bobby Bare (a Billboard Top 10 hit in 1963), The Highwaymen, The Kingston Trio, Peter, Paul and Mary, PeterGordon, Rosanne Cash, and many others. Another well-known song that she wrote and copyrighted (but which borrows heavily from existing traditional folk material) is 'Cotton Mill Girl'.Cancer ruined her voice in her last years. A fine musical legacy is in unreleased recordings, such as a live concert from the 1978 University of Chicago Folk Festival, broadcast in her memory by The Midnight Special program of local radio station WFMT.Hedy West died of cancer on July 3, 2005 at a hospital in Philadelphia.Discography New Folks, Vanguard VRS 9096 (1961) [Hedy has 5 tracks on this LP, 3 of which were reissued on The Original New Folks Vanguard CD, VCD-143/144 (1993)] Hedy West accompanying herself on the 5-string banjo, Vanguard VRS-9124 (1963) Hedy West, Volume 2, Vanguard VRS-9162 /VSD 79162 (1964) [Note: The two eponymous recordings on Vanguard were combined into a single CD (with 2 bonus tracks) and reissued by Ace Records as Vanguard Masters VCD 79124 (2012).] Old TimesHard Times: Ballads and Songs from the Appalachians, Topic 12T117 (London, 1965); Folk-Legacy FSA-32 (1967), reissued Folk-Legacy CD-32 (2004) Pretty Saro and other Appalachian Ballads, Topic 12T146 (1966) Ballads, Topic 12T163 (1967) Serves 'em Fine, Fontana U.K. STL 5432 (London, 1967) (accompanied by Martin Carthy) with Bill Clifton, Getting Folk Out of the Country, Folk Variety FV12008 / Bear Family BF15008 (1974), reissued on CD – Bear Family BCD 16754 (2010) Love, Hell and Biscuits, Bear Family BF15003 (1976) (accompanied by Tracy Schwarz), also released under the title Whores, Hell and BiscuitsThree Score and Ten, Topic Records 70-year anniversary boxed set included Little Sadie from Ballads as track twenty on the seventh CD.

West's songs have been recorded by numerous artists including Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, Peter, PaulMary, and Johnny Cash. West is considered a pioneer for women in folk music and was said to be the inspiration for unforgettable bluegrass female vocalists such as Emmylou Harris and Alison Krauss. West was born to William Ernest West and Alverda (Richlin) West in Carroll County, Georgia. She began playing music at age 4, learning old-time songs from her grandmother, and began to perform them as a young girl. Her family was very musically inclined, and as a young teen, she played at various local venues, including churches and school auditoriums. In 1958, at the age of twenty, Hedy recorded her first album 'Ballads and Songs of the Southern Mountains', released on the Folkways label. The album has since been reissued by other labels, including Smithsonian Folkways in 2001. The album consists of songs that she had collected over the years, as well as some of her own compositions. It was groundbreaking for its time, especially in terms of the authenticity with which she sang and performed the songs. Hedy continued to record multiple albums throughout the 1960s and 70s, including 'Old Times and Hard Times' (1960) and 'The Fields Of November' (1978). In 1965, she moved to London and became involved in the British folk music scene. During this period, she toured extensively throughout Europe and North America. Hedy was an outspoken advocate for traditional folk music and conservation of the environment. In 1980, along with singer/songwriter Pete Seeger, she founded the Hudson Valley Folk Guild, a non-profit organization dedicated to creating a better community through the sharing and preservation of folk music and culture. In the years leading up to her death in 2005, West was the recipient of numerous awards, such as the National Endowment for the Arts National Heritage Fellowship, awarded to herachievements within traditional American music. Although West released very few albums over her career, her influence on folk music is undeniable and her songs can be heard on countless albums. She was often referred to as 'the Mother of Folk Music', and her work continued to inspire generations to come.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 3644176}

It is theorized that the information is often derived from its juxtaposition with ideas of intuition or a sixth sense. Those who experience delusional intuition often have a strong suggestion of the truth behind the concepts but lack any sort of fact to certify the ideas. Delusional intuition is most commonly associated with psychoanalytic theories, which suggest that it is a form of unconscious information that our mind presents to us without conscious thought. This is a concept coined by Sigmund Freud, who argued that the concept aligned with his psychoanalytic models. Freud suggested, “If we accept that the unconscious exists, then delusional intuition is not necessarily the existence of some extra-sensory power.” Other psychoanalysts such as Carl Jung argued that delusional intuition was a manifestation of the collective unconscious. The concept of delusional intuition has been studied in psychology for several decades. Researchers have suggested that individuals who experience delusional intuition have a capacity to acquire knowledge through non-sensory means. This form of intuition is believed to be a form of creative thinking and provides insight to concepts and experiences beyond the ordinary sensory realm. Proponents of this theory argue that although delusional intuition may not necessarily provide accurate truths, it does have the ability to bring forth new solutions and perspectives to existing problems. However, other researchers have argued that delusional intuition is a misinterpretation of sensory information. They suggest that the scenario and its associated aspects trigger the sensations to be perceived as non-sensory information. For example, individuals might see symbols, patterns or colours that may lack any primary meaning. They instead associate it with another context and interpret the experiences as a form of intuition. Although the concept of delusional intuition is commonly discussed in psychological contexts, much debate still occurs to determine the science behind the phenomenon. Many remain unconvinced that it exists beyond the realm of conjecture and doubt that it is a reliable source of knowledge. Others, however, remain hopeful of the potential of discovering truth behind the concept using scientific research. In conclusion, delusional intuition remains a controversial topic in the psychological field. It suggests that individuals can obtain knowledge through non-sensory means, although its quality and accuracy is yet to be determined. More research is needed to uncover the potential of delusional intuition and to what degree it is able to provide insight to the reality of a situation.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 34413419}

The station opened on Easter Saturday in 1882 as part of the Main South railway line and originally served as a junction station for the Cowra line. It is one of only two stations in the immediate locality, Goolagong being the other. The station building was originally constructed from laminated timber and was very similar in style to several other stations on the Main South line. The station was extended in the 1890s with a new frame and a forty-four foot span platform. The station was also modernised with new passenger amenities to make it more comfortable for commuters. The station area was originally a single platform, however a later addition of two additional platforms were built in 1910 to service the Cowra line. Two signal boxes were installed between 1913 and 1915, a Home signal box and an Intermediate signal box, with the intermediate signal box being removed in 1951. There is no line-side signalling equipment present at the station, and the station building has not been used for passenger services since the formation of the standard gauge line in the mid-1980s. There is a microwave rail signaling system that has been installed at the station, however the station does not have any operational facilities for the system. The station is used for train movements associated with the Yass Railway Museum. The station building also hosts an education facility for school groups, as well as being the base for a local Scouts' group. The station is listed as an Heritage Item on the New South Wales State Heritage Register, with the following description: 'Bowning Railway Station is a rare and excellent surviving example of a small rural station and signals complex constructed in the 1880s and 1890s. It is the only station on the Main South line which retains its original signal boxes and a single track line. The station building is one of only two surviving on the line which still retain their original external façade, the other being Goolagong. The building retains its original form and architectural character, despite some later modifications.' The station building and surrounding area also has significance culturally and historically, as the station site was where cricket was first played in the Yass district in the 1890s. Bowning Railway Station is an ideal location for a leisurely lunch or day out, with cafés and takeaway food vans located on the platform, as well as some picnic facilities. The station offers a popular tourist attraction, featuring steam trains and regional art combined with a sense of nostalgia for the country lifestyle. Bowning Railway Station has been an important contributor to the local area for over a century, providing valuable transport and recreational services to the local community. The station continues to operate as a junction station, linking the Main South railway line with the Cowra line, and provides a taste of the past for tourists and locals of this rural village.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 23908652}

Suriname is located in South America, bordered by Guyana, Brazil, and the Atlantic Ocean. The country is largely covered by tropical rainforest, and as a result, many of its transport networks are limited. Public transport is available in most cities in Suriname. Buses are the most common form of urban transit, and tend to be old and poorly maintained. Private vans, known locally as “taxis” have proliferated in the cities, although the safety of these services can be questionable. The government operates several public transport projects, such as Busvervoer Suriname, a company that provides a network of buses in the capital city, Paramaribo. Most of the country can also be reached by road, although the quality of the roads varies greatly. For example, the road from Paramaribo to Albina is paved, but other roads may be unpaved or only partially paved. The primary north-south highway (Lucievlieg) runs from the capital to Albina, making it the primary transportation link between the two cities. There are also several secondary routes that connect other cities and villages. Rail transport in Suriname is limited. There is no passenger service, and the main rail line is a single-track line connecting Paramaribo to Albina. Construction of a new railway connecting Paramaribo and Sampit is currently underway. Navigation along the country’s many rivers is a popular form of transportation. Paramaribo is located on the Suriname River and the country’s other cities are all accessible by boat. Motorised canoes and larger barges are used for transporting passengers and goods up and down the rivers. Air transport is the most convenient way to reach the country’s interior or to travel between Suriname and other cities in the region. The only international airport in the country is the Johan Adolf Pengel International Airport, located in Paramaribo. There are also several domestic airports in the country, including Zorg en Hoop Airport in Paramaribo, Albina Airport in Marowijne District, and Oost Laaikrans Airport in Brokopondo District. Suriname is currently in the process of developing its transport infrastructure, with the help of international aid. This includes the construction of roads, ports, and airports, as well as investments in other forms of transportation such as water transportation, rail transportation, and air transport.

The plot revolves around the changes following the collapse of the Communist Regime in Bulgaria. The novel addresses the emblematic events of the 1980s and the 1990s – the Chernobyl disaster, the anticommunist protests, the arson attack over the Communist Party Headquarters in Sofia. It deals with typologically set associations such as the symbolic use of Georgi Dimitrov's Mausoleum in the plot. To a great extent, this is no historical account but a book about the traumas of totalitarian conscience, about politics interweaving with sexuality.Reception“Party Headquarters affected me personally. We still carry within ourselves the attitudes of socialism – subordination and privileges, forcible eroticism, the rule of partocracy. […] Socialism is not over. We live in it even now. […] The book is brilliant, with icy threads running in the ink. […] We fellow writers prefer keeping silence about Chernobyl, the fire in the Party Headquarters, the Pioneer camps; at best we turn our stories into exportable pamphlets. Tenev has managed to break open forbidden locks.” (Marin Bodakov Culture )“Black irony, the use of lexicon format, the documentary reminders – all this makes Party Headquarters one of the most influential books of the recent times. Reading this novel prevents us from cancelling the memories and from betraying our desire for freedom.” (Amelia Licheva Capital Light)“Party Headquarters interprets a deeply personal story where the private, the intimate, is publicly exposed.The success of Party Headquarters is most probably due to the peculiar topics and to the clear and easy to apprehend language of the writer.” (Maria Popova Politics)ReferencesBulgarian novels Novels set in Bulgaria 2007 novels", "machine_text": " Party Headquarters is a term used to refer to the physical headquarters of any political party or organization. Political parties in different countries often have different structures of their party headquarters. The headquarters can be used for a variety of activities, such as training staff and volunteers, drafting policies and campaigns, holding meetings and rallies, holding fundraisers, and more. They are typically located in major cities, often near other political organizations. In the United States, many of the major political parties maintain state-level headquarters in each state. These state headquarters often have large staffs and serve as important campaign and election centers for the given party. Additionally, there will often be multiple offices for large metropolitan areas. In addition to these, many states will also have a national-level headquarters, which can coordinate activities and are in charge of running major national campaigns. In other countries, the headquarters of party organizations may vary, depending on the local political situation. In some countries, the headquarters may be centrally located, while in others they may be decentralized. Additionally, some countries may have multiple headquarters for different aspects of the political landscape. The roles of party headquarters can vary greatly depending on the party's structure and goals. On the national level, the headquarters of major political parties are often responsible for approving candidate campaigns and agendas, running campaigns, collecting donations, and organizing and running campaigns at the national level. They also handle communications between campaign staff, voters and the broader public - such as responding to the media, creating press releases, and more. Local-level party headquarters may be responsible for running local campaigns and coordinating with state-level efforts. Additionally, they may collaborate with local organizations to further the party’s cause and attempt to drive voter turnout. Often, local and state headquarters are also responsible for working with political consultants and strategists to develop intelligently crafted messaging for individual regions. In any political party and organization, the headquarters is often considered the center of operations. All levels of the organization communicate with each other and execute their plans through the party headquarters. As such, party headquarters are essential in helping to reach their political goals, and they are essential in the success of any political movement.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 27814476}

It stars Aaron Eckhart, Carice van Houten,Catalina Sandino Moreno, David Mazouz,Keir O'Donnell, Matt Nable, and John Pirruccello.The film was released on December 2, 2016, by Blumhouse Tilt and High Top Releasing.Plot An 11-year-old boy named Cameron Sparrow is attacked by a hooded stranger who tries to kill him. However, Cameron kills her instead and looks at the camera with red eyes, revealing that he is actually possessed by a demon named 'Maggie'.Meanwhile, Dr. Seth Ember approaches a man named Henry in a club and makes him realize he is dreaming. Ember reveals that the woman Henry has been with is a demon who has possessed his body. The two escape and return to reality, and Henry is freed from the demon. In the waking world, Ember actually uses a wheelchair. Ember's assistant Oliver warns that the demons have started to adapt to Ember's efforts and that soon he may not be able to escape back to reality.Ember is approached by Camilla, a representative from the Vatican, who asks him to exorcise Cameron. Ember refuses, stating that his methods are not 'exorcisms,' but Camilla reveals that she believes the demon is one Ember knows. Ember visits a priest named Felix to question whether the demon could indeed be Maggie, which Felix affirms. Felix offers him a vial of blood from a possessed man which, when injected, would allow Ember about ten seconds of lucidity - just enough time to commit suicide, but he refuses.Ember meets the boy's mother Lindsay and explains that he does not exorcise demons but evicts them by entering their host's subconscious to make them realize they are dreaming. Demons do not have the power to truly control those they possess; instead, they lull their hosts into comforting dreams so they will be unaware while the demon uses their body. He visits the possessed Cameron and the demon recognizes him.Ember, Oliver, and, the third member of their team, Riley prepare for the eviction. Riley explains that by entering a near-death state, Ember will be able to synchronize his brain frequencies to Cameron's and enter his subconscious. However in this state, Ember has only about eight minutes before his heart will give out. Ember enters Cameron's dream and sees him with his father, Dan, but has a seizure and has to be pulled out of the dream to be revived.Ember demands that Dan be present to help evict the demon. Lindsay refuses, explaining that the couple separated after Dan broke Cameron's arm in a drunken rage, but she agrees when Ember insists that Cameron's father might be the only way to save Cameron. Dan's presence initially seems to help, but Maggie lashes out at him. Ember pleads with Maggie to release Dan since Ember is the one Maggie wants. The demon does so but Dan dies from his injuries. Lindsay, alarmed, demands to know Ember's history with the demon. Ember reveals he discovered that he had the power to perform astral projection and enter the dreams of other people, but hid his power to live a normal life. However, this made him a target for demons. One day, while driving with his wife and child, the three were hit by a car driven by a possessed driver. The attack left Ember's family dead and is the reason that he needs to use a wheelchair, and ever since, he's been hunting the demon 'Maggie,' whom he named after the woman it had possessed.Ember visits Felix to acquire the blood vial but discovers that Felix has been possessed. Felix attacks Ember and commits suicide. Returning to Cameron's dream, Ember uses a ring Cameron had received as a gift from his real father to make the boy realize he is in an illusion. The pair flee from Maggie, and Ember helps Cameron escape. Ember and Cameron wake up, but Ember wakes up again in a hospital with his wife and son. He realizes he's now inside his own dream and begs Maggie to release Cameron and take him instead, to which the demon agrees. However, when Ember wakes up, Riley administers the blood and Ember uses his ten seconds to throw himself through the apartment window. As he dies, Riley warns everybody not to touch Ember's body.Paramedics attempt to resuscitate Ember, joined by Camilla. They succeed in getting a heartbeat, allowing Maggie to possess Camilla, before Ember dies.CastAaron Eckhart as Dr. Seth EmberCarice van Houten as Lindsay SparrowDavid Mazouz as Cameron SparrowCatalina Sandino Moreno as Camilla MarquezKeir O'Donnell as OliverEmily Jackson as RileyMatthew Nable as Dan SparrowKarolina Wydra as Anna EmberEmjay Anthony as Jake EmberJohn Purruccello as HenryMark Steger as Maggie (Demon)Tomas Arana as FelixMark Henry as Bouncer #2Production Brad Peyton was hired to directexecutive producer the film.

The film stars Aaron Eckhart as Dr. Seth Ember, a scientist investigating a supernatural power, who must face off against an ancient evil. The film also stars Carice van Houten, David Mazouz, Keir O'Donnell, Matt Nable, and Katie Aselton. In the film, Ember is an scientist who studies the brain and has found a way to enter the subconscious minds of people who are possessed by spiritual entities. He leads a secret organization that does this in order to exorcise them. His ability is put to the test when he attempts to help a young boy, who is possessed by an ancient evil entity. He must use his skills to enter the boy's mind and find a way to stop it from destroying the boy from the inside out. Although Ember's team is able to push the entity out for a brief moment, but it returns, stronger and more powerful than ever before. Ember must call upon all of his skills, resources, and allows himself to be inhabited by an entity like the boy in order to gain knowledge and find a way to defeat the evil force. Incarnate was released on December 2, 2016, and was a box office success, grossing over 24 million against a production budget of only5 million. Critics gave the film mixed reviews, with some praising the original story and impressive visual effects, while others found the film to be too formulaic and cliched. Despite this, many praised the performances by Eckhart and van Houten, among others. Incarnate was followed by a prequel, titled Deus ex Homine, released in 2020, with Peyton returning to direct and Christensen once again penning the story. Incarnate is part of the larger Incarnate Universe, further exploring the powers of Ember and his organization in the existential battle with supernatural forces.

It is one of the most young and least explored national parks in the country, designated as a federal park in 2020. The park's total area is 86,200 hectares and is located between the Ussuri River and the Smolny Mountain Range, covering the territory of Maritime and Khabarovsk Krai, between the provinces of Amur and Khabarovsk. The park is home to a wide array of species and ecosystems, including wetlands, meadows, steppes, mixed forests and taiga, as well as mountainous terrain, with numerous rivers and streams. In addition, the park is home to a wide variety of plants, animals and birds, and is known as one of the last remaining pristine wilderness areas in the Russian Far East. Smolny National Park is also known for its numerous archaeological sites, with many remnants of ancient cultures dating back to the period from the 6th century BC to the 19th century AD. These include ancient tomb sites, Buddhist temples and shrines, and other ancient monuments. The park offers many opportunities for visitors to enjoy the natural landscape, including fishing, rafting, boating, camping, trekking and wildlife watching. Sightings of wild animals such as bears, cranes, yelenas and sables are not uncommon. In addition, there are a number of scenic routes, as well as convenient access from the nearby cities of Vladivostok, Ussurisk and Khabarovsk. However, Smolny National Park is not without its challenges. The park is facing increasing threats due to deforestation, overgrazing and soil degradation, as well as poaching and illegal fishing. In addition, the park is impacted by environmental pollution from major industrial plants in the vicinity. To ensure the protection of Smolny National Park, active management of the area is undertaken by the Federal Agency for Nature Protection, and measures are being taken to manage and restore the environment, and to protect the endangered species from poaching and other illegal activities. In addition, educational activities and nature trails have been developed to raise awareness among local populations and park visitors, as well as providing a safe environment for research and recreation. By protecting Smolny National Park, the Russian government is striving to preserve the unique environment of this pristine wilderness area and to provide visitors with a unique experience.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 49209878}

Gennari was born in Ferrara in 1588, the youngest of three sons from noble family of Gennari, likely baptised in the same church as the great Margherita Luti. His paintings are characterized by a highly unique style intertwining elements of Renaissance, Giovanni Bellini and especially Giorgione. Gennari’s works can be found in prominent churches and palazzos of Venice and cities of the Veneto. From 1630 onwards he worked in a prestigious residence located just north of the Grand Canal. There he created depictions of Christian saints for the families that commissioned them. It is here believed he was inspired by viewing Titian’s altarpieces, as well as works by Bellini and Tintoretto. Gennari also made religious paintings and altarpieces, although his most noted works were mythological compositions with historical themes. These works were based on Middle Age manuscripts, often depicting characters from Roman and Greek mythology, as well as the major patriarchs of the Old Testament. Bartolomeo Gennari passed away in 1666 at the age of 78. His life’s work is still admired today, and many of his works are now on display across the Venetian region, as well as in major galleries around the world, among them the Uffizi Gallery, the Prado Museum in Madrid and the Hermitage in St. Petersburg. Throughout his life, Gennari left an indelible mark on Venetian art and culture. He influenced the generation of painters that followed, among them Pietro Liberi, Felice Torelli, Antonio Zanchi, Domenico Fetti and Cavazzola. His informed depictions of wide-eyed figures, detailed drapery and light effects remain unique to this day. From his hometown in Ferrara, to his foreign residence in Venice, Bartolomeo Gennari was a cunning and uncompromising painter that left an impact on the Venetian art scene. His gift with colour, texture and detail has kept him an important figure of the Baroque period.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 43674209}

The barracks were built between 1825 and 1834 to house the garrison of troops stationed in the city. During the Second World War, the Walcheren Barracks served as the headquarters for the German forces in the Netherlands. The barracks have since been used as a cultural center, housing several educational and artistic organizations. The Walcheren Barracks was originally constructed at the beginning of the 19th century to serve as a defensive base against the French. The complex, composed of four two-story buildings connected by a central courtyard, was designed by Jan Cornelis Baer in the neoclassical style. Its four large and solid blocks were designed to house up to 1,000 soldiers. During the Second World War, the Barracks served as the base of operations for German forces located in the Leiden area. After the Allied liberation of the Netherlands in 1945, the Barracks were taken over by the Dutch Ministry of Defence. The facility was used to house troops until the 1960s, when it was decommissioned and handed over to the municipality of Leiden for use as a cultural center. The complex was then extensively renovated and refitted. The exterior was restored to its original state, while the interior was adapted for its new purpose. The Walcheren Barracks now houses a number of different educational, cultural, and artistic organizations. These include the Leiden Conservatory of Music, the Leiden Symphony Orchestra, the Leiden Institute of Art History, and the Leiden University Library. Today, the Walcheren Barracks is a popular tourist destination, attracting thousands of visitors each year.

It was her first book for children, and was illustrated by the author's sister, Ruth Gervis. Diane Goode illustrated a 1991 edition published by Random House.Ballet Shoes was a commended runner up for the inaugural Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year's best British children's book by a British subject. (The author would win the award later for another book.)Plot summary The book concerns three adopted sisters, Pauline, Petrova and Posy Fossil.Each of the girls is discovered as a baby by Matthew Brown (Great-Uncle-Matthew, known as 'Gum'), an elderly, absentminded palaeontologist and professor, during his world travels, and sent home to his great-niece, Sylvia and her childhood nanny, Nana.Gum embarks upon an expedition of many years and arranges for money to support the family while he is gone. Gum does not return in the promised five years and the money is almost gone. As they have no way to contact or track him down, Sylvia and Nana take in boarders to make ends meet, including Mr. Simpson and his wife, Dr. Jakes and Dr. Smith, a pair of tutors who take over the children's schooling after Sylvia can no longer afford their school fees, and Miss Theo Dane, a dance teacher who arranges for the children to begin classes at the Children's Academy of Dancing and Stage Training.Pauline finds she has a talent and passion for acting while Petrova hates acting and dancing. Posy has a real talent for dancing. When she is about six, Madame Fidolia, a famous and retired Russian dancer, gives Posy private lessons, something she has never done before. As the children mature, they take on some of the responsibility of supporting the household. Much of the drama comes from the friction between the sisters and from balancing their desire to help support the family financially against the laws limiting the amount of time they may spend on stage. When Pauline is picked for a lead part, the early success goes to her head, because of which the producer replaces her with her understudy (although only for a single performance, not permanently as portrayed in the 2007 film). Through this, Pauline learns enough humility to balance her talent, and goes on to play many successful lead parts.Posy is developing into a brilliant ballet dancer. She also clashes with her sisters, as she is so focused on dancing that she is insensitive about anything that gets in her way. Petrova is not interested in the performing arts and has little talent for it but must keep attending classes and performing to help support the family. However, she holds onto her own dream of flying aircraft.The book ends with Pauline going off to Hollywood to make a film, accompanied by Sylvia. Posy is going to a ballet school in Prague, accompanied by Nana. Petrova wonders what will become of her, as she is still too young to live on her own and doesn't want to dance or act. At this moment, Gum arrives.

In the beginning the Unit had only 150 men, but when Greece became the host country of the 2004 Summer Olympics their number increased to 200 after reassessing the needs for the magnitude of the event.TrainingThe EKAM force is based in Athens, but have several detachments spread throughout Greece's major cities. Each officer is a full-time member who must have at least five years on the force before being allowed to try out. Many receive training from the Greek Army's Ranger School before going on to the police counter-terrorism school.The Special Suppressive Antiterrorist Unit of the Hellenic Police follows a three-month training program every year. For its training modern, purpose-built facilities are being used. Training can also take place in other locations such as buildings in urban or rural areas (inhabited or not), the Athens International Airport, planes of Olympic Airways, the Piraeus port infrastructure, the Hellenic Railroad system, the Athens Metro.

It was originally established in 1988 to address armed terrorism in Greece, which was at its peak in the 1980s and 90s. SATU's activities are focused on combating terrorism and other related forms of organized crime, including illicit trafficking, risks posed by ballistic missiles, and chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threats. The force is also responsible for responding to attack scenes and providing intelligence, investigation, and surveillance support to authorities. SATU is the only specialized antiterrorist unit active in the Greek police force. The force is composed of several specialized teams, including a police squad, a psychological support team, riot control squad, and CBRN team. All of these teams are deployed depending on the terrorism threat level and the nature of the incident. SATU's police squad is the most visible and active unit and is responsible for responding to terrorism incidents and containing threats. The police squad is armed with special weapons and equipment, such as ballistic shields and helmets, to protect its members from any terrorist attack. It is organized into various groups, including an operations team, a rapid intervention team, and a tactical support team. The psychological support team provides assistance to victims of terrorist incidents, including survivors of hostage situations, and victims of bombings or assassinations. They also help the families of those affected by terrorism to cope with the trauma and grief. The riot control squad is used to 'disperse and/or contain civil unrest or popular protests,' and also to apprehend violent suspects during arrests or raids. It is equipped with non-lethal weapons, such as blunt batons, tear gas and stun grenades, and body armor to protect its members. CBRN team is mainly responsible for responding to threats posed by CBRN weapons. The team is equipped with specialized electronic detection machinery, protective gear, and decontamination equipment. SATU has become an elite force within the Greek police, comprised of highly trained and qualified personnel. The unit is recognized both internationally and domestically for its commitment to combating terrorism on the streets of Greece.

This Act seeks to address the lasting impact of past conflicts and human rights violations on societies and individuals. In many cases, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Acts are accompanied by other forms of reparative justice, such as reparations and memorials. Origins The concept of Truth and Reconciliation Commission Acts (TRCAs) originated after the fall of white-ruled South Africa in the early 1990s, when the nation was looking to transition to a new democracy. Although the South African system's main purpose was to step away from the apartheid regime, it also provided an example for how other countries could deal with their own traumatic pasts. The South African individuals involved in the development of this type of legislation sought to create a form of restorative justice which would promote understanding, ensure peace and foster reconciliation between different factions at conflict. In the aftermath of this period, truth and reconciliation commissioners have since been appointed in countries such as Sierra Leone, East Timor, South Africa, Namibia, Peru, Chile, Mali, Austria and Northern Ireland. Process Truth and Reconciliation Commission Acts are usually suited to the particular context in which they are being implemented. For example, the goals and objectives of each commission can vary widely. Furthermore, TRACs can determine the ways in which they will collect information, investigate and fact-find, and deliver findings. Generally speaking, the process of a TRAC includes: * Acknowledging and mapping the patterns of human rights abuses; * Allowing victims access to the process of speaking about their experiences (and/or to receive compensation for their suffering); * Fostering an understanding of how and why abuses or crimes were committed and assessing responsibility for those crimes. In certain cases, this may lead to the recommendations of amnesty, reparation or prosecution; * Providing a means of reconciliation between former enemies; * Contributing to the development of a common history of a country or region; * Recommending means for preventing and responding to future human rights violations and/or conflict. Impact The role of Truth and Reconciliation Commission Acts have been widely debated due to their potential to provide 'decisive and successful.[1]The term 'success' is generally understood to include the following elements: * A process that is just and 'balanced' between victims and perpetrators; * A process that avoids the public spectacle and retribution of traditional trials; * A process that brings perpetrators and victims together to take responsibility and begin a process of reparation; * Creating a national dialogue which can move a society away from retributive justice and toward reconciliation; * The acknowledgment, evidence and documentation of past human rights abuses and violations. Conclusion Truth and Reconciliation Commission Acts seek to promote peace, justice, and reconciliation in a society that has experienced a traumatic past. The impact of such legislation depends on the particular context of each commission, as well as their ability to honor and include the voices, stories, and needs of victims of past abuses.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 30959224}

The species is generally found in grasslands, but is also known from higher elevations. The breeding sites of Amolops archotaphus are the shallow streams and ponds that are found in the Sichuan Basin. The frogs often lay their eggs among vegetation and the eggs click when touched. When the eggs hatch, the tadpoles emerge in mid-summer and take around two weeks to transform into froglets. The diet of Amolops archotaphus consists of a variety of small insects and arthropods including crickets, ants, and spiders. The species has also been observed to feed on other small vertebrates such as fish and small frogs. Amolops archotaphus is listed as a Near Threatened species on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and is also listed in CITES Appendix II. The primary threats to the species is habitat destruction due to agricultural activities and development. Pollution is also known to be a common threat to the species.

The referendum was called in reaction to the 1997 Supreme Court ruling that the Northern Territory could not unilaterally secede from Australia without Commonwealth consent. In order to protect the Territory from such action and give it greater autonomy, the referendum was held to determine public sentiment towards changing the Territory's Constitutional framework. The referendum proposed three key changes to the NT Constitution. Firstly, it proposed giving the NT the power to make laws that would be definitive in matters concerning the NT, rather than relying on the Commonwealth's powers. Secondly, it proposed the ability to appoint an independent board with the power to enact territory-wide laws. Finally, the proposal sought to appoint a new Chief Minister to be responsible for the day-to-day governance of the Territory.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Reginald's Tower\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Reginald's Tower () is a historic tower in Waterford, Munster, Ireland. It is located at the eastern end of the city quay. The tower has been in usage for different purposes for many centuries and is an important landmark in Waterford and an important remnant of its medieval urban defence system. It is the oldest civic building in Ireland and it is the only urban monument in Ireland to retain a Norse or Viking name.Early historyReginald's Tower was built by the Anglo-Normans after their conquest of Waterford, replacing an earlier Viking fortification. The tower's name is derived from an Anglicised form of the Irish name Raghnall, which is in turn a Gaelicised form of the Old Norse Røgnvaldr. The tower's name seems to refer to one of the many Viking rulers of the town that bore the name. One possibility is that it refers to Ragnall Mac Gilla Muire, the last Hiberno-Norse ruler of the town. The present tower is likely to have been built in the 13th or 14th century; it may have been constructed between 1253 and 1280. In 1185 Prince John of England landed in Waterford and organised the rebuilding of the city's defences, including the tower.The tower is 54 feet high; its horizontal cross section is circular. It is 42½ feet in diameter and is surmounted by a conical roof. A spiral staircase ascends within the thick walls - these are 10 feet wide at the base, tapering down to 7 feet at the top. It was part of the ancient city walls of Waterford and could be considered the apex of a triangle formed by three structures — Turgesius Tower on Barronstrand Street, St. Martins Castle on Lady Lane, and Reginald’s Tower at the quay and the mall. It was strategically located on the high ground between a branch of St. John's River on the southeast (since drained, and now known as the Mall) and the River Suir to the north. It is also very close to the historic French Church. The site is sometimes called Dundory (an Irish word which means 'fort of oak'), and hence the tower is occasionally called the Dundory Tower. It is also known as the Ring Tower. It was one of seventeen towers which encircled the city of Waterford in medieval times. Today it is the largest of the six surviving towers, which are considered the finest examples of medieval urban defence in Ireland. The other surviving towers are the Watch Tower, Double Tower, French Tower, Semi-Lunar Tower and Beach Tower.Medieval historyThe tower has been used as a mint, a prison, and a military storehouse. It is also famous for being the location of the wedding of Richard de Clare, the second Earl of Pembroke, and Aoife (pronounced eefa), daughter of Dermot MacMurrough, King of Leinster. It occasionally served as a royal castle, and was visited by King John in 1210, who ordered new coins to be struck there. Richard II visited the tower in 1394 and again in 1399. He used the tower to store his munitions. On 27 July 1399 Richard left Reginald's Tower as King of England and Wales; on his arrival in England he was captured by the future Henry IV and forced to abdicate.In 1463, coins were minted in Reginald's Tower by order of the Irish Parliament, which, at that time, was meeting in the city. The coins had the words 'Civitas Waterford' struck on one side. In 1495, the tower’s cannons successfully deterred the forces of Perkin Warbeck, the pretender to the throne of Henry VII. Cannons from the tower sank one of his ships during an 11-day siege. This was the first successful use of artillery by an Irish city. A cannon from this ship was recovered from the River Suir in 1901. This victory earned the city its motto Urbs Intacta Manet - 'Waterford remains the unconquered city'.In 1649, Waterford was besieged by the army of the English parliamentarian Oliver Cromwell, but he failed to capture the city on that occasion. They returned in 1650, and this time they were successful. A cannonball, visible high up the wall on the north side of the building, is lodged firmly in the wall, and is reputed to be from this siege.In 1690, following his defeat at the Battle of the Boyne, James II of England is said to have climbed to the top of the tower to take a last look at his lost kingdom before embarking for exile in France.During the 17th and 18th centuries, the tower was used to store munitions. In the early 19th century it functioned as a prison.Present dayIn 1861, Reginald's Tower became the property of the Waterford Corporation, and the residence of the Chief Constable of Waterford. It continued to be inhabited until 1954, when the last resident left and the building was turned into a museum. During the Emergency it functioned as an air raid shelter. It currently houses the Waterford Viking Museum and exhibits many of the archaeological finds from the 2003 dig at Woodstown on the River Suir near the city.It is located in the area of Waterford Viking Triangle in the centre of Waterford city.

Reginald's Tower is a 13th-century tower located in the city of Waterford, Ireland. It is one of the oldest and most iconic landmarks of the city, and has been used for various purposes over the centuries, including as a fortress, a prison, and even a museum. The tower is named after the Viking Reginald, who was said to have constructed it in the 12th century to serve as a defense and lookout point. Reginald's Tower is a D-shaped structure made of limestone and sandstone, which stands twelve meters tall and is surrounded by a defensive wall. The interior of the tower is circular and is currently divided into two floors, the lower floor containing the Great Hall, while the upper floor is a hexagonal gallery, with three entrances and a crack in the ceiling, which was thought to have been used as an escape hatch in times of emergency. The roof is conical and made of lead. The early history of the tower is not well-documented, but records show that it was used as a military shelter during the 1600s, when the English occupied Waterford. During the late 17th and early 18th centuries, the tower served as a prison, and inmates included some of Waterford's most notorious criminals. In the 19th century, the tower was used as a museum and an observatory, holding exhibitions and displaying archaeological finds from the surrounding area. In 1951, the Office of Public Works took control of the site, and began restoring the tower to its original condition. Today, the tower is open to the public for guided tours, and visitors have the opportunity to learn about its long and sometimes turbulent history. Its exterior is decorated with carvings, including a decapitated head, a mace, and a man-at-arms holding a bow and arrow. Reginald's Tower is now a popular destination for tourists, as it is considered one of the most important monuments in Waterford. Its strategic position overlooking the harbour has made it an iconic symbol of the city, and it is cherished by locals as a reminder of their history and heritage.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 43697833}

It runs parallel to the River Inn and runs through the Inn Valley fresh air region (Luftsanierungsgebiet).ImportanceThe Kufstein–Innsbruck section, together with the Brenner Autobahn and the German A93 and A8, form the main transport axis from Munich over the Alps to Verona and Modena. In addition the A12 links Tyrol via the so-called German Corner (Deutsches Eck) to Salzburg and the West Autobahn (A1) to Vienna.The A12 was the first autobahn in Austria that was equipped with an intelligent transportation system. These overhead signs provide information to the motorist on every type of situation (road conditions, traffic, weather, etc.) as well as speed limits.During summer vacation period 2019, every weekend from mid-June to mid-September, on the section around Innsbruck as well as on A13 (Austria) Brenner Autobahn it is not allowed to leave the motorway in case of traffic jams. This measure is a controversial issue. The most important reason is to protect the local population suffering from the consequences of the denser traffic on rural roads leading parallel to the motorway. This kind of evasion traffic leads to another congestions, noise and pollution. On the other hand, local hotel and restaurant owners are worried about forfeits. Furthermore, whoever wants to avoid the traffic jam will find a pretext for his intention to leave the motorway in case of an inquiry by the Austrian police. However, there is no obligation to show a confirmation for a hotel reservation along the road.GeschichteDer Ostast der Inntal Autobahn von Kufstein bis zum Knoten Innsbruck-Amras wurde in Etappen zwischen 1968 und 1972 eröffnet, die Anschlussstellen in Innsbruck in den 1970er Jahren und der Westast in den 1980er Jahren. Der Roppener Tunnel wurde erst 1990 fertiggestellt.Im Juli 1990 musste die „Wildbichler Brücke“ für längere Zeit gesperrt werden, da ein Brückenpfeiler im Inn absackte. Während dieser Zeit musste der gesamte Autobahn- und Hauptstraßenverkehr durch die Kufsteiner Innenstadt umgeleitet werden, auch die Unterinntalbahn der ÖBB war zeitweise gesperrt.Im Jahr 2000 wurde als erste Kontrollstelle Österreichs die Kontrollstelle in Kundl in Fahrtrichtung Innsbruck in Betrieb genommen. Sie war als Provisorium geplant, wurde jedoch ein Jahr später ausgebaut.Am 1. Mai 2001 kam es auf der A12 bei Vomp zu einem schweren Busunglück. Ein Gelenkbus kam aufgrund von Spurrillen ins Schleudern, kippte um, durchbrach die Mittelleitplanke und blieb quer zur Fahrbahn liegen. Acht Insassen kamen ums Leben, 51 wurden zum Teil schwer verletzt. Bei den schwierigen Bergungsarbeiten waren mehr als 330 Rettungskräfte im Einsatz. Beide Fahrtrichtungen waren mehrere Stunden gesperrt.Am 25. April 2005 wurde die Kontrollstelle Radfeld eröffnet. Damit können beide Fahrtrichtungen der A12 kontrolliert werden. Der Polizei steht als Dienststelle die Kontrollstelle Radfeld mit ihren Räumlichkeiten zur Verfügung.Im August 2005 wurde aufgrund eines extremen Hochwassers ein mehr als 30 km langes Teilstück der A12 von der bayrisch-österreichischen Grenze bis Kramsach gesperrt, weil für die „Kufstein-Brücke“ bei Kufstein-Kiefersfelden ein Einsturz wegen Unterspülung befürchtet wurde. Nach einigen Tagen konnte diese Gefahr jedoch nicht bestätigt werden und die Sperre wurde wieder aufgehoben.Anfang Dezember 2006 wurde die nicht unumstrittene Anschlussstelle Innsbruck-Mitte eröffnet, sie ermöglicht den Dörfern des östlichen Mittelgebirges eine schnellere Anbindung an die Autobahn.Am 17. Dezember 2010 wurden der zweiröhrige Betrieb des Roppener Tunnels und die Nordröhre der Einhausung Amras freigegeben.Derzeitige Ausbauvorhaben betreffen den Zubringer Tschirganttunnel zur FernpassstraßeFernpassstrecke und einen teilweisen dreispurigen Ausbau je Fahrtrichtung des stark belasteten Ostastes im Unterinntal. Beide Maßnahmen sind jedoch umstritten.KontrollstellenAufgrund der positiven Auswirkungen auf die Verkehrssicherheit seit der Inbetriebnahme der ersten Kontrollstelle in Kundl hat sich der Tiroler Landtag 2003 zur Umsetzung des Tiroler Kontrollstellenkonzeptes entschlossen und 2004 mit der ASFINAG einen Vertrag zur Errichtung der KOST Radfeld abgeschlossen. Im August 2004 wurde mit dem Bau für das 4,6 Mio. teure Projekt begonnen und im Frühjahr 2005 vollendet.Die Ausleitung von der A12 auf die jeweilige Kontrollstelle wurde in die Verkehrsbeeinflussungsanlage integriert, eine automatische Stauerkennung ist ebenso möglich wie eine angepasste Geschwindigkeitsanzeige. Zu den Aufgaben der Kontrollstellen gehören hauptsächlich die Kontrolle von LKWs und Bussen bezüglich der Einhaltung der zulässigen Höchstgewichte, der sozialrechtlichen und straßenrechtlichen Vorschriften, des technischen Zustands der Fahrzeuge und der richtige Deklaration und Kennzeichnung von Gefahrguttransporten. Bei Kontrollen des Schwerverkehrs aber auch den Personenverkehrs finden zusätzlich Alkoholkontrollen und Kontrollen der Sicherheitseinrichtungen (Gurtenpflicht, Kindersicherung) statt.LiteraturBundesministerium für Bauten und Technik und Land Tirol (Hg.), Inntal-Autobahn, Innsbruck 1973.External linksInntal Autobahn auf motorways-exitlists.com (englisch)See alsoAutobahns of AustriaReferencesAutobahns in Austria Kufstein District Innsbruck-Land District Transport in Innsbruck Imst District Landeck District Transport in Tyrol (state)", "machine_text": " The Inn Valley Autobahn (Germany: Innbaltal Autobahn), abbreviated A12, is an autobahn in Austria.

The highway is an essential transportation corridor through the picturesque valley, serving both commercial and vacation traffic. Services along the route include gas stations, taxi companies, and roadside restaurants. The A12 is a 1.5 lane highway in Germany, and a dual 2-lane highway in Austria; it is an especially popular route between Vienna, Innsbruck, and Salzburg. Although there are no tolls on the autobahn, the speed limits range from a minimum of 70 km/h to a maximum of 130 km/h. Traffic along the route is monitored by Austrian police, and electronic signs inform motorists of traffic levels and conditions along the route. The A12 is just one of the several major vehicular connection links across the Inn Valley. There are also several significant portions of rail lines which connect the cities of Salzburg and Innsbruck; for example, the highly scenic Zillertalbahn, a narrow gauge railway which services the eastern portion of the valley. Overall, the A12 provides a convenient transport way for travelers travelling between Salzburg and Innsbruck, allowing them to take advantage of all the natural beauty along the Inn Valley route.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Bifid cipher\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "In classical cryptography, the bifid cipher is a cipher which combines the Polybius square with transposition, and uses fractionation to achieve diffusion. It was invented around 1901 by Felix Delastelle.OperationFirst, a mixed alphabet Polybius square is drawn up, where the I and the J share their position:1 2 3 4 51 B G W K Z2 Q P N D S3 I O A X E4 F C L U M5 T H Y V R The message is converted to its coordinates in the usual manner, but they are written vertically beneath:F L E E A T O N C E4 4 3 3 3 5 3 2 4 31 3 5 5 3 1 2 3 2 5 They are then read out in rows:4 4 3 3 3 5 3 2 4 3 1 3 5 5 3 1 2 3 2 5 Then divided up into pairs again, and the pairs turned back into letters using the square:44 33 35 32 43 13 55 31 23 25UAEOLWRINS In this way, each ciphertext character depends on two plaintext characters, so the bifid is a digraphic cipher, like the Playfair cipher. To decrypt, the procedure is simply reversed.Longer messages are first broken up into blocks of fixed length, called the period, and the above encryption procedure is applied to each block. One way to detect the period uses bigram statistics on ciphertext letters separated by half the period. For even periods, p, ciphertext letters at a distance of p/2 are influenced by two plaintext letters, but for odd periods, p, ciphertext letters at distances of p/2 (rounded either up or down) are influenced by three plaintext letters. Thus, odd periods are more secure than even against this form of cryptanalysis, because it would require more text to find a statistical anomaly in trigram plaintext statistics than bigram plaintext statistics.See alsoOther ciphers by Delastelle:four-square cipher (related to Playfair)trifid cipher (similar to bifid)ReferencesExternal linksOnline Bifid Encipherer/Decipherer with polybius square generatorClassical ciphers", "machine_text": " The Bifid cipher is an encryption technique used for data security. It was invented by French amateur cryptographer Félix Delastelle in 1901. Bifid is a symmetric cipher that combines two classic techniques: the Polybius square and fractionation. Its complexity makes it more secure than other encryption methods, as it is difficult to crack with both cryptanalysis and brute-force methods, even though there are known successful attacks. The cipher starts by arranging a Polybius square, a grid of size 5x5 with letters (in this case usually replaced by numbers). Since only 25 characters can be used to fill the grid, additional checksum letters can be added (i.e., X, Y or Z). After that, the plaintext message is written with the coordinates of each of the characters in the Polybius square. For example, the plaintext message 'HELLO' would be written 12 33 11 44 44. Then, in the same order the coordinates were written, the rows and columns of the Polybius square are divided into two halves. This is known as fractionation, as it divides the characters into fractions. Using the example from before, the message becomes 12, 33, 11, 44, 44 divided in the two halves 3134, 1443. Once the division is performed, the two parts are written in alternating positions to create a new string with the same length, known as a keystream. The keystream for our example would be 31443143. After that, the keystream is added to the coordinates of the original message, subtracting the values modulo 25. This produces the ciphertext. In this case, the ciphertext would be 93543017. Finally, to decrypt the message, the same process is repeated, but this time the keystream is subtracted from the ciphertext. The resulting message is written in the same way, using the coordinates of the original message to obtain the plaintext. For example, subtracting the keystream from the ciphertext of our example, results in 03104444. The coordinates of the Polybius square corresponding to this result are 11, 33, 04, 44, 44, which translate to 'HELLO', the plaintext message. The Bifid Cipher can be seen as a way to combine two different encryption techniques to enhance data security, making it one of the more secure encryption methods available.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 632918}

Actors David Jason and Nicholas Lyndhurst reprised their roles as Del Boy and Rodney in the sketch written by Jim Sullivan and Dan Sullivan; the script included previously unused material written by their father John Sullivan, who created and wrote every episode of the series. David Beckham guest starred,Beckham having got in touch with Jim Sullivan.According to Shazam Productions there was a lot of interest in the sketch. The return of Only Fools and Horses was eagerly awaited by fans of the show, which ran from 1981 until 2003.This special sketch was dedicated to the memory of John Sullivan and Roger Lloyd-Pack, who had both died prior to its broadcast.SynopsisAn unspecified amount of time after the series' last regular episode 'Sleepless in Peckham,' Del Boy is in Peckham market, trying to sell 'Golden Balls' underpants which are supposedly endorsed and signed by David Beckham (in return for Del Boy securing a bouncy castle for the birthday party of one of Beckham's son's, Brooklyn, who Del incorrectly calls Brookside), with Rodney serving as a less-than-enthusiastic model. After failing to sell anything, the Trotters retreat to a nearby cafe, where Rodney complains about Del's treatment of him. Del apologises, mentioning several incidents where he had mistreated Rodney. (These being incidents from previous regular Only Fools and Horses episodes.) Sharing the table with the two is David Beckham, who it turns out actually has endorsed the underpants. The three briefly chat, including Rodney and Beckham discussing their favourite artist (Rodney choosing Matisse, and Beckham choosing Tony Hart), before Beckham gives Rodney tips on how to model underwear effectively, advising him to 'glide' and 'oscillate.'Later on, Del is again trying to sell the underpants, with Rodney putting on a bizarre, vaguely feminine walk, and being even more angry at Del than he was before, telling him 'Derek, I'm going to kill you'. Beckham is discreetly watching this, when a young boy walks up to him, and asks him if he's David Beckham. He says that he is, and signs the boy's football, but says not to tell anyone he is there, as he does not want to draw anymore attention to himself. Beckham then attempts to lean back on a goods cart, but a trader moves it away while he isn't looking and he falls to the ground (referencing a famous moment in the episode 'Yuppy Love'), getting the attention of everyone in the market.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Jemaah Tarbiyah\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Jemaah Tarbiyah, also known as the Tarbiyah movement or the Dakwah movement, is an Islamic religious movement based in Indonesia. Jemaah Tarbiyah was an active movement during the 1980s to 1990s and consisted of university students, aimed at the religious education and da'wah (proselytizing). The movement is considered to be influenced by the teaching of Muslim Brotherhood. It is considered an important influence for Islamization of Indonesia. The movement became the bedrock of the Islamist party Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) which was founded in 2002.Etymology The term tarbiyah () means 'intensive Islamic education' or 'disciplining' in Arabic. Initially, the term was mainly used by outsiders to designate the particular phenomenon and activities conducted by certain groups. There has been no formal consensus on the naming by the activists of the movement. Tarbiyah is often used by Indonesian Islamic higher educational institutions as a name of faculties specialized in religious education. The term was also used by a socio-religious organization Union of Islamic Education (Persatuan Tarbiyah Islam, PERTI) established in 1928. The usage of tarbiyah in the context of Jemaah Tarbiyah has no direct relations with any of the latter.History There had been a history of da'wah based on university campuses, notably of elite secular universities such as Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB) since the 1970s. However, there was a demand for more comprehensive and systematic methods of da'wah, which was still very informal and strictly monitored by the Suharto regime. Some religious gatherings based in Salman Mosque of ITB is considered one of many origins of Jemaah Tarbiyah. These religious gatherings put particular emphasis on specific attitudes toward basic Islamic teachings and interpretations, including the principle of ukhuwah (brotherhood), dress code, and the prohibition on smoking.Among the activists of Jemaah Tarbiyah, four Muslim students returned from the Islamic University of Madinah, Hilmi Aminuddin, Salim Segaf Aljufri, Abdullah Said Baharmus, and Acep Abdul Syukur, are considered founding fathers (collectively called muassis). Facing demands of more systematic proselytization and religious education, these four students and their cohorts have articulated a comprehensive program and organized activities, improved with methodology from the Middle East which was often named as usrah system. Its religious gatherings were known as halaqah which involved mentoring and Qur'anic recitations. Since early to mid-1980s, the activity had quickly spread across elite secular universities, where religious education was required to be complemented.Jemaah Tarbiyah has often been pointed out of its Muslim Brotherhood influence. Usrah system was a training program of Muslim Brotherhood members, and the Tarbiyah movement had directly implemented the methodology. Activists of the Tarbiyah movement are also considered to be committed toward translation of books written by members of Muslim Brotherhood, including Hassan al-Banna and Sayyid Qutb. There is also an explanation that links Jemaah Tarbiyah to the Indonesian Islamic Dawaah Council (DDII), a conservative Islamic organization headed by Mohammad Natsir. DDII had contributed to the constructions of mosques in the universities and was central to the importation of religious teachings from the Middle East. Some of the prominent activists of Jemaah Tarbiyah had DDII backgrounds.Throughout the 1980s, Jemaah Tarbiyah had managed to grow its influence underground, mostly due to its focus on religious issues and avoided political activism. The movement had also established formal institutions with similar aims but without explicit reference toward its connections. Such institutions include foundations like Nurul Fikri, Al-Hikmah Boarding School, and PA-HAM. In the 1990s, the movement had established influence over many intra-university student organizations and discussion forums. The movement accommodated various Islamic religious strands from traditionalist to modernists, and was fluid regarding pragmatic concerns such as political system.After the fall of Suharto and the beginning of the democratic transition, activists of the movement founded an Islamist political party Justice Party (PK) in 1998, and its successor Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) in 2002. Majority of the members of PK and PKS, including the first president of PK Nurmahmudi Ismail, were activists of Jemaah Tarbiyah. The establishment of a political party was chosen over the establishment of a formal socio-religious organization. The decision was supported by the majority of the activists. Main activities related to da'wah conducted during the Jemaah Tarbiyah era were succeeded by the political parties. Today, activists of Jemaah Tarbiyah have been continuously influencing the creation of new trends in da'wah and Islamic socio-religious movements, including One Day One Juz (ODOJ).NotesFootnotesReferences Damanik, A.S.

It is based primarily in Jakarta, but operates around 28,000 mosques and prayer centers throughout Indonesia. The organization seeks to promote the practice of an Islamic lifestyle, through community and religious educational programs, advocacy work and legal consultation. Jemaah Tarbiyah was heavily inspired by the teachings of Muhammadiyah, an early Islamic movement that rose alongside Nationalism in Indonesia in the 19th century, which advocated for a spiritual lifestyle based on Islamic teachings. However, Tarbiyah seeks to separate itself from partisan politics, focusing on activities that Muslims can take to better their lifestyles and aid the development of their communities. The main activities of Jemaah Tarbiyah are cultural and educational. It actively campaigns for healthy lifestyles and offers guidance on healthcare and nutrition, focusing specifically on the benefits of Islamic dietary laws, such as a prohibition on pork consumption or alcohol consumption. Jemaah Tarbiyah also offers online classes and counseling conducted by certified counselors, tailored lectures with various themes ranging from dress code to parenting, and devotional activities such as Islamic monthly fasting and pilgrimage. Jemaah Tarbiyah also seeks to enhance positive religious experiences for refugees and provide assistance to those affected in numerous humanitarian crises. It collaborates with international organizations like International Organization for Migration (IOM) and Islamic Relief as well as local organizations in Banten, Central Java and South Sulawesi in providing food, nutrition and healthcare services. In addition, Jemaah Tarbiyah has undertaken several legal challenges against the state over various issues. These challenges have included filing a lawsuit against the Indonesian Ministry of Education over the spread of Islamic radicalism in public schools and appealing to the Constitutional Court over an unlawful registration system of religious practices. Overall, Jemaah Tarbiyah is an example of a contemporary Islamic organization based in Indonesia, dedicated to promoting an Islamic lifestyle and providing assistance to people in need. Through its various activities and legal challenges, the organization seeks to build and strengthen the relationship between Indonesia and the rest of the Islamic world, with the ultimate goal of ensuring peace and unity for the nation and its people.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 59002996}

He was considered to be one of Japan's foremost animators, and he was an important mentor to both Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata.Biography Ōtsuka was born in Shimane Prefecture. During a visit to Tsuwano at the age of 10, he saw a steam locomotive for the first time. He began to take an interest in locomotives and their operation and would frequently sketch them. In 1945, his family moved to Yamaguchi Prefecture where there was a military base. He began to draw the array of military vehicles located there while also drawing a variety of subjects in different styles. Otsuka also collected cuttings of cartoon strips into scrapbooks to learn more about drawing styles. Otsuka joined Yamaguchi's Bureau of Statistics but later wanted to become a political cartoonist in Tokyo. However at the time, permission was needed to move to Tokyo so he applied to the Health and Welfare Ministry. After passing the exam, he was assigned to the drug enforcement division as an assistant who maintained the firearms of the agents. Around this time he suffered from tuberculosis.Career In 1956, Otsuka saw an advertisement in the Yomiuri Shinbun where Toei was soliciting job applications for animators. After passing the test, Otsuka worked with Yasuji Mori and Akira Daikubara on The Tale of the White Serpent and learnt their approaches. Wanting to learn more animation theory, he began to seek out textbooks and was shown a textbook on US animation written by Preston Blair. After working on Magic Boy in 1959, his animation of a skeleton was unintentionally considered comical due to its realism. This led to comical bad guy characters becoming Otsuka's specialty. He came to believe that genuine realism doesn't suit animation and 'constructed realism' is more suitable. Hayao Miyazaki compared Otsuka to Kenichi Enomoto in the use of this approach. After completion of his next film, The Wonderful World of Puss 'n Boots, Otsuka left Toei to join A Production.Otsuka has written several books about the anime industry. Hisis considered 'a prime resource for the history of 1960s and 1970s anime'.In July 2002, an exhibition of his work and personal pieces was held in Ginza.From 2003 until his death, Otsuka was an advisor to Telecom Animation Film.WorksReferencesExternal links'Conversation between Otsuka Yasuo and Sadamoto Yoshiyuki'1931 births 2021 deaths Anime character designers Japanese animators Lupin the Third People from Shimane Prefecture Studio Ghibli people Toei Animation", "machine_text": ".

Zambrano, a 35-year-old man originally from Michoacán, Mexico, was shot and killed by three police officers after allegedly throwing rocks at cars and police officers. His hands were in the air when the police fired the shots. Police officers said one of the rocks was as large as a softball. A toxicology report conducted by police found Zambrano's blood tested positive for methamphetamine.Zambrano-Montes' family initially filed a 4.8 million claim against the city of Pasco for the shooting, which they called an 'execution', saying he 'did not represent a threat of grievous bodily harm to anyone' at the time of his death. Two of the officers involved in the shooting were white, and one was Hispanic. The killing led to criticism by the Mexican government. with the country's President, Enrique Peña Nieto, condemning the officers' 'disproportionate use of lethal force.'Background Zambrano-Montes was raised in Michoacán, Mexico, the third of sixteen children born to Jesús Montes and Agapita Montes-Rivera. In 2004, he immigrated to the United States to work in the orchards. He was married with two daughters. His wife had previously obtained a protection order against him alleging abuse. Zambrano-Montes was in the country illegally and did not speak English. He was arrested for assaulting a police officer in January 2014. The police stated that he had tried to grab an officer's pistol in the officer's holster as well as throwing objects at the officers and trying to strike them with a mailbox. He pleaded guilty in June 2014. Prior to the incident, he had spent some time in a homeless shelter and was 'struggling emotionally' after being unable to work after an injury. According to police reports, the officers first tried to subdue him with voice commands and then with a Taser.Shooting Three officers—Ryan Flanagan, Adam Wright and Adrian Alaniz—fired on Zambrano-Montes. Flanagan and Wright are white, and Alaniz is Hispanic. None of them were wearing body cameras. The shooting was caught on video by a civilian who recorded the incident from about 50 feet away showing Zambrano-Montes was running away from police, either with a rock in his hand or unarmed, and turned to face the officers before he was shot by them. Several weeks prior to the shooting, one of the officers, Adam Wright, had dragged Zambrano-Montes away from his burning rental home.Aftermath The death of Zambrano-Montes led to criticism by the Mexican government with Mexico's Congress calling the shooting an 'act that outrages all Mexicans' and the country's President, Enrique Peña Nieto, condemning the officers' 'disproportionate use of lethal force.' There were also mass protests in Pasco, with many protesters attending from outside the local community. The Tri-City Herald reported that 'turmoil continued in Pasco nearly two weeks after the controversial shooting of Antonio Zambrano-Montes,' as protests are not typically of this size in this town. A small ongoing presence of activists was present at the Pasco City Hall.The three officers involved in the shooting were placed on paid administrative leave. As of February 16, 'a multiagency investigation was underway'. A local group, Consejo Latino, called for an additional investigation by the United States Department of Justice.There are 68 officers on the police force in Pasco, of whom 14 (21", "machine_text": " Antonio Zambrano-Montes was a 35-year-old Mexican-American man who was shot and killed by three officers of the Pasco Police Department in Pasco, Washington, United States on February 10, 2015. On the day of his death, Zambrano-Montes was walking in the street and throwing 'rocks the size of softballs' at various cars and passersby. Three Pasco police officers, Ryan Flanagan, Adam Wright, and Adrian Alaniz, responded to a call about a man throwing rocks at cars. Zambrano-Montes had a criminal record, which included a prior conviction for assault. When the officers attempted to arrest Zambrano-Montes, he ran down the street and was pursued by one of the officers, who attempted to subdue him with a taser. When the taser was unsuccessful, the other two officers joined in the pursuit. According to an investigation by the Tri-City Special Investigative Unit, Zambrano-Montes stopped briefly at a stop sign and then turned to face the officers when they caught up with him. At this time, officers Flanagan and Wright fired a total of 17 rounds at Zambrano-Montes, while Officer Alaniz fired one shot. Zambrano-Montes was killed by the shots. His death sparked protests and accusations of police brutality and racism, as Zambrano-Montes was a Hispanic man. After the incident, an internal review by the Pasco Police Department determined that the three officers had followed proper protocol. Additionally, a Franklin County inquest jury found the three officers not guilty in a second round of hearings in April 2016. However, a lawsuit is currently being brought against the City of Pasco by the Zambrano-Montes family. The death of Zambrano-Montes has prompted calls for changes to police training and protocols, particularly regarding the use of deadly force and interactions with people suffering from mental health issues. This case has been cited in the formation of a new unit in the Washington State Patrol which specifically focuses on police shootings and their investigation. The memory of Antonio Zambrano-Montes lives on in Pasco, Washington, where a memorial was dedicated in his honor on the fourth anniversary of his death. The memorial serves as a reminder of the death of a father, son, and friend who did not have to be taken from his family and community.

This process is called noncanonical splicing, as opposed to U2-dependent canonical splicing. U12-type introns represent less than 1", "machine_text": " The Minor Spliceosome is a ribonucleoprotein complex composed of four core proteins and three small nuclear RNA (snRNA) molecules. It is involved in the removal of introns from pre-mRNA transcripts during the process of alternative splicing in eukaryotes. The four core proteins are: U11, U12, U4atac, and U5-snRNPs (small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles). It differs from the major spliceosome in both composition and structure: the minor spliceosome lacks U2 snRNP and does not have an alternate exon junction complex present in major spliceosome. U5 snRNP is the major difference with the U5 snRNA molecule being retained throughout the entire splicing process in the minor spliceosome. The U11 and U12 proteins stabilise the structure of the complex while the U4atac protein binds directly to the intron in order to facilitate the splicing process. In a normal pre-mRNA transcript, there are two regions (splice sites) where fractional introns can be removed and the adjacent exons can be joined together to complete the mature mRNA molecule. The minor spliceosome binds to a particular site between the two regions and after binding, it facilitates the cutting of the intron and ligation of the two exons that form the mature mRNA molecule. During this process, the U5 snRNP acts as a bridge linking the cleaved intron and the two exons and the U4atac protein is recruited for recognition of proper splice sites. Alternative splicing is a process that allows for the production of a diverse range of protein from a single gene, with differential splicing being the main process of achieving this variety. It is important for eukaryotes in that it allows for the customisation of protein functionality for certain cellular processes. The minor spliceosome also plays an important role in gene expression. It is known to be involved in the post-transcriptional modification of some mRNAs leading to the production of a protein isoform with a limited functional activity. This process is known as premature mRNA decay and is linked to the regulation of the expression of certain genes. In comparison to the major spliceosome, the minor spliceosome is lDedicated to splicing a small set of RNAs, therefore, its activity and function is highly restricted which allows it to be more effective in splicing certain pre-mRNA transcripts. The Minor spliceosome is important in the alternative splicing of pre-mRNA transcripts, providing for the customisation of protein functionality and gene expression. As such, it is an important part of gene expression and the production of a variety of proteins from a single gene.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 7900132}

Woods enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force in September 1916 and, after training in Australia and the United Kingdom, joined his unit, the 48th Battalion, in France in September 1917. Along with the rest of his battalion, he participated in the First Battle of Passchendaele the following month. In early 1918, Woods was hospitalised for several months before rejoining his unit in May. He again reported sick in July, and did not return to the 48th Battalion until mid-August.On 18 September 1918, the 48th Battalion was involved in the attack on the Hindenburg Outpost Line during the Hundred Days Offensive. After the first phase of the attack, some elements of Woods' unit were tasked to support another battalion as it conducted a further assault. When it was suspected that flanking British troops had not gone forward to their objective as reported, a four-man patrol including Woods attempted to make contact with them. Instead of finding British troops, they encountered a strong German post and, after calling for reinforcements, attacked it, driving more than thirty Germans from the position. Woods' actions during this assault and subsequent defence of the captured post resulted in him being awarded the Victoria Cross. Woods survived the war, returned to Australia and operated a vineyard and orchard in Western Australia. He retired early due to ill health and died in 1963. His medals are displayed in the Hall of Valour at the Australian War Memorial.Early life James Park 'Jimmy' Woods was born at Two Wells, South Australia, on 4 January 1886, the son of a blacksmith, James Woods, and his wife EsterJohnson. After his mother's death when he was seven, Woods was raised by a stepsister and, after completing his schooling, worked in a vineyard alongside his brothers. Not long after World War I broke out in 1914, he attempted to enlist in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF), but was rejected due to his height of . He and his brother Will then moved to Western Australia and for the next two years worked in cartage and fencing in the Kantanning district before James became a viticulturist at Caversham in the Swan Valley wine region near Perth. He was also an enthusiastic cricketer in his younger years. After further unsuccessful attempts to join the AIF, he was eventually successful on 29 September 1916, after height requirements had been lowered.World War I1916–1917 Following his enlistment as a private, Woods was allotted as a reinforcement to the 48th Battalion, a mixed South Australian-Western Australian unit, part of the 12th Brigade, 4th Division. It was already serving on the Western Front in France and Belgium. After two months training at Blackboy Hill, Woods embarked with the rest of his reinforcement draft onat Fremantle on 23 December 1916. He disembarked at Devonport in the UK on 16 February 1917, and joined the 12th Training Battalion at Codford on Salisbury Plain. During this training period, he was hospitalised with mumps and then with bronchitis and pneumonia. Recovered, he completed his training, embarked at Southampton for France, and joined the 48th Battalion on 12 September.At the time Woods joined the battalion, it was undergoing training and absorbing reinforcements in a rest area at Zuytpeene. On 21 September, the battalion was collected by buses and transported over several days via Steenvoorde to the vicinity of Ypres in Belgium. There the 12th Brigade relieved other units of the 4th Division that had participated in the Battle of Polygon Wood and took up support positions. During this period its main tasks were battlefield salvage and digging graves for recently killed Germans and Australians. Despite these non-combat tasks, the battalion suffered several casualties from German artillery fire. The 48th Battalion was relieved from these positions on 1 October, and occupied trenches at Westhoek Ridge overnight before returning to Steenvoorde.After a week at Steenvoorde, Woods' battalion marched to Abeele on 10 October, then entrained for Ypres. That evening it marched to trenches on Westhoek Ridge, where it received orders for a major attack by the division: the First Battle of Passchendaele, which was fought on 12 October. Despite initial success and the capture of more than 200 Germans, the main attack failed, leaving the left flank of the battalion exposed. The first German counterattack was beaten off, but with its left flank unprotected, the 48th Battalion was pushed back to its start line by a second counterattack. During the fighting, the unit suffered 370 casualties from its original complement of 621. Woods and the rest of the battalion were withdrawn from the line and they were re-united with the nucleus troops, the one-third of each unit that was retained out of the line when a battalion went into action. Thus reinforced, the battalion then went briefly into a support position on Anzac Ridge on 19 October, before being relieved and marching away from Passchendaele for a long period of rest and recuperation. This time was spent first at Cuhem, then Friancourt before the battalion spent a few weeks at a camp near Péronne, where Woods and the rest of the unit celebrated Christmas Day.1918 On 8 January 1918, the 48th Battalion marched to Péronne and, travelling by train and on foot, arrived in Belgium where they entered the front line trenches near Hollebeke on 11 January. The battalion remained in the quiet trenches in cold winter conditions for ten days before being relieved, being mainly engaged on improving the dilapidated defences. On the day after the battalion was relieved and went into the rear area, Woods reported sick. He was diagnosed with either bronchitis or pericarditis, and was evacuated to a hospital in Birmingham, UK. He did not return to his battalion until 30 May, when the battalion was in a rest area at Rivery. On 2 June the unit moved forward again, taking up positions as part of the divisional reserve. Two weeks later, the 48th Battalion moved into the front line near Sailly-le-Sec, from which it was relieved on 4 July. It then went back into a rest area near Allonville with the remainder of the 4th Division. This rest period continued to the end of the month, but on 23 July, Woods reported sick with dysentery. He was evacuated and admitted to a casualty clearing station to recover, and did not return to his unit until 16 August. At this time, the battalion was in the front line near Lihons, where it had a quiet time until relieved on 24 August. The unit was then withdrawn to a rest area near Saint-Vaast-en-Chaussée where it remained for nearly two weeks.By September 1918, the Allies were in the midst of the Hundred Days Offensive, a series of unanswered attacks that had commenced with the Battle of Amiens on 8 August. As part of the attack on the Hindenburg Outpost Line on 18 September, the 48th Battalion led the assault in the first phase, capturing 480 Germans, and they were followed by the 45th and 46th Battalions which were responsible for the second and third phases respectively. The Australian attack was near Le Verguier, north-west of St. Quentin. On the right flank of the 12th Brigade, the British 1st Division delayed its assault on the third objective line. The commander of the 12th Brigade, Brigadier General Raymond Leane, therefore ordered two companies of the 48th Battalion to protect the flank of the 46th Battalion as it conducted the third phase of the attack. After the 46th Battalion's successful assault, the two companies of the 48th Battalion were tasked to assist the 46th Battalion in consolidating their position. The British 1st Division on the right flank repeatedly reported that they had also captured the third objective, and Leane sent patrols to confirm.Woods was a member of a four-man patrol sent on Leane's orders to make contact with the British. Instead of finding British troops, they located a strongly defended German position with excellent fields of fire. While an attack in force on the position was being organised, Woods led the patrol against the German defenders. Woods killed one German, and at least thirty others fled, leaving behind four heavy and two light machine guns. One of the patrol was wounded in the assault, but they managed to hold off several determined counterattacks until reinforcements arrived. Woods climbed onto the parapet, lay down, and threw hand grenades passed to him, causing severe casualties to the Germans. Reinforcements arrived when he was down to his last few rifle cartridges, and the post was secured by dawn. During the overall brigade attack, the 48th Battalion suffered just 65 casualties. For his work, Woods was recommended for the Victoria Cross (VC).The 4th Division was then relieved and went to the rear to rest, and the brigade did not return to combat before the Armistice of 11 November 1918. Woods' VC citation was published on Christmas Eve 1918, and read:Woods' VC was the only one awarded to a member of the 48th Battalion. He received the decoration from King George V at Buckingham Palace on 31 May 1919. Woods embarked aboard the troop shipon 21 June, arrived back in Fremantle in early August, and was discharged from the AIF the following month.Later lifeOn his return to civilian life, Woods bought and operated a vineyard and orchard in the Swan Valley. He married Olive Adeline Wilson at the Caversham Methodist Church on 30 April 1921. The couple had seven children: four sons and three daughters. James suffered from poor health as a result of his gassing and chest infections during his service, and in 1937 retired on a full pension, expected to only live a few more years. The family moved to Claremont. His sons Gordon and Norman served in the Royal Australian Air Force during World War II; Gordon, the eldest, was killed in a flying training accident near Newcastle, New South Wales, in October 1943. In retirement, Woods was involved with the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, serving as president of the Caversham sub-branch, and was a keen fisherman. In 1956, he went to the UK to attend the VC centenary.Woods died on 18 January 1963 in the Repatriation General Hospital, Hollywood, in Nedlands, aged 77, and was buried in Karrakatta Cemetery. He was survived by his wife and six children. A ward at the Repatriation General Hospital, now known as the Hollywood Private Hospital, is named in his honour.As well as the Victoria Cross, British War Medal and Victory Medal for his service in World War I, Woods was later awarded the King George VI Coronation Medal and Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal. His medal set, including his Victoria Cross, was presented to the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, and is displayed in the Hall of Valour. The Victoria Cross was the highest award possible at the time, and is considered the equivalent of the Victoria Cross for Australia, which was created in 1991.NotesFootnotesReferencesBooksNews and gazettesWebsites1886 births 1963 deaths Australian World War I recipients of the Victoria Cross Australian Army soldiers People from Two Wells, South Australia Burials at Karrakatta Cemetery", "machine_text": " James Park Woods (October 19th, 1971 - January 8th, 2019) was a well-known American novelist and poet who was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Music of Grim Fandango\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The music for the video game Grim Fandango was composed and produced by Peter McConnell and published by LucasArts in 1998. The soundtrack is a mix of South American folk music, jazz, swing and big band sounds, for the game story filled with adventure and intrigue set in a unique combination of film noir and Mexican folklore's Day of the Dead. The soundtrack garnered critical acclaim and remained subject of positive reviews and inclusion in critics' rankings for the two decades after its first release. The soundtrack was praised both as a stand-alone musical experience, as well as for its outstanding contribution to the overall game experience; capturing the spirit of the game,'gluing' the story together, and becoming 'integral' to the success of the game.A Compact disc (CD) soundtrack was released simultaneously with the game in 1998. The soundtrack was remastered and orchestrated, and re-released in 2015. In 2019, celebrating its 20th anniversary, it was also released in vinyl format.The score was awarded GameSpot 1998 'Best PC Music Award'. It was also nominated for the Academy of Interactive ArtsSciences' 'Outstanding Achievement in Sound and Music'. Years after its original release, the soundtrack has also been included in lists of all-time best video game soundtracks.Background and contextThe gameGrim Fandango is a graphic adventure video game directed by Tim Schafer and released by LucasArts in 1998. Set in the Mexican folklore's Land of the Dead and with a strong film noir twist, the story follows Department of Death's travel agent Manny Calavera who acts as a guide for recently departed souls as they travel through the Land of the Dead on their way to their final destinations. This land, meant to be only a place of passage to the final heavenly destination, has been settled by undeserving souls turning it into a land full of film noir-inspired crime and corruption, and making the travel of many departed souls more difficult and treacherous. The player follows Manny on a mission to save Mercedes 'Meche' Colomar, a good soul thrust into and trapped in this corrupted world.The game is one of the most acclaimed adventure games of all time, considered the last great adventure game to be released during the golden age of the adventure game genre. While composer Peter McConnell himself credits the outstanding directorial work of Tim Schafer, critics emphasized that one of the key components in the excellence of the game was McConnell's outstanding soundtrack.Team and collaborations Tim Schafer, Peter McConnell and other members of the development team had had long and overlapping careers from previous projects at LucasArts. For McConnell, who had joined LucasArts at the urging of Michael Land, another acclaimed composer of LucasArts, that included working on the music of other notable computer games, including Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge (1991), Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis (1992), SamMax Hit the Road (1993), Day of the Tentacle (1993), Full Throttle (1995).In composing for Grim Fandango, McConnell benefitted from having been a big jazz and film noir fan since his college time. He had his first experience in composing jazz in his work for Monkey Island; a team of composers (Michael Land, Clint Bajakian, and McConnell) split their work by the several islands in which the story of the game was set, and within McConnell's island (named Booty), he experimented with clarinet sounds.McConnell and Schafer's professional collaboration started with Day of the Tentacle, then continued with Full Throttle (possibly in part due to McConnell having a rock band at the time, which suited the genre of the game). However, it was with Grim Fandango that the relationship between the two became very close and set the stage for numerous subsequent collaborations, with McConnell becoming Schafer's 'go-to man'. After both of them departed LucasArts, they collaborated on titles including Psychonauts (2005), Brütal Legend (2009), and Broken Age (2015).Original developmentInspiration and influencesVery early in the process, project leader and writer Tim Schafer handed to McConnell black and white concept art of the characters sketched by Peter Chan, his collection of Humphrey Bogart films, and some vinyl records of a type Mexican folk music called Son, which McConnell described as 'very raw, using crude folk instruments' that included hand percussion, violins, and charangos.Having Schafer established the mood and tone of the project, McConnell said that aside from the listening material, Schafer did not give him much direction; 'In my experience, Tim leads more by inspiring than by directing'.When years later McConnell was asked how he reacted when he first played the game, he said that 'some games just really strike you when you first see the main character in the game environment. You think, 'Wow, this is something really different.' I remember feeling that when I first saw Manny walking around in Rubacava: 'A walking skeleton? Cool! And in this dark wet street like something from a different time, yet colorful and beautiful.''McConnell also noted how the game's mélange of themes was musically very 'potent' as it brought together diverse music styles, including folk, noir jazz, and classic underscore. To him, the whole game felt very inspirational, as dialogue, story, and the puzzles all worked together as an 'opera'; 'one big cohesive flow of music and voice' that made it special to score.Of the films provided by Schafer, McConnell focussed his attention in The Maltese Falcon, The Big Sleep, Treasure of the Sierra Madre, and Casablanca; The first one scored by Adolph Deutsch and the other three by Max Steiner. He watched them 'about a hundred times', and for the latter two being able to get copies of their scores from the Warner Brothers archives. He also acknowledged the influence of the films Glengarry Glen Ross and The City of Lost Children, the latter a French sci-fi/fantasy movie that informed the oceanic part of the game.One South American record that was influential was a Peruvian-style record by Gustavo Santaolalla titled Ronrocco released at the time, that made heavy use of charangos. It also coincided with Tim Schafer's brother having brought one such instrument from a trip to Mexico. All this led to McConnell eventually incorporating the charango as one of the unique sounds of the score, along with the Andean flutes quena and tarka. Despite the strong Latin American influences and themes, McConnell decided to not attempt to compose a particularly ethnic score, but to be 'organic' and to 'evoke a texture that was real'.McConnell explained how, since his college days, Duke Ellington had been a 'huge influence' for him and kept a headshot in his office studio at LucasArts. For this project, McConnell listened to Ellington's opus copiously. Finally, for ocean-related music, McConnell read scores of several Debussy works.Time and place had an important influence as well; McConnell was drawn to and inspired by the vibrant and diverse culture (musical and otherwise) of the San Francisco Mission District, which he called the 'crown jewel' of the city that included rock clubs, jazz clubs, taquerias with mariachis bands, and Mexican folklore.Composition processWhen later interviewed, McConnell noted his satisfaction of being given ample lead time to compose and produce the score; he first began to work on the project in early 1997, about a year and a half before the game's release. He developed three types of musical pieces: event-triggered episodes, ambient pieces, and underscoring for cutscenes. Tim Schafer's guidance and the cultures that shaped the game were the basis for the composition.In order to create a soundtrack that would follow the story of the game and mesh with the different settings within it, McConnell and his team created a digital interface system of little buttons that represented places in the game as a way to visually represent the score. They then recorded Schafer talking about the game and turned it into little snippets assigned to those plot points. Each point could then be clicked and hear Schafer's explanations of it. This was done using LucasArts iMUSE proprietary adaptive music system that McConnell himself had co-created with Michael Land a few years earlier.McConnell would then come up with a theme by humming a tune, record it in a cassette, play it back to Schafer, and eventually replace the plot points narration with those tunes.Then they developed a MIDI score to serve as a 'mock-up', leading to the recording of the final score that would include live musicians for some parts.Rather than fully develop each piece one at a time, his approach was to create a short sketch for each situation in the game of about fifteen seconds long and then move on as soon as he felt he had hit the target and gotten the gist of the mood. This allowed him to be more productive, as it was easier and less stressful to later on in the process develop full pieces based on already existing sketches, instead of rushing to develop completely novel compositions from scratch as the completion deadline neared. At his peak rate, he noted that there were weeks during which he composed as much as two minutes of finished music a day, which he considered a 'heavy regimen'.McConnell used the limited MIDI composition palette of the time, a couple of EMU E4 samplers (with 128 MB of RAM each), a Roland GMIDI Sound Canvas, and one or two other sound modules.Themes and recordingMcConnell went on to compose and produce Grim Fandangos original soundtrack, which combined an orchestral score, South American (Peruvian and Mexican) folk music, swing jazz from the noir era, jazz from other periods, bebop, and big band music. It also included some elements from traditional Russian, Celtic, Mexican, Spanish, and Indian strings cultures. In the original production, the orchestral elements of the score were digitally synthesized due to the common budgetary and technological limitations on gaming audio of the time. On the other hand, the jazz parts were recorded live, something uncommon at the time.McConnell understood that the game's atmosphere brought together a noir story that was familiar to the Anglo-American audience, with a Latin culture that may have been less familiar. He developed the jazz score to be most recognizable, taking the culturally specific part (the Latin jazz and the Latin folk music) and weaving it into the score ('taking it for granted rather than pointing it up') with the goal of naturally leading the audience from their comfort zone and then make an 'unfamiliar world more familiar.'An example of the rich atmospheric goals of the music is recounted by the French online publication Gameblog, that described the 'Mr. Frustration' track as 'sometimes bebop, sometimes melancholic, sweet or sensual' and observing that 'whether led by a saxophone, a trumpet or a guitar, jazz is the predominant style of the Grim Fandango soundtrack, all reminiscent of the snug atmosphere of casinos and bars between the two world wars'. It also described 'Lost Souls' Alliance', with its rhythmic arrangement and the use of an Andean flute, as evoking a feel of Hispanic music, with the tremolo baritone guitar reminiscent of the Western: 'a little 'rockabilly ballad' that makes us travel instantly to this corner of the planet and to that period, at the beginning of the twentieth century.'Especially given the disparate themes of Grim Fandango, McConnell kept the score cohesive by building it on a 'backbone' of classic Max Steiner-style orchestral underscoring. The orchestral part was digitally created, as the team did not consider doing live orchestra because at the time 'games didn’t occupy a place in the culture that could obtain that level of production.'To make the digital pieces sound more 'organic' and 'not quantized' and orchestra-like, McConnell tried to be 'very free with the tempo' so even though he was using a sequencer, it would sound like the conductor was watching the sequences of the game during the performance, following the old-school movie scoring methods.ReleaseThe full length of the score within the game was about three hours long, with an approximate 110 pieces. A 43-minute version with 32 tracks was concurrently released in 1998 as a CD album, sold at the LucasArts online company store.Critical receptionThe soundtrack was very well received at its original release, and it continued to receive praise years after, often considered one of the best game soundtracks of all time.At its original release, IGN called it a 'beautiful soundtrack that you'll find yourself listening to even after you're done with the game'. SEMO said 'the compositions and performances are so good that listening to this album on a stand-alone basis can make people feel like they're in a bar back then'. RPGFan said, 'the pieces are beautifully composed, wonderfully played (...). has a stellar soundtrack with music that easily stands alone outside the context of the game. This CD was an absolute pleasure to listen to and comes highly recommended.' Game Revolution in its game review praised it as one of the 'most memorable soundtracks ever to grace the inside of a cranial cavity where an eardrum used to be.' 20 years later ABC noted retrospectively that since the original release of the soundtrack it had been consistently praised; despite the technical limitations imposed on its original production 'it was still considered [at the time of its release] a stellar album to listen to, even without the context of the game, which speaks to the composer’s tremendous skill and musicality.'Years after the release, the soundtrack continued to receive critical acclaim. Kotaku noted in 2011 that 'it remains as killer today as it was when the game launched in 1998.' PC Gamer in its 2014 list of Top 100 Games, acclaimed Grim Fandango for including 'one of the best soundtracks in PC gaming history'. In 2017 Fact magazine also listed it as one of the '100 best video game soundtracks of all time'. Kotaku noted that even among other lauded games that were successful in incorporating jazz in their scores to great advantage (EarthBound, The Operative: No One Lives Forever, and L.A. Noire), Grim Fandangos stood apart. Further comparing it with L.A. Noire, Kotaku added that it 'doesn't come close to the variety and vivaciousness of McConnell's Grim Fandango score. From the dark, plunger-muted swing of 'Swanky Maximo' to the mellow, guitar-accompanied lobby-trombone of the appropriately named 'Frustration Man', it's simply good, video game-related or no.' It further lauded 'the epic saxophone of 'She Sailed Away', the chord-less free jazz of 'Blue Casket Bop', or the menacing bari sax/bass clarinet duet of 'Rubacava'' as highlights of an overall outstanding score.Alternative Magazine Online in 2015 noted that upon its original release it 'instantly became one of the greatest video game soundtracks of all time' and that the remastered version went even further.When the game and its soundtrack were remastered and re-released, they also garnered praise. Radio host Emily Reese called the score 'amazing', further adding how she really enjoyed how McConnell wrote the various sections of the orchestra: 'It seems [McConnell was] able to capitalize on really specific characteristics of the instruments; like you'll have the brass play in a militaristic style, or you'll have the bassoons or baby base clarinets being very mischievous, strings will do something where they are trembling(...).' Fact noted of the game that the game returned twenty years later in a new edition 'to the masterpiece-accolades (and sales) it deserved all along. Its remastering kept the soul of the game intact while polishing what needed to be polished: the graphics, animation, controls, and most importantly, the music.'Several critics also noted how the music was a key contribution to enhancing the overall experience of the game. For example, at the time of the original release Computer Gaming Worlds review remarked that 'a musical score (...) accompanies the art to complete the experience.' 20 years later, The Ringer noted that the best example in the game of the blending of cultures was its soundtrack, by combining elements of an orchestral score, with more traditional South American strings, and the jazz and swing music of the film noir era, becoming 'commonly celebrated as one of the best video game soundtracks of all time. Great adventure games such as Grim Fandango feature worlds so cohesive and rich with detail that they’re transportive for the player and McConnell’s soundtrack is the glue that binds the game's elements.' Kotaku noted upon revisiting the game in 2011 how 'I was struck by just how much McConnell's soundtrack (...) elevates the basic game.' in 2015 Fact magazine noted that 'few soundtracks have ever felt more integral to the success of a video game' and that 'the game’s blend of styles would never have held together so well if it weren’t for McConnell’s masterful ability to fuse Mexican folk music with Duke Ellington-era big band jazz and noir scores in the spirit of Adolph Deutsch.'Awards and rankingsIn 1999's Academy of Interactive ArtsSciences Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the soundtrack was nominated in the category of 'Outstanding Achievement in Sound and Music'. It was also lauded by GameSpot, which awarded it the 'Best PC Music awards', and included it in the 'Ten Best PC Game Soundtracks' list in 1999.At the time of the original release of Grim Fandango and its soundtrack, few video game music awards existed. Other video game music awards, such as from BAFTA or the Game Audio Network Guild, began to be awarded in the 2000s, and therefore Grim Fandangos soundtrack at the time of its release could not opt to compete for them. However, since then it has been included in several rankings of best video game music.Remastered soundtrackBackground and contextMcConnell had made the most of the resources he had for the score's original production, which meant devoting more of them where they could make the greatest impact while cutting corners in other areas. Even though, for example, he wished he had been able to find a better-sounding sampled piano, he did not regret not recording an acoustic piano as it would have meant compromising the quality of more important parts given the time and budget constraints. However, he had long wished to revisit the score if the opportunity arose, to fix and enhance the various aspects that had not been viable during the original production. He noted that 'Grim’s music was a little bit ahead of [its] time', and it suffered because of that. He also lamented that just two years after the release of Grim Fandango, orchestral recording in gaming took off.The Grim Fandango game had been originally developed and published by LucasArts, which in 2012 was acquired by Disney. In 2013, Disney made the strategic decision to turn LucasArts into a publisher-only of video games, and licensing out its intellectual property. Tim Schafer, who had also long been eager to revisit and re-release the game and make it available to new platforms and to new generations, seized the opportunity and was able to acquire the rights to the game, in partnership with Sony.So when in 2013 Schafer offered McConnell the unique opportunity to remaster the soundtrack, McConnell was ready to jump in. He believed that while the original jazz music came out well, the orchestral part, done with 1997-era digital samples and a limited budget, did not fully match his vision. He believed that remaking the latter would make the greatest difference: 'If you want to do something really great with this score, biggest bang for the buck is going to be to take those orchestral movements and record them live.'With the support of staff (who McConnell called 'friends of Grim' by either having worked on the original project or had grown up with it as a favorite game) at Disney Interactive, LucasArts, and Sony Computer Entertainment, Schafer's Double Fine studio worked to remaster the game and re-released it in 2015.Data recoveryThe remastering of the soundtrack started with the retrieval of the original 16-year-old data, in a process dubbed by Polygon as 'digital archeology'. The music tracks were on archaic DLT backup tapes stored in the LucasArts/Disney archives. Rob Cowles, a marketer at LucasArts was credited for saving the assets while LucasArts was being acquired by Disney in 2012. Subsequently, Derek Williams was credited for finding them.Once the original tapes were found, the next challenge was to retrieve the data from within them. McConnell remarked how their retrieval was a technical feat requiring specialized hardware and expertise Jory Prum (who then did the sound mixing for the orchestral pieces) spent two months recovering the data, with the use of DLT drive, an old Mac with a SCSI drive, and an old piece of software called Retrospect Remote. The fact that McConnell was able to open a Pro Tools session from 1997 on a new version of Pro Tools also proved key in being able to use the files. Except for the anecdotal disappearance of two cymbal hits, this process succeeded in recovering all the data of the three-hour score. McConnell called this recovery process 'a chain of miracles' since 'if any of the links had not held up, we would have had very little to work with at all.' McConnell further gratefully credited the retrieval success to numerous people who were devoted fans of the game, calling it a 'labor of love'.Improvements and re-recordingJust like with the original game development, project lead Tim Schafer had very little input into the soundtrack's re-mastering, except that 'he was very supportive of the effort to make the music the highest quality possible.'Given the unique opportunity to re-visit a project first developed 17 years earlier in his career, McConnell was asked how different would the soundtrack be if he had developed it from scratch at the time of remastering. McConnell noted that if he were to start from scratch he would have taken the exact same approach, with the exception of the 'crazy tempo' changes that he had never thought a real orchestra would have to perform; some parts were originally played live into a sequencer without regard for bar lines and retrospectively he would have taken a different approach. He also noted that there had been a small number of things that had long 'bugged' him from the original release ('the occasional klunker, or ham-fisted move') that he finally got the chance to fix them. However, overall, 'the pleasant surprise in the process was how well much of the original material held up'.To stay within the budget, McConnell felt he had to choose carefully which pieces would get the most attention and how. After the original Pro Tools project files were recovered, he found that some of the digital samples he had used originally did not sound good, and the team opted to re-mix, re-sample, add additional tracks, and re-orchestrate different parts of the score.These tasks were assigned to three teams: an audio team at Sony recorded live tracks and remixed 45 minutes of jazz tunes (which included a few new live parts and some new solos); another team at Pyramind Studios in San Francisco replaced old samples with better sounds in another 45 minutes of music and re-mixed all of the cut scenes in six languages; and finally the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra (MSO) recorded about 30 minutes of orchestral music.Melbourne Symphony OrchestraThe involvement of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra (MSO) in the orchestration of the Grim Fandango soundtrack grew out of several prior collaborations that McConnell had had with the orchestra. The connection first happened when Special Projects Manager of the orchestra Andrew Pogson reached out to McConnell in early 2013 to do a pops concert performance of Grim Fandango. At the time, McConnell had been working on the soundtrack for Broken Age, a new adventure game by Tim Schafer. Pogson, having been a financial backer for Broken Age, pushed to have MSO record that score, making it the first time for the MSO to be involved in such a project. After that collaboration coming to fruition, working together in orchestrating Grim Fandango became 'the next logical step' and it felt 'like working with old friends'. McConnell praised MSO, for their outstanding level of musicianship and focus and care; how they worked well together and reinforced yet again his notion from his early days in LucasArts that having a great team was of the highest value.During the original production of the score, McConnell had never imaged that it would one day be re-recorded with a live orchestra. That meant that his composition was unconstrained by considerations of flow and changes of tempo that a real orchestra would have to contend with. Rather, in order to make it sound more lively during the original digital production, McConnell had intentionally incorporated many tempo changes. While it would have been possible to do live recordings of full songs with big tempo changes, it would have required an intensive rehearsal, meaning more time and costs. So when the opportunity came to re-record with the MSO, McConnell tried to save time by planning the recording by breaking cues into smaller segments, recording those one at a time, and then put them back together like a puzzle.Pyramind studiosPyramind studios composers Clint Bajakian and Jeremy Garren imported McConnell's original audio mixes into Cubase 7 along with MIDI tracks that were assigned to modern sample libraries residing on two slave PCs running Vienna Ensemble Pro loaded with leading sample libraries. Bajakian also added live classical guitar parts that were not covered in 1998 using the same instrument he played back then. The team faced the challenge to adjust MIDI parameters to maximize realism and sonic quality while preserving McConnell's original artistic intent.To accomplish this, Garren noted that “this meant focused attention to mixing, EQ'ing, and programming articulation data on an individual instrument basis to bring each phrase and gesture in line with Pete's original intentions. It meant a constant back and forth with the original music and imagining, ‘What should this sound like today?’” and Bajakian added, “For us to do this right, we had to also wrap our minds around the ‘extra-musical’ content of the music – the concepts, the references, the puns – the ideas that interact like characters in a play”.OutcomeMcConnell noted that the one element that he and his team did not get 'so perfectly' in the original release was the film noir orchestral part and that that was what they were 'really able to do in a big way' with the remastering work. He also noted that between the remixes and the live symphony 'it turned out to be the score the way it was always meant to be heard', also adding that 'I have to say I'm glad I took extra care on the themes because I feel they were really able to blossom in the new live recordings.'McConnell estimated that he put in himself about 800 hours into the remastering project, in arranging, sample replacement, preparing for orchestration, mixing, and reviewing the music, resulting in over 2 hours of music that was completely overhauled, in addition to the 45 minutes of music the team had already recorded live in the original version. The outcome was described by McConnell as a score that had been 're-arranged, re-voiced, re-orchestrated, re-recorded, re-mixed, re-mastered and – most of all – retrieved' (and in a couple of key spots, even “re-composed').The stand-alone remastered soundtrack was released concurrently with the remastered game in 2015 (17 years after the original release). The soundtrack was distributed under Nile Rodgers' label Sumthing Else. In 2019, to celebrate the 20th anniversary, the remastered soundtrack was released in vinyl.Track listingsReleasesThe first stand-alone release of the soundtrack was in a CD in 1998. It contained 32 tracks totalling 43 minutes from the about 3 hours of the full length of the game score. An extended version of 128 tracks was later available online. 17 years later, in 2015, the remastered soundtrack was released. It was produced under Nile Rodgers' label Sumthing Else. It had a standard release of 37 tracks, as well as a Director's Cut with 14 extra tracks (the latter sold exclusively through Sumthing Else). It included the original score from the LucasArts archives, new compositions by Peter McConnell and new orchestral arrangements, as well as new extended versions of jazz pieces re-mixed at Sony Computer Entertainment America. In 2019, celebrating the 20th anniversary of the original release of the game, the soundtrack was released for the first time in vinyl format. It included all the songs of the 2015-release of the Director's Cut.Main albumsCompilations”' |class='wikitable' |- ! Name ! Date ! Label ! Format ! Catalog ! Notes !

Around 2015 McConnell prepared a suite of music for performance by the Queensland Symphony Orchestra. Celebrating its 20th anniversary, a live performance of script-reading with live music was performed at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2018. Later the same year, an evening gala was organized in tribute of the soundtrack during the inaugural edition of the Game Music Festival in the National Forum of Music of Poland. Parts of the score was performed live, with 100 pages of musical arrangements prepared by Bartosz Pernal in cooperation with McConnell, who attended and performed in the event. In 2018, Grim Fandango main theme song was one of the pieces performed by the Danish National Symphony Orchestra and subsequently included in the album Gaming in Symphony.LegacyGrim Fandangos soundtrack is considered a classic, receiving critical acclaim in its original release of 1998, and remaining a critics' favorite in ensuing years, including 17 years later in its remastered re-release in 2015. Its ability to 'glue' together the game's elements and 'elevate' it is seen as one of the high points of the video game music genre.The Grim Fandango score remained decades later one of McConnell's most famous scores (With 'Mr. Frustration Man' or 'Swanky Maximino' being some of his favorite pieces because of the solo performances). For McConnell personally, he saw this as a special project in his musical career, calling Grim Fandango 'almost like an opera' for how integrated the music was with the story. The project cemented a close working relationship between Schafer and McConnell that continued for decades after their work together at LucasArts.The fact that the soundtrack had stood the test of time, was attributed by McConnell to a combination of 'story and the world are so rich and potent, and deal with timeless themes on a level rarely attained in a game', the rich musical heritage of film noir scores and freedom of jazz, the talent of the musicians inspired by the musical effervescence of San Francisco's mission district; 'The score was literally in the air, like it was meant to be. All you had to do was catch it.' And while the video game soundtracks are meant to be created in support of the larger goal of an integrated interactive experience of dialogue, graphics, story, and sound, Grim Fandangos soundtrack also stands on its own, with critics noting that it can be appreciated independently of the game it was created for. The music was also performed for live audiences.The soundtrack is also notable for being one of the best examples of early adaptive music systems. With McConnell having created tracks for almost every location and character in Grim Fandango, these were weaved into a continuous sequence of music, seamlessly transitioning to different pieces as the player progressed through the game, making it the most cinematic soundtrack of any LucasArts game. This was accomplished with the use of the pioneering iMUSE software, previously created by McConnell and Michael Land, and it heralded the age of dynamic and cinematic music experiences in video games.Personnel McConnell dubbed the Grim Fandango score as 'the mission district score', as virtually all the performers and a lot of the inspiration came from it.Original releaseProduction team Peter McConnell – composer, producer Jeff Kliment – music engineering, mixing, lead sound design Hans Christian Reumschüssel – additional music productionMichael Land – sound production supervisionPerformers Ralph Carney – clarinet, bass clarinet, contrabass clarinet, slide clarinet, baritone and bass saxes Sheldon Brown – clarinet and bass clarinet Paul Hanson – bassoon, clarinet, alto and tenor saxes Bill Ortiz – trumpet Dan Armstrong – trombone Shane Norman – trombone Hans Christian – cello Clint Bajakian – classical guitar and melodica Peter McConnell – electric guitar, charango and violin (tango piece) Derek Jones – bass Paul van Wageningen – drums Jorge Molina – quena Geresh Cruden – tablasRemastered soundtrack – Additional creditsProduction Anthony Caruso – mixing (Sony Computer Entertainment America) Jonathan Mayer – mix project manager (Sony Computer Entertainment America)Camden Stoddard – mixing music with ambient sound effects for in-game play (Double Fine Productions) Clint Bajakian – midi re-orchestration and mixing, cutscenes mixing (Pyramind studios) Jeremy Garren – midi re-orchestration and mixing, cutscenes mixing (Pyramind studios) Jonathan Buch – midi re-orchestration and mixingMike Forst – cutscenes mixing (Pyramind studios), production manager Jonathan Buch – production assistant (Pyramind studios) Ophylia Wispling – production assistant (Pyramind studios)Melbourne Symphony recordings Performed by the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra Brett Kelly – conductor Andrew Pogson – special projects manager Haig Burnell – ABC producerChris Lawson – ABC sound engineer Nick Mierisch – ABC sound engineer Russell Thompson – ABC sound engineer Karim Elmahmoudi – orchestration Jory Prum - orchestral mixing, session engineer (Studio Jory) Joel Raabe - session engineer (Studio Jory)Data management Rob Cowles – original data safeguarding Derek Williams – original data recovery Jory Prum – original data retrievalAlbum art Holly Rothrock – 2019 vinyl release album artNotesReferencesFurther reading(LucasArts' official web page for Grim Fandango”, which included commentary on the music by its composer)External links Grim Fandango Remastered: The Resurrection of Sound with composer Peter McConnell - YouTube short documentary E3 Coliseum: Grim Fandango featuring Jack Black (YouTube) Performance of Grim Fandango's main theme by the Danish National Symphony Orchestra (YouTube) Original soundtrack listing provided by the Grim Fandango Network Grim Fandango original soundtrack, extended version (YouTube; 1:58:11) Grim Fandango live performance at GAMESCOM 2015 Cologne (organized by Video Games Live)Video game soundtracks Video games scored by Peter McConnell", "machine_text": " The music of Grim Fandango is composed by Peter McConnell and is an essential part of the noir adventure game of the same name, released in 1998 by LucasArts. It is set in a fusion of Mexican and film noir cultural contexts. McConnell, alongside fellow composer and sound designer Clint Bajakian, developed the sometimes electronic and sometimes jazz influences in the music of Grim Fandango to create an energetic and unique soundtrack. Grim Fandango incorporates a combination of original compositions and new, remixed Latin Jazz standards, most notably “Manny’s Theme”, the signature song of the game. McConnell said it was an attempt to replicate the recording style of 1940s/50s jazz musicians such as Stan Kenton and Duke Ellington. The soundtrack was released as part of the LucasArts Anthology CD, along with seven other LucasArts soundtracks. Tracks such as “Tierra del Sol” and “Estrada de la Muerte” features guitar and horns, while other tracks are heavily synthesized and based on the musical style of Carlos Santana. Grim Fandango was released with enhanced audio files, allowing it to be increasingly appreciated by modern gamers. In 2010, it was released on the iTunes Store for the first time, offering a much more vivid listening experience. The game's OST was voted the best of the year by the public, being placed in the top 25 videogame soundtracks of all time by gaming sites. In 2016, Peter McConnell and Skywalker Sound commended the game's 20th anniversary by releasing a remastered soundtrack, including original compositions and a full remake of “Manny's Theme” composed by Lynch. This version of the game's theme was especially composed for Grim Fandango Remastered, released in 2015. The music received near-universal praise from critics and fans, with The Sixth Axis commenting that it was “easily [..] one of the best soundtracks of any game, period”. Overall, the music of Grim Fandango is an essential element of the game and has been noticed as a hugely remarkable component of the game's overall influence.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 62707426}

Players assume the role of a homeowner in the game, tasked with using a variety of different plants to repel hordes of zombies from 'invading' their home. The idea is to help the homeowner build an arsenal of different plants and then utilize these plants to protect their house from the relentless zombie siege. The game is relatively simple in concept: the player is presented with a grid of squares, representing the homeowner's garden, upon which they can place various plants to thwart the zombie attacks. Each plant has its own special power, and the player must utilize the available plants in an attempt to fend off the zombie attacks. The player must also make strategic decisions in order to outsmart their opponents and survive the waves of zombies. The game also features other elements, which add a certain level of chaos and fun to the proceedings. The zombies themselves come in various shapes and sizes, and have their own special abilities, making them quite difficult to eliminate, as the player may need to use specific plants to take out certain enemies. There are also a few mini-games interspersed throughout the game as well, which can offer the player a breather from the main action in between waves. The graphics of the game are quite cartoonish and cheerful, helping to keep the game lighthearted and enjoyable. The sound effects are also of a high-quality and are particularly good at environmental atmospherics, such as the sound of birds chirping in the background. The music of the game is just as good, and fitting to the action taking place in each wave. There have been several versions of the game released since it first debuted in 2009, including a spin-off game, as well as mobile versions for iOS and Android devices. Plants vs. Zombies has been critically acclaimed since its launch, and is cited as one of the top tower defense games of all time. Thanks to its easy learning curve, engaging gameplay and polished presentation, Plants vs. Zombies is still highly regarded today, and is sure to delight gamers for many more years to come.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 67026877}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Battle of Ortenbach\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Battle of Ortenbach, also known as the Battle of Gengenbach, took place on 23 July 1678 during the closing stages of the 1672-1678 Franco-Dutch War, in the modern German state of Baden-Württemberg. It featured a French army commanded by François de Créquy and an Imperial force under Charles V, Duke of Lorraine.While in reality a skirmish, rather than a battle, Ortenbach was part of a series of events that enabled the French to secure Alsace and capture both Kehl and the crossing over the Rhine near the Imperial city of Strasbourg. The war ended in January 1679 when France and the Holy Roman Empire signed the Treaty of Nijmegen; Strasbourg was annexed by France in 1681.BackgroundIn the 1667-1668 War of Devolution, France captured most of the Spanish Netherlands and Franche-Comté, before the Triple Alliance of the Dutch Republic, England and Sweden forced them to relinquish most of these gains in the 1668 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. Angered by what Louis XIV viewed as Dutch ingratitude for previous French support, in May 1672 French forces invaded the Dutch Republic.They initially seemed to have achieved an overwhelming victory but by late July, the Dutch position had stabilised and they received support from Brandenburg-Prussia, Emperor Leopold and the Spanish Empire. This was formalised by the August 1673 Treaty of the Hague, which opened a new front in the Rhineland; despite being outnumbered, poor co-ordination between the Imperial armies and the skill of Turenne's skill allowed the French to retain the vital territory of Alsace.Turenne's death at Salzbach in 1675 forced the French onto the defensive and in September 1676, the Imperialists regained Philippsburg and control of the Rhine crossing at Strasbourg. During 1677, the new French commander de Créquy prevented them invading Alsace by astute manoeuvring; he won a minor battle at Kochersberg in October and then captured Freiburg im Breisgau.With peace negotiations nearing completion at Nijmegen, Louis planned a rapid campaign in March and April 1678 to strengthen his position in the Spanish Netherlands, remaining on the defensive elsewhere. De Créquy was instructed not to seek battle and ensure the retention of Freiburg; despite his successful defence of Alsace, Louis had limited confidence in him due to his defeat at Konzer Brücke in 1675 and subsequent loss of Trier. While an apparently minor defeat, it clearly rankled, since it was specifically mentioned in the eulogy delivered at Louis' funeral in 1715.In the spring of 1678, de Créquy concentrated his forces at Scherwiller, where he was reinforced by the Army of the Moselle under Schomberg. Charles of Lorraine began assembling an army of 30,000 outside Offenburg, intending to re-capture Freiburg and in late June, de Créquy sought to divert him by moving against Rheinfelden, now in Switzerland. Charles despatched Starhemberg and 7,000 men to its relief but the French caught them crossing the river, inflicting 3,000 casualties, many drowned, and taking 800 prisoners. After this success, Louis gave de Créquy permission to attack the main Imperial force, if he saw an opportunity to do so.The battleThroughout the war, the logistics support designed by Louvois allowed French armies to move faster and open campaigns much earlier, even during the winter, when armies traditionally halted operations due to lack of forage for cavalry and transport. This was enhanced by a systematic policy of denying supplies to the enemy through blockades and the destruction of towns, villages and farms.Their comparative advantage was particularly marked in the Rhineland, due to the weakness of the Imperial system and their armies' dependence on proximity to the Rhine for resupply. In May 1677, the English envoy in Vienna reported Charles of Lorraine was short of ammunition and his troops unable to survive more than three days away from the river.In the 1677 campaign, the Imperialists sustained severe losses from disease and hunger due to the strain placed on their supply lines by constant marching and counter-marching; Freiburg was captured in November because they were incapable of defending it. De Créquy now repeated this strategy; leaving Choiseul at Rheinfelden to reduce the remaining Imperial strongpoints and burn down Bad Säckingen, he returned to Bad Krozingen, 15 kilometres south-west of Freiburg. By mid July, most of the Imperial army was spread out between the villages of Gengenbach and Lahr, with forward elements at Denzlingen (see Map).As in the previous year, the Imperial army began to disintegrate due to disease and desertion forcing Charles to withdraw behind the Kinzig, a tributary of the Rhine providing a natural defence barrier in front of Offenburg. On 23 July, the French attempted to cross it but were prevented from doing so by the Imperial cavalry; this is the encounter known as the Battle of Ortenbach. Charles refused to commit his forces to a general engagement and retreated to Oberkirch but at the price of being cut off from the Rhine; on 27 July, de Créquy captured Kehl, its bridge over the Rhine and the associated fort of Etoile.Both the Dutch Republic and Spain had ended the war by mid-August but Emperor Leopold continued to delay in the hope of regaining some of his losses. Charles crossed back onto the left back of the Rhine at Philippsburg but found de Créquy once again blocking his advance. In late September, he admitted defeat and withdrew to the Electoral Palatinate, which ended the campaign.AftermathIn the January 1679 Treaty of Nijmegen, France retained Kehl and Freiburg-im-Breisgau; Emperor Leopold then further damaged relationships with his German allies by unsuccessfully demanding he be granted the Free Imperial Cities of Gengenbach, Zell-am-Harmersbach and Offenburg as 'compensation.'As the entry point into Alsace, Louis decided Strasbourg had to be annexed; de Créquy's 1678 campaign allowed him to blockade the city if needed and on 30 September 1681, French troops occupied the city. French possession of Strasbourg was confirmed by the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick but in return they withdrew from territories on the right bank of the Rhine, including Kehl and Freiburg.ReferencesSources;;;;;;Conflicts in 1678 Ortenbach Ortenbach 1678 in France Battle of Ortenbach Ortenbach", "machine_text": " The Battle of Ortenbachwas an armed confrontation that occurred on the 15th of May 1426, in the Ortenbach region of the now German province of Hesse. The battle pitted members of the Ortenbach Confederation, a collection of disparate forces led by the cities of Frankfurt and Würzburg, against forces loyal to the Archbishop of Mainz and the Bishop of Fulda. The battle was fought along the rural countryside surrounding the village of Ortenbach and resulted in a decisive victory for the Ortenbach Confederation. The origins of the Battle of Ortenbach can be traced back to the political upheaval that had been occurring in the German States throughout the early to mid 15th century. During this period, there were a series of struggles between small city-states, such as Frankfurt and Würzburg, and their overlords, the Archbishop of Mainz and the Bishop of Fulda. In 1426, these tensions escalated to the point of actual armed conflict. This conflict took shape in the form of the Battle of Ortenbach. The main combatants in the Battle of Ortenbach were the forces of the Ortenbach Confederation, mainly the cities of Frankfurt and Würzburg, and those of the Archbishop and Bishop of Mainz and Fulda (the Archbishop of Mainz also held the title of Elector Palatinate). The fighting began in the morning of the 15th of May, and lasted throughout the day. Eventually, the forces of the Ortenbach Confederation were victorious, driving back the main army of the Archbishop and Bishop. The aftermath of the Battle of Ortenbach saw the establishment of a long period of peace between the Ortenbach Confederation and their overlords. However, this period of peace did not last for long. In 1429, the Archbishop of Mainz and the Bishop of Fulda declared war on the Ortenbach Confederation, launching a new series of battles that would last for another two years. When the dust had settled in 1431, the Ortenbach Confederation held the upper hand. All of the gains from the Battle of Ortenbach, as well as the other battles that ensued, were vested in the Ortenbach cities which had become a regional power in their own right. The legacy of the Battle of Ortenbach, however, was more than just a series of battlefield victories. Instead, it was a lesson in how the combination of small but determined city-states could successfully challenge the authority of powerful overlords.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 59747434}

He was educated at Winchester and Oriel College, Oxford.Political career In 1841 FitzWalter claimed the ancient barony of FitzWalter, which had been in abeyance since 1756, as a descendant of Mary, sister of Benjamin Mildmay, 17th Baron FitzWalter. However, the House of Lords decided against terminating the abeyance in his favour. In February 1852 FitzWalter was elected to the House of Commons for Kent East, but lost the seat already in July the same year. He reclaimed the seat in 1857, and held it until 1868. The latter year he was created Baron FitzWalter, of Woodham Walter in the County of Essex.Family In 1834, Lord FitzWalter married his first cousin, Fanny, daughter of Lewis Cage and Fanny Bridges of Milgate Park, Kent. They had no children. She died in October 1874. Lord FitzWalter survived her by just over a year and died at Goodnestone Park, Goodnestone, in December 1875, aged 74.

He held considerable estates in Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex, was known as an adventurer and soldier, and greatly increased his landed interests following the wars of Edward I. He also appears to have appeared frequently in Parliament during the late 13th and early 14th centuries. In 1295 he was summoned to Parliament as Lord Fitzgerald, and in 1299 was granted the title 'Baron FitzWalter'. His tenure as Baron was short-lived, however, as he died without an heir in the early fourteenth century, and the title became extinct. He was buried in Butley Abbey in Suffolk. During his lifetime, he held considerable influence, and built a number of castles and towers throughout his estates, notably Tattershall Castle in Lincolnshire, and Great Yarmouth Castle in East Anglia. Bridges was allegedly responsible for diverting some of the waters from the River Waveney to create the lake at lake Tattershall, and appears to have been a major landholder in the area. He appears to have been a generous benefactor to many religious foundations, and in 1314 granted William de Waveringey the income from an annual fair at Forncet, Norfolk. In the same year, he granted permission to Roger de Lysle to found the chantry of St. Katherine at Tattershall. However, he does not appear to have built any religious establishments himself.

It is primarily used to describe the economic and social policies of the Nordic countries Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden. The Nordic model is distinguished from other types of welfare state systems by its emphasis on enhancing economic competitiveness and increasing economic participation. It is data-driven, goal-oriented and evidence-based. The countries combine market capitalism with a highly educated and skilled workforce, and one of the most generous social safety nets in the world. The Nordic model is seen as one of the most successful economic models for achieving economic and social prosperity. The Nordic countries tend to be highly productive. They have some of the highest GDP per capita and labor productivity levels in the world. This has been made possible by investments in education, technology and research and development, as well as by a commitment to workplace flexibility, collective bargaining agreements and the availability of universal welfare benefits. The decentralized nature of the Nordic model has channeled taxation toward the lowest-income brackets, and has liberalized certain areas of the labor market, such as flexible working hours, part-time employment and job sharing. This has helped to create dynamic companies as well as incentivize risk-taking and innovation. Social protection provided by the Nordic model also helps to moderate income disparities between workers. Family-friendly policies such as parental leave are also in place. Public spending in the Nordic countries has traditionally focused on areas such as education, health, child benefits and care for the elderly, rather than traditional welfare programs. The Nordic model has been praised by various international organizations, including the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and the World Economic Forum. It has also been favoured by some political parties in other countries. However, there have been criticisms of the Nordic model, particularly from conservatives who oppose the high level of taxation and spending required to sustain it, as well as its perceived lack of individual freedom. In conclusion, the Nordic model can be seen as a successful example of combining economic efficiency and competitiveness with a comprehensive welfare state and generous social protection programs. It is widely recognized by international organizations and political parties as providing a platform for economic and social success.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 11595783}

The oil sector shrank 5.3 percent this year in part due to a lack of demand as a result of the pandemic. Oil prices decreased to below 20 a barrel in April after the country entered an oil price war. While a truce among the world’s top oil producers has pushed the price of oil up to40 a barrel, this figure is still almost half the price of oil per barrel at the start of 2020. Furthermore, oil prices are significantly lower than the 76 a barrel the International Monetary Fund (IMF) says Saudi Arabia requires in order to balance its budget this year. In fact, the kingdom obtains more than three-quarters of its earnings from oil. The kingdom’s non-oil sector shrank by 8.2 percent in the second quarter, as quarantine constraints brought business activity to an almost complete standstill. While those restrictions have been eased, the government imposed harsh austerity measures in recent months and according to experts, this may lead to a slow recovery. According to the government, the unemployment rate soared to a record high of 15.4 percent. According to analysts, recovering from such a hit might be more difficult due to budget constraints as a result of declining oil prices.

He is remembered for his works on the subject of heraldry, which are generally considered to be some of the most complete and authoritative ever produced in the British Isles.Life Nisbet was born in Edinburgh, the third of ten children of Adam Nisbet WS and his wife Janet, only daughter of Alexander Aikenhead WS. Adam, and later Alexander, were chiefs of the ancient Nisbet family, of Nisbet in Berwickshire; however, the family had recently lost much of their wealth due to their zealous support of King Charles in the civil war, and had been forced to sell their ancestral estate. In his Essay on Additional Figures and Marks of Cadency, Nisbet remarks that he 'had a very early inclination to the study of herauldry, and when a boy ... looked on its figures with wonder, and often wish'd to know their names and signification.'Nisbet matriculated at Edinburgh University in 1675, where he studied philosophy. After graduating in 1682, he was employed as a solicitor for a number of years before giving it up in order to devote his full-time to his historical and heraldic studies. He later became a teacher, instructing various members of the nobility, including the Earl of Carnwrath.Around the turn of the 18th century he set out to create a comprehensive treatise on heraldry. He initially intended to obtain funding via subscription, but finding that this would not produce enough money, he appealed to the Scottish Parliament for help. Though they promised him £248 6s 8d, this was never delivered, and the passing of the Act of Union put paid to any chance of further parliamentary assistance. Nisbet's System of Heraldry was finally published in 1722, over twenty years after he had first set out to write the work. He died three years later, likely in poverty, and was buried close to the Nisbet Tomb in Greyfriars Kirk, though the exact location is now lost. His contemporary George Crawford wrote of him: 'he was a worthy, modest gentleman, who had as many friends and as few enemies as any man I have known.' In 1934 his kinsman Robert Chancellor Nesbitt arranged for John Buchan to unveil a memorial plaque in Greyfriars, which can still be seen today.Nisbet never married, and as such, the linear line of the Nisbets of that Ilk ended upon his death. The chiefly line was reestablished in 1995, in the favour of distant cousin Robert Anthony Ellis Nesbitt.PublicationsAn Essay on Additional Figures and Marks of Cadency.

Nisbet's many business ventures included coal mining, property development, livestock farming, and banking. His coal mining business in Torphins, Angus – Torphins Colliery Co. Ltd – was a particularly successful endeavour. Nisbet opened the quarry in 1895, founding the company a year later in 1896. He invested heavily in the company and its success enabled him to expand quickly. In time, the operation had grown to over 1,000 people employed at three quarries, with a further 750 employed to the associated railways. Nisbet's business ventures were not restricted only to coal mining, diversifying into a number of other industries such as, property development, railways and banking. He was a major investor in the Aberdeen Bank of Scotland and helped to establish banks all around Scotland and parts of England. Throughout his life, Alexander Nisbet also possessed a deep commitment to philanthropy. He was very generous in donating to schools, hospitals and churches. In 1913, he donated a substantial amount towards the development of the University of St Andrews.

Clarke also launched Formula Ford and thought that Formula F100 could be the sports car racing equivalent. The British press gave the F100 a far from warm welcome. The press feared the class would rival the popular Clubmans. The first season was dominated by Ray Allen driving a Royale RP4. The car was first powered by a Ford Kent engine. But when Nick Cole became the faster driver in a BMC powered Nerus Silhouette, Allen quickly changed engines. Former Formula 1 driver Les Leston came out of retirement to race in the series. The 49-year-old Briton was competitive towards the end of the season. The season started slow with few car counts, but at the end of the season there were 12 cars on the grid. The 1971 season was dominated by Tom Pryce. The young talent won eight of the 20 races. The series' final race at Brands Hatch on December 27, 1971 proved to be a farce as only one driver made the grid. The class eventually folded and the very popular Clubmans class prevailed.CarsThe lightweight sports cars were built by various manufacturers.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Slavink\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Slavink is a Dutch meat dish consisting usually of ground meat called 'half and half' (half beef, half pork) wrapped in bacon (the Dutch equivalent of bacon is, however, not smoked), and cooked in butter or vegetable oil for about 15 minutes. A variation of the dish called blinde vink is made by wrapping ground veal in a thin veal cutlet. Slavinken and blinde vinken are usually prepared and bought at the butchery or the supermarket; a standard slavink, before cooking, weighs around 100 grams. The bacon is 'glued' to the filling with transglutaminase, an enzyme that bonds proteins (and is usually extracted from animal blood).The slavink was first created by Butcher Jaap Boerwinkel in Amersfoort, and subsequently given its name by butcher Spoelder in Laren, which won him an award, the 'Golden Butcher's Ring.' Originally, the filling of a slavink was made from smoked sausage. The term 'slavink' loosely translates to Lettucefinch. The term is probably an abbreviation of slagersvink, that is, a 'finch' prepared by the butcher ('slager').The slavink often emblematizes traditional Dutch cuisine, as in the book De taal van de verpleging, a Dutch-language guide for non-native nurses working in the Netherlands, and is especially favored by the older generations.GalleryReferencesDutch cuisine Dutch words and phrases Pork dishes Bacon dishes", "machine_text": " Slavink (also known as fricadel, frikandel, frikkadel or Dutch frikadel) is a Dutch meat product, very similar to a hot dog, which is made from a combination of pig, beef and sometimes poultry meat. It is a pocket-sized meat product served in pairs, usually between buns. It was invented in the early 20th century, probably in the 1920s or 1930s according to some sources, with the aim of providing a cheap alternative to larger, more expensive forms of meat. It quickly rose to become one of the Dutch people's most beloved fast food dishes. The most popular version of Slavink is the single meat version, which is made from beef, pork fat, bread, eggs, onion and spices. This is the most widely available version in supermarkets and snack bars across the Netherlands, however there are many variations available including minced poultry, a fish version as well as vegetarian options. Slavink is usually served with a selection of fryable goods such as French fries, frikadelle (fried meatballs) and rookworst (Dutch smoked sausage). It is usually obtained from supermarkets, snack bars, bratwurst stores and also from fairs and markets. Slavink can be served with a variety of toppings such as curry ketchup, mayonnaise, or most commonly, a combination of both. The dish is very popular in the Netherlands, as well as Belgium and Germany. In recent years, it has also become an increasingly popular part of ex-pat Dutch and Belgium cuisine and is often served in the Netherlands-themed restaurants in the United Kingdom and United States. Although the exact origin of the Slavink is unknown, it is thought to be based on a Dutch meatball recipe that is over a century old. It is believed to be derived from the Dutch word 'slavink', which was an old Dutch term for meatballs. Slavink is an excellent example of how Dutch cuisine has evolved over the years, creating delicious dishes from simple ingredients. It is an iconic Dutch fast food that continues to be enjoyed today, both in the Netherlands and abroad.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 5211697}
