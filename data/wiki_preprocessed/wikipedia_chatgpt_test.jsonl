In essence, it is a connection between the algebraic and topological sides of operator theory.The formal statement of the theorem is as follows:Von Neumann bicommutant theorem. Letbe an algebra consisting of bounded operators on a Hilbert space , containing the identity operator, and closed under taking adjoints. Then the closures ofin the weak operator topology and the strong operator topology are equal, and are in turn equal to the bicommutantof .This algebra is called the von Neumann algebra generated by .There are several other topologies on the space of bounded operators, and one can ask what are the *-algebras closed in these topologies. Ifis closed in the norm topology then it is a C*-algebra, but not necessarily a von Neumann algebra. One such example is the C*-algebra of compact operators (on an infinite dimensional Hilbert space). For most other common topologies the closed *-algebras containing 1 are von Neumann algebras; this applies in particular to the weak operator, strong operator, *-strong operator, ultraweak, ultrastrong, and *-ultrastrong topologies.It is related to the Jacobson density theorem.ProofLetbe a Hilbert space andthe bounded operators on .

For any operatornot in S′, <OTx, y> - <TOx, y> is nonzero for some O in S and some x and y in . By the continuity of the abovementioned mapping, there is an open neighborhood ofin the weak operator topology for which this is nonzero, therefore this open neighborhood is also not in S′. Thus S′ is closed in the weak operator, i.e. S′ is weakly closed. Thus every commutant is weakly closed, and so is ; since it contains , it also contains its weak closure.Proof of (ii) This follows directly from the weak operator topology being coarser than the strong operator topology: for every pointin , every open neighborhood ofin the weak operator topology is also open in the strong operator topology and therefore contains a member of ; thereforeis also a member of .Proof of (iii) Fix .

The theorem establishes a deep relationship between the algebraic structure of a set of operators acting on a Hilbert space and its topology. The bicommutant of a set of operators A acting on a Hilbert space H is defined as the algebra generated by A and its adjoints, i.e., the set of all operators that commute with all elements of A and their adjoints. The von Neumann bicommutant theorem states that the bicommutant of A is equal to the weak operator closure of A, i.e., the set of all operators that can be approximated in the weak operator topology by a sequence of operators in A. The theorem has far-reaching consequences for the study of operator algebras. In particular, it implies that the topological properties of the bicommutant are determined by the algebraic properties of A. For example, if A is a *-subalgebra of the bounded operators on H, then its bicommutant is a von Neumann algebra, a type of C*-algebra that enjoys certain additional topological properties. The von Neumann bicommutant theorem also has applications in other areas of mathematics, including quantum mechanics, functional analysis, and topology. It has been used, for example, in the study of the structure of quantum states, the characterization of topological phases of matter, and the construction of noncommutative geometries. Despite its fundamental importance, the von Neumann bicommutant theorem is notoriously difficult to prove and its full generality remains an open problem. Nevertheless, it is widely regarded as one of the most beautiful and profound results in operator algebras, deserving of its place in the canon of mathematical masterpieces.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 455962}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Great Western Highway\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Great Western Highway is astate highway in New South Wales, Australia. From east to west, the highway links Sydney with Bathurst, on the state's Central Tablelands.Route The eastern terminus of the Great Western Highway is at Railway Square, at the intersection of Broadway with Quay Street, in the inner-city suburb of Haymarket and just south of the Sydney CBD. From Railway Square, the Great Western Highway follows Broadway south and west. At the western end of Broadway, it branches south-west into City Road (Princes Highway). The Great Western Highway proceeds west from this junction and its local name changes to Parramatta Road and heads generally west towards Parramatta. Hume Highway (Liverpool Road) branches south-west at Summer Hill/Ashfield, and a short distance further west the majority of traffic is diverted off the highway and onto the M4 Western Motorway via the WestConnex tunnel at Ashfield. A short distance further west, still at Ashfield, the A4 arterial road ends at a major junction with the Great Western Highway (Parramatta Road) and Frederick Street (which proceeds south to join Hume Highway).The highway continues west as Parramatta Road, with a major intersection at Homebush West with the A3 arterial road. Although the A3 road is called 'Centenary Drive' in this area, the on-/off-ramps are separately named Marlborough Road, carrying on the name of the surface road that was replaced by Centenary Drive. Further west, on the boundary between Lidcombe and Auburn, the highway intersects the A6 arterial road (St Hillier's Road / Silverwater Road).Just south of Parramatta, the highway meets Woodville Road and continues west onto an on-ramp for the M4 Western Motorway, while the highway-designated route turns sharply to the north along Church Street, before turning again at the southern fringe of the Parramatta central business district, and then continues due west across western metropolitan Sydney to , north of the central business district, where it crosses the Nepean River via the 1867 Victoria Bridge. At , the M4 Western Motorway reconnects with the Great Western Highway and the highway ascends the Blue Mountains. It intersects at Mount Victoria with the Darling Causeway which heads north to connect with the Bells Line of Road. From Mount Victoria, the highway descends via Victoria Pass into the Hartley Valley and then passes through the western suburbs of Lithgow where it is joined by the Chifley Road, which links eastward back to the Bells Line of Road. The highway continues generally west, intersecting with the Castlereagh Highway west of Marrangaroo, and crosses Coxs River to ascend the Great Dividing Range to reach its highest point (atjust east of Yetholme) and over the western ridge of the Sydney basin before dropping into the Macquarie Valley to reach its western terminus at Bathurst, at the junction of the Mitchell Highway and the Mid-Western Highway.At numerous points along its journey, the highway transverses or is transversed by the Main Western railway line. Major river crossings occur east of Emu Plains (Nepean), near Wallerawang (Coxs), and east of Bathurst (Macquarie).It consists of two of Australia's most historic roads – Parramatta Road, and the full length of the former Great Western Road, from Parramatta to Bathurst.HistoryColonial establishmentSydney CBD to Parramatta and PenrithInitial travel between Sydney and the settlement of Parramatta was by water along the Parramatta River. Sometime between 1789 and 1791 an overland track was made to provide an official land route between the two settlements. Parramatta Road dates to the 1792 formation of a route linking Sydney to the settlement of Parramatta, formalised under the direction of Surveyor-General Augustus Alt in 1797. Parramatta Road became one of the colony's most important early roadways, and for many years remained one of Sydney's premier thoroughfares. By 1810, Parramatta Road had officially open to traffic and was financed during a large portion of the 1800s by a toll, with toll booths located at what now is Sydney University and the Duck River.From Parramatta to Penrith, a road along the current alignment of the Great Western Highway (except atand Penrith) was constructed soon after completion of the Sydney-Parramatta Road.Emu Plains to Mount VictoriaIn 1813, acting on the instructions of Governor of New South Wales Lachlan Macquarie, Gregory Blaxland, William Lawson and William Wentworth led an 1813 expedition that travelled west from Emu Plains and, by staying to the ridges, were able to confirm the existence of a passable route directly west from Sydney across the Blue Mountains. The existence of other, less direct routes had been known as far back as 1797, but due to the need to prevent convicts from believing that escape from the hemmed-in Sydney region was possible, knowledge of the expeditions confirming the existence of routes across the Blue Mountains was suppressed. Blaxland, Lawson and Wentworth travelled as far west as the point they named Mount Blaxland,southwest of where Lithgow now stands. From this point they were able to see that the worst of the almost impenetrable terrain of the Blue Mountains was behind them, and that there were easy routes available to reach the rolling countryside they could see off to the west.Mount Victoria to BathurstMacquarie then despatched Surveyor George Evans to follow Blaxland, Lawson and Wentworth's route and to push further west until he reached arable land. Evans travelled west until he reached the Fish River, and followed it downstream until he reached the site of Bathurst. Within a year, Macquarie commissioned William Cox to construct a road west from Emu Plains, following Evans' route, and this road was finished in 1815. Macquarie himself travelled across it soon after completion, established and named Bathurst, and named the road the Great Western Road.The section of the Great Western Road as far west as , with a small number of minor deviations, is still in use today as part of the Great Western Highway. West of Mount Victoria, Evans' route has been superseded, chiefly by Mitchell's new route constructed between 1832 and 1836.Route development Between present-dayand Dog Trap Road (now Woodville Road), Parramatta Road travelled in a wide arc up tosouth of the present route, to avoid marshy areas around Haslams Creek and Duck River. Continuing due west from Flemington, it crossed Duck River near the present Mona Street bridge, turning north near the present Granville Park to finish at George Street in Parramatta, between Pitt and Church Streets. This was deviated circa 1840 to follow the present route. Few traces of the original route remain.At Mount Victoria, at the western edge of the Blue Mountains, the route of Cox's road turned north to Mount York, from where it descended into the Hartley Valley. This pass was the major piece of engineering on the original route, and when Macquarie travelled the new road in 1815, he named it Cox's Pass in honour of the builder. From the foot of Mount York the road resumed its westerly direction to wherenow stands. However, from here it ran via the present-day Glenroy, Mount Blaxland, Cut Hill Road, Pitts Corner, Phils Falls, Mount Olive Rd, Carlwood Road and Sidmouth Valley to a pointsouth of . From here it continued westward, not crossing the Fish River, but crossing Campbells Rivernorth of the present bridge at The Lagoon and ascending to another ridgeline where it turned north to Gormans Hill, to reach the future site of Bathurst from the south, not the east.For the first one hundred years after this ceased to be the route of the Great Western Road it remained trafficable, but the destruction of the bridge at Phil's Falls on the Fish River in 1930 meant it was no longer a through route, and parts became untrafficable. However, most of this route remains in existence as a series of local roads.The original route had only been in existence for eight years when, in 1823, Assistant Surveyor James McBrian identified an improved route on the approaches to Bathurst. This route turned northsouth of O'Connell to run northwest to whereis now located, then west across the Macquarie River into Bathurst. The section from south of O'Connell to Kelso is now part of the Bathurst-Oberon Road, and from Kelso into central Bathurst still remains as part of the Great Western Highway.When Major Thomas Mitchell was appointed as Surveyor-General in 1828, one of the first matters to which he turned his attention was the improvement of the Great Western Road. Mitchell's attention was focussed on providing a more direct and easily graded route for the Great Western Road. To this end, he surveyed a route running northwest from Hartley via Mt Walker to Meadow Flat, crossing the Great Dividing Range at Mount Lambie, then running in an almost straight line westward via Browns Hill to Kelso, to meet the pre-existing road. This road remains in existence – from Mount Lambie west it remains as the route of the current Highway (with deviations) but the section adjacent to Cox's River was inundated by the construction of Lake Lyell for Wallerawang Power Station in the late 1970s.Mitchell was also concerned to improve the worst sections of the road, which were the climb from the Cumberland Plain, on which Sydney sits, and the descent of Mount York, down the western side of the Blue Mountains.In improving the eastern ascent Mitchell adhered largely to Cox's route, which follows the southern side of an east-falling gully to reach the plateau at whereis now located. However, he engaged Scottish engineer David Lennox to build a stone arch bridge, now the Lennox Bridge, across the mouth of a particularly deep side gully. This route, known as Mitchell's Pass, was completed in 1833 and superseded what is now called Old Bathurst Road, located to the north of the route. The Mitchell's Pass and Lennox Bridge served as the main route to the Blue Mountains for 93 years until 1926, when the Great Western Highway was re-routed via sections of the former Lapstone Zig Zag including the Knapsack Viaduct.After protracted arguments first with Governor Ralph Darling and then his successor Richard Bourke, and ignoring orders, Mitchell surveyed, designed and had built what is now known as Victoria Pass, where the highway drops from the Blue Mountains into the Hartley Valley. Midway down the road had to be supported on a causeway formed by massive stone buttressed walls, where a narrow ridge connects two large bluffs. This ridge had to be widened and raised to give the highway a route from the upper to the lower bluff. Mitchell cut terraces into the sides of these bluffs to form a passage for the road. It is a testimony of Mitchell's vision and engineering skill that this route, almost unchanged, and using his 1832 stonework, is still in use. Because this pass brought the road into the Hartley Valley several kilometres south of the Mount York descent, it necessitated a new route as far west as Hartley to meet Cox's Road. This also is still in use as part of the highway.In 1929 the Main Roads Board deviated the route north from Old Bowenfels to Marrangaroo, using trunk road 55 (Mudgee Road). From Marrangaroo a new road was built westward, running south of Wallerawang to meet Mitchell's 1830 deviation immediately east of Mount Lambie. This route avoids the long, steep gradients either side of Cox's River, which were the main drawback of Mitchell's route.The Great Western Highway today therefore consists of Parramatta Road to Parramatta, the Great Western Road to Emu Plains, Coxs Road to Hartley (other than Mitchell's deviations atand Mount York), Mitchell's route from Hartley to Old Bowenfels, the Main Roads Board route from Old Bowenfels to Mount Lambie, Mitchell's road from Mount Lambie to Kelso, and McBrian's road from Kelso to central Bathurst.ImprovementsEarly improvements The first recorded major improvement to the route of the Great Western Highway was the construction in 1806 of ten bridges along Parramatta Road.In attempts to improve the gradient of the descent from the Blue Mountains plateau to the floor of the Hartley Valley, Lawson's Long Alley was opened in 1824. This still did not prove satisfactory and construction of a second deviation, known as Lockyer's Pass, was commenced. However this route was not completed, as its construction was abandoned in favour of construction of Mitchell's route via Victoria Pass.Originally the Great Western Road crossed the Nepean River at Penrith by means of a ferry adjacent to the Log Cabin Hotel. This was superseded in 1856 by a bridge which was destroyed by a flood in 1857. A second bridge was opened in 1860, and was destroyed by the record flood of 1867. In the same year a new bridge, Victoria Bridge, was nearing completion adjacent to the road crossing, as part of the Penrith-Weatherboard (Wentworth Falls) section of the Main Western Railway. Its deck was modified to accommodate road traffic as well as the single-track railway. This bridge continued in dual use until 1907 when the current steel truss railway bridge was built alongside, and the 1867 bridge was given over solely to road traffic. This bridge remains in use for the Great Western Highway. The design of this bridge is almost identical to that of the 1863 Menangle Railway Bridge, also over the Nepean River.In 1870 the Denison Bridge, a wrought iron truss bridge, was built across the Macquarie River at Bathurst. This replaced an earlier wooden bridge.Early 20th Century improvements In the first few years of the 20th century the railway overpasses between Lapstone Hill and Mount Victoria were replaced as part of the duplication of the Main Western railway. These bridges were of brick arch construction. They were in turn replaced in the mid-1950s to obtain the necessary height clearances for overhead wiring for the electrification of the Main Western Railway from Penrith to Bowenfels.In 1912 Victoria Pass was superseded by Berghofers Pass, which followed a similar route to Victoria Pass, but below it. It was more winding and thus longer, thereby affording a less steep climb. However rapid improvements in motor vehicle performance meant that in 1920 Victoria Pass was rebuilt to become the main route again.After the ascent of the eastern escarpment by the Main Western Railway was deviated for the second time in 1913 to its current route via Glenbrook Gorge, the Great Western Road was also deviated at this point for a second time in 1926 by the then Main Roads Board, which rerouted it via the disused 1867 stone arch railway viaduct across Knapsack Gully and around the southern side of Lapstone Hill to gain the first plateau in the ascent of the Blue Mountains. As this viaduct had held only a single railway track, its deck was widened in 1939 to its present two lane configuration. The viaduct was closed to motor traffic when the M4 motorway was extended west from Russell Street to connect to the Highway at Lapstone in 1994.West of Knapsack Gully, although now widened to four lanes, the 1926 route of the highway is still in use. It uses a long stretch of abandoned railway formation – the section from Zig Zag Street to Blaxland station is located on the original 1867 railway alignment. An indication of the need to divert the railway can be gained from the gradient of the highway as it climbs west from Hare St to Lovett Street.A number of deviations were built in 1929:at Haslams Creek, , to straighten the road and provide a new bridgebetweenand , to remove an underpass and an overpass of the railway from the route of the highwayat Eusdale, Yetholme (in three sections) and Melrose (all west of Meadow Flat), to ease gradients.In 1930 the level crossing at Bowenfels was replaced by an underpass.Victoria Pass was upgraded in 1932 to give a constant width of 8.5 m, with a minor deviation built at the foot of the pass.Upgrading since World War II In 1957 a short deviation immediately west of Linden eliminated two narrow overpasses of the railway, both of which had right angle bend approaches from both directions. These bridges would have had to have been replaced in any event to allow for overhead wiring for the electrification to Bowenfels of the Main Western Railway. Such replacements occurred east of Linden, further west of Linden near Bull's Camp, east of Lawson, at Medlow Bath and east of Mount Victoria, and in these cases the replacement bridges were located at a skew angle to eliminate right angle bend approaches, with the earlier bridges left for pedestrian use.In 1958 the 'Forty Bends’, where the Highway runs along the foot of Hassans Walls approaching Lithgow, were eased. The fact that this section of the Highway is on the southern side of a very high escarpment poses severe ice problems during winter, due to the lack of sunlight.In the early 1960s the highway was deviated east of Leura to cross under the railway at Scott Parade (which was itself part of the former highway route) and run along the north side of the railway to rejoin the previous route at Leura Mall.In 1967, the highway was deviated to bypass Springwood shopping centre, eliminating two narrow underpasses of the railway from the highway route. The previous route remain in use for local traffic as Macquarie Road. In 1968 a dual carriageway 3 km deviation was opened at Prospect. This replaced the only winding section of the Highway between Parramatta and Penrith. The bypassed section was heritage-listed in 2014 as the best-preserved section of the 1818 alignment.From the late 1960s to the early 1970s the highway was almost entirely realigned and constructed to three lanes, being deviated as necessary, between Kirkconnell and Glanmire. Ironically this included reinstatement of most of the parts of Major Mitchell's 1830 alignment which had been deviated in 1929 to ease gradients.This work was extended eastward to Mount Lambie in stages during the late 1980s and early 1990s. A second Cox's River deviation, to replace the 1929 deviation, was completed in 1993, between Marrangaroo and Mount Lambie.At Katoomba the highway was deviated in 1985 to travel along the eastern side of the railway station, whereas the original alignment crossed the railway via a level crossing at the north end of Katoomba Street and ran along the western side of the railway. Immediately west of where the highway now crosses the railway due to this deviation, the highway was realigned over a distance of 1 km in 2004 to remove the sharp bend at 'Shell Corner'.In Bathurst, the Denison Bridge (1870) was bypassed in 1991 by a realignment of the Highway where it crosses the Macquarie River into Bathurst city centre. Because of its heritage value it was retained for use by cyclists and pedestrians.During 1991–1993 a massive cutting was made to improve and widen the alignment of the highway immediately east of Woodford. At the top of the southern side of this cutting can be seen the rudimentary excavation of the rock for Cox's 1815 road. This was severed in 1868 by the construction of the Springwood-Mount Victoria section of the Main Western Railway. The railway itself was deviated at this point in the 1920s when it was duplicated, and a cutting on the original alignment of the railway now forms the top section of the southern face of the highway cutting, the terrace in the face of the cutting being the bed of the original cutting.In June 1993 the highway route was severed at Emu Plains with the closure to road traffic of the Knapsack Gully Viaduct. This occurred in conjunction with the westward extension of the M4 motorway from its terminus since 1971 at Russell Street, Emu Plains. This extension connects directly to the highway at Lapstone, bypassing the viaduct. The portion of the Great Western Highway west from Russell Street to Mitchells Pass Road is now only used by local traffic to access residential properties. Mitchells Pass, travelling is now one way eastbound between Lennox Bridge and the highway, due to its narrowness. Great Western Highway traffic therefore has to use the M4 between Russell St and Governors Drive.A major realignment west from Mount Boyce (the highest point on the highway) to eliminate the Soldiers Pinch and other nearby sharp curves was completed in 2002.Duplication and widening From Railway Square to Woodville Road, the highway was widened to its present width when it was reconstructed in reinforced concrete in the 1930s. From Woodville Road west to The Northern Road the highway was widened, generally progressively westward, from the mid-1960s to the late 1970s. This section is a combination of six lanes with median strip, six lanes with wide landscaped median, and four lanes undivided. At The Northern Road in Kingswood the highway reverts to a four lane undivided configuration through Penrith shopping centre, widens to six lanes at the Castlereagh Road intersection, reverts to two lanes west from Castlereagh Road to Russell Street, and is then four lanes undivided with sealed shoulders from Russell Street to the base of Mitchells Pass, where it has been truncated.Between 1981 and 2015 the NSW Government RoadsMaritime Services duplicated the highway betweenandwest of Katoomba, generally working westward. This work incorporated the dual carriageway Springwood bypass, opened in 1967.West of Katoomba, there is a furtherof dual carriageway on the River Lett Hill, andof dual carriageway from Magpie Hollow Road at Old Bowenfels to Lidsdale State Forest. This was completed as follows:road widening and realignment completed in 2006 River Lett Hill 2014/15 Old Bowenfels to Bowenfels completed in sections during the late 1990s Bowenfels to Marrangaroo Creek mid-1970s Marrangaroo interchange with the Castlereagh Highway 1970 Marrangaroo interchange to Lidsdale State Forest (second Cox's River deviation) 1993.Four-lane undivided sections are theof Victoria Pass (except for Mitchell's 1832 causeway, which is two lanes), and from Boyd Street into the terminus of the highway at its junction with the Mitchell and Mid Western Highways in West Bathurst (parts have a raised median strip).From Lidsdale State Forest as far west as Glanmire most of the highway is three lanes, with almost continuous overtaking lanes alternating between eastbound and westbound.Current projectsRepairs and enhancements from Victoria Pass to Lithgow. The bridge at Victoria Pass is being refurbished and kept as two lane (one each direction.)Forty Bends upgrade (from top of River Lett Hill to Magpie Hollow Road) – consists of extension of the length of three-lane pavement and measures to reduce the incidence of black ice in winterDuplication from Ashworth Drive to Stockland Drive Kelso (in Bathurst).Route numbers When the national route numbering system was introduced in 1954, the full length of the Great Western Highway was designated as part of national route 32 (Sydney-Adelaide via Dubbo and Broken Hill), with the section from City Road to the Hume Highway (Liverpool Road) Summer Hill also being part of national route 31.Current numbering is extremely confusing, as follows: City Road to Hume Highway (Liverpool Road) Ashfield – A22, following the introduction of the 'Metroads' in the late 1990s. Before M5 East was opened in late 2001 it was Metroad 5. After 2001 it was State Route 31. Liverpool Road, Ashfield to Wattle Street, Haberfield – no route number since the diversion via Stage 3, City-West Link on 2 June 2000. Wattle Street, Haberfield to M4 Western Motorway intersection at Strathfield – A44, following the opening of M4 East in July 2019. Before this, it was part of the A4. M4 Western Motorway intersection at Strathfield to Russell Street, Emu Plains – A44. Russell Street-M4 at Lapstone (Knapsack Viaduct now closed) – no number. M4 at Lapstone to intersection of Mitchell and Mid Western Highways in Bathurst (end of Great Western Highway) – A32.The A32 continues along the Mitchell Highway as far as Nyngan, then follows the Barrier Highway to Gawler,north of Adelaide, where it connects with the Sturt Highway (A20). The Mid Western Highway is A41 or B64 over its full length of Bathurst to , where it meets the Sturt Highway (A20) and Cobb Highway (B75).Route number changes Before the North Strathfield-Mays Hill and Huntingwood-Emu Plains sections of the then Western Freeway were joined by the construction of the missing link from Mays Hill to Huntingwood, the section of the highway between Reservoir Road, Huntingwood and Russell Street, Emu Plains was signposted as national route 32.When Metroads were introduced, the highway east of North Strathfield and the full length of the Freeway were designated as Metroad 4.The section of highway from Wattle St to the Liverpool Rd became unnumbered following the opening of the final stage of the City-West Link, so that Metroad 4 commenced under freeway conditions at Anzac Bridge, joining the Harbour Bridge and Cross-City Tunnel.From the introduction of the Metroads until the opening of the M5 East (General Holmes Drive to King Georges Road) in 2001, the part of the highway between Railway Square and the Hume Highway was designated as part of Metroad 5.When the M5 East was completed, the Metroad 5 designation was assigned to the freeway; those parts of the highways (both Great Western/Hume Highway) which had been part of Metroad 5 were then given over to a logical continuation of State Route 31 east beyond Metroad 3, which is now designated A22. From North Strathfield to Russell Street, Emu Plains the highway is now A44 (as is the section of Russell Street from the Highway to the M4).When M4 East opened between Strathfield and Haberfield in July 2019, the M4 designation was rerouted onto the new motorway. As a result, the section of Great Western Highway/Parramatta Road between Strathfield and Haberfield was designated A44, replacing the previous A4 designation.Former route numbers The Hume Highway has many former route allocations including former National Route 32.Where and when the former route numbers were implemented are stated below.Chippendale – Summer Hill:National Route 31Metroad 4National Route 32Metroad 5State Route 31A22Summer Hill – Haberfield:National Route 32Metroad 4unallocated:Haberfield – North Strathfield:National Route 32Metroad 4A4A44North Strathfield – Auburn:National Route 32State Route 44A44Auburn – Clyde:National Route 32State Route 44A44Clyde – Granville:National Route 32State Route 44A44Granville – Mays Hill:National Route 32State Route 44A44Mays Hill – Prospect:National Route 32State Route 44A44Prospect – Eastern Creek:National Route 32State Route 44A44Eastern Creek – Emu Plains:National Route 32unallocated:State Route 44A44Emu Plains – Lapstone :National Route 32Metroad 4M4Lapstone – Bathurst:National Route 32A32Route names From Sydney to Blue Mountains:BroadwayParramatta Road (officially renamed Great Western Highway in 1928) Church Street (officially renamed Great Western Highway in 1928) Great Western Highway Henry Street High Street Great Western Highway Russell Street Great Western HighwayMajor junctionsSee alsoHighways in AustraliaHighways in New South WalesReferencesHighways in New South Wales Highways in Sydney Streets in Sydney Transport in the Blue Mountains (New South Wales)", "machine_text": "Great Western Highway is a major east-west route of New South Wales, Australia. The highway is approximately 220 kilometers long and connects Sydney to the central western regions of the state. It is known as the A32 highway in the Australian road network. The Great Western Highway is a significant component of the National Highway that runs across Australia's eastern coast. The construction of the Great Western Highway began in the early 19th century, and it has undergone several upgrades and renovations since then. In its earlier days, it was primarily used to transport wool and other agricultural products from rural areas to Sydney. Today, it serves as a crucial link between the commercial center of Sydney and the developing inland regions. The Great Western Highway starts at the foot of the Blue Mountains, in Emu Plains. It passes through several towns and cities, including Katoomba, Lithgow, Bathurst, and Orange, before connecting to the Mitchell Highway. From there, it continues westward to Dubbo, Nyngan, and Bourke. The highway is a scenic drive, traversing the picturesque Blue Mountains and passing through several natural reserves. One of the highlights of the Great Western Highway is its passage through the Blue Mountains National Park. The park features numerous waterfalls, towering cliffs, and native vegetation that attracts countless visitors year-round. The Great Western Highway has played an essential role in the development of New South Wales, connecting the urban and rural communities, and providing a vital link for commerce and transport. The road handles significant traffic and has undergone substantial renovations to improve its safety, capacity, and functionality. Despite its upgrades, the Great Western Highway remains an integral part of New South Wales's transportation infrastructure and will continue to serve the state's needs for years to come.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 613730}

The Mediterranean Sea is a crucial route for international trade, and it maintains significant socio-economic and geostrategic importance for the countries that border it. However, it has also become a playground for various criminal and terrorist organizations, which have been exploiting the sea to carry out their activities. Several factors have contributed to this ongoing alert in the Mediterranean, including the current Syrian refugee crisis, political instability in North Africa and the Middle East, and the emergence of new terrorist groups such as ISIS. The countries of the Mediterranean region have taken several measures to counter these threats, including strengthening their border controls, increasing surveillance of the sea, and enforcing stricter maritime laws. The European Union has also taken significant steps to tackle these challenges through its Mediterranean mission, known as Operation Sophia. The mission aims to counter human trafficking and smuggling of weapons in the Mediterranean and to disrupt the business model of criminal networks. It involves the deployment of naval assets and personnel to patrol the Mediterranean, identify vessels involved in illegal activities, and take necessary action. Furthermore, several international organizations, including the United Nations and NATO, have also played a crucial role in addressing the challenges in the Mediterranean. These organizations have been involved in initiatives to improve the security situation in the region, to provide humanitarian assistance to refugees, and to promote regional stability through dialogue and cooperation. In conclusion, the alert in the Mediterranean is an ongoing process, and it requires the collective efforts of all the countries and international organizations involved.

Headquartered in Rome, it is headed by the Minister of Justice.BackgroundIn Italy, there is no strict equivalent of an Attorney General and all comparisons risk being misleading due to the differences in the constitutional and legal systems. As a result, the very approximate equivalent of a U.S. Attorney General would be the Ministro della Giustizia who is a member of the government and head of the Italian Department of Justice. Also, the English Attorney General has no direct equivalent—as the function of legal adviser to the government does not exist as such, and part of its responsibilities are in the Avvocato Generale dello Stato, who is in charge of representing the State in any civil, criminal or administrative lawsuit, but not in charge of prosecution.Prosecution in Italy enjoys constitutional independence from the Government, and is entrusted to a district attorney, the Procuratore della Repubblica (one for every ordinary court), the Procuratore Generale (every Court of Appeal), the Procuratore Distrettuale Antimafia, the Procuratore Generale (Court of Cassation) and the Procura Nazionale Antimafia.The Italian Ministry of Justice is the ministerial department of the Judicial branch of the Italian government. The Ministry of Justice is the department in power in regards to the formulation of judicial policies. The department is led by the elected Minister of Justice.The Minister of Justice is a senior member of the cabinet. Currently, the woman who holds the position is Maria Cartabia.The Ministry of Justice is led by two fundamental functions that are enumerated in the Italian constitution: the organization of the services related to the judiciary and the responsibility to take disciplinary actions against a judge. All other functions are detailed through ordinary state laws.Article 110 of the Italian Constitution explicitly states that the organization and operation of services concerned with the administration of law are entrusted to the Minister ofJustice. The minister is entrusted by the parliament as well as the council of ministers, to carry out the administration ofcorrect governance as a means of checks and balances in the country. He also has the power of legislative initiative and the competence to create or remove judiciary.The Ministry of Justice carries out its fundamental functions within the central structures, such as Rome, and in the judicial offices, tribunals, and courts. The judicial courts are composed of a chief magistrate and a court manager. The chief magistrate heads the judiciary and has the last say on judicial office decisions. The court manager serves as internal assistance to the judge and public prosecutors. The Italian judiciary is divided into three departments: inferior courts, intermediate appellate courts, and courts of last resort. The vertical and hierarchical structure of the courts of the judicial system is mitigated by the esteemed judges and prosecutors of the Superior Council of Magistrates.DivisionsPolizia PenitenziariaSee alsoList of Ministers of Justice (Italy)ReferencesExternal linksMinistry of JusticeMinistry of Justice(Archive)Justice Rome R.

The Ministry of Justice is responsible for the development and implementation of policies and legislation related to the judicial system, including the courts, prisons, and other legal institutions. It also manages the organization of the judiciary, including the appointment of judges and prosecutors, as well as the administration of judicial staff. The Ministry also oversees the development and implementation of policies for the rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders. The Ministry of Justice's main priority is the protection of citizens' rights and ensuring the effectiveness and efficiency of the judicial system. To achieve this, the Ministry works closely with other government departments and institutions, such as the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to develop and implement policies that promote the rule of law and protect civil liberties. Another important task of the Ministry is to ensure the proper functioning of Italy's prison system. The Ministry oversees the country's correctional facilities and is responsible for implementing rehabilitation programs for prisoners aimed at minimizing recidivism rates. The Ministry of Justice also plays a vital role in implementing Italy's international obligations on issues related to justice and human rights. The Ministry represents the country in various international organizations, such as the Council of Europe, the United Nations, and the European Union, and works to promote Italy's legal interests and international cooperation in the field of justice.

In other words, it is a type of cognitive bias in which a person is convinced of something that is not based on reality. The delusional intuition can manifest in different ways. Some people may have a persistent belief that they have a special power or ability that others do not possess, while others may be convinced that they are being followed by government agents or aliens. Some may believe that they are in a romantic relationship with a celebrity, or that they have a divine mission to save the world. Delusional intuition is not a mental disorder in and of itself, but rather a symptom of many psychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and paranoia. It can also be caused by drugs or alcohol abuse, brain injuries, and neurological disorders. The diagnosis and treatment of delusional intuition depend on the underlying condition causing the symptom. In some cases, medication and therapy are effective in reducing the intensity of delusions and helping individuals cope with reality. In some extreme cases, hospitalization may be required to prevent harm to the individual or others. It is important to note that individuals with delusional intuition are not intentionally lying or deceiving others; they genuinely believe in their delusions. It is crucial to approach the person with empathy and understanding. Engaging in an argument or trying to convince the person that their belief is incorrect is usually unhelpful and may worsen their symptoms. In conclusion, delusional intuition is a psychological phenomenon that can be distressing for the individuals experiencing it, their families, and their social network. It is a symptom of various psychiatric conditions and should be treated with compassion and understanding.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 34413419}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Odeonsplatz\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Odeonsplatz is a large square in central Munich which was developed in the early 19th century by Leo von Klenze and is at the southern end of the Ludwigstraße, developed at the same time. The square is named for the former concert hall, the Odeon, on its northwestern side. The name Odeonsplatz has come to be extended to the parvis (forecourt) of the Residenz, in front of the Theatine Church and terminated by the Feldherrnhalle, which lies to the south of it. The square was the scene of a fatal gun battle which ended the march on the Feldherrnhalle during the 1923 Beer Hall Putsch.Location and buildings The Odeonsplatz is located north of the Old Town, on the border between Altstadt-Lehel (to the east) and Maxvorstadt (to the west). On the west side, which is set back from the line of the Ludwigstraße,are the building of the Odeon (1826–28, now the Bavarian Ministry of the Interior) and the identical Palais Leuchtenberg (1817–21, now the Bavarian State Ministry of Finance), both modelled on the Palazzo Farnese in Rome. On the east side is Klenze's Bazaar Building, including the Café Tambosi. Between the two buildings on the west side, an unnamed street leads to the Palais Ludwig Ferdinand (1825–26, now the headquarters of Siemens). Both this street and the Brienner Straße, which begins at the south end of the square, lead to the adjacent Wittelsbacherplatz, also designed by Klenze.The Feldherrnhalle is a copy of the famous Loggia dei Lanzi in Florence.The Odeonsplatz is served by the U Bahn station of the same name and by the Museenlinie (museum line) of the Munich bus system. Since 1972, the southern end of the square has been part of the central Munich pedestrian zone.HistoryAs early as 1790, plans were made in connection with the removal of the old city walls to replace the Schwabing Gate (Schwabinger Tor) with a new square and to make the beginning of the route from the Residenz to Nymphenburg Palace (the Fürstenweg, now Brienner Straße) more impressive. The current form of the square and the parvis to the south of it was determined by King Ludwig I of Bavaria, who in 1816, while still Crown Prince, commissioned Klenze to lay out the whole of the Ludwigstraße, including the square at its southern end. The Italianate neo-classical style of the first building, the Palais Leuchtenberg, set the tone, and unlike earlier plans by Friedrich Ludwig von Sckell which had featured buildings surrounded by a parklike setting, Klenze created an enclosed urban square to better fit with the adjacent Old Town. However, the Feldherrnhalle, erected to close the view at the southern end on the site of the demolished gate, was commissioned from Klenze's rival Friedrich von Gärtner in 1840–41. As the building of the square continued, the project expanded to include the new Ludwigstraße; originally it had been intended as a central square. As a result, the obelisk in memory of the Bavarian troops who had died fighting with Napoleon in his Russian campaign was instead erected in the Karolinenplatz in 1833. In 1862 an equestrian statue of Ludwig I was added at the mouth of the street between the Odeon and the Palais Leuchtenberg; it was designed by Ludwig von Schwanthaler and executed by Max von Widnmann.The Odeonsplatz has traditionally been an important site of parades and public events, including funeral processions (most recently for Franz Josef Strauss in 1988), victory parades (most recently for the Bavarian troops who took part in the Franco-Prussian War of 1871), which proceeded down the Ludwigstraße to the Feldherrnhalle, with the VIP rostrum usually being located at the statue of Ludwig I. The annual parade to the Oktoberfest still follows this route.According to many historians, this traditional function was the reason for the Nazi march on the Feldherrnhalle on 9 November 1923 in the course of the Beer Hall Putsch, which ended in a gunfight in which four state police officers and 16 Nazis were killed. During the Third Reich, the annual memorial march passed through the square and continued to the Königsplatz, where the Nazi fallen had been interred. A memorial was erected for them to the east of the Feldherrnhalle, which all passersby were required to honour with the Hitler salute; this was demolished in 1945 and the four police officers remembered with a plaque in the pavement and in 2010 with one on the wall of the Residenz.The Odeonsplatz was also the subject of at least one painting by Hitler.Together with the Marienplatz, the Odeonsplatz remains an important site for both civic events and demonstrations.ReferencesExternal linksOdeonsplatz City PanoramaOdeonsplatz during the Nazi era and todaySusanna Rieger, 'Der Münchner Odeonsplatz und seine Gebäude' (PDF)Odeonsplatz - videoMaxvorstadt Squares in Munich Tourist attractions in Munich", "machine_text": "Odeonsplatz is a public square located in Munich, Germany. The square was named after the Odeon concert hall, which was located on the site from 1828 until it was destroyed in 1944 during World War II. Today, the square is a popular tourist destination and a hub of cultural and political activity in the city. Surrounded by impressive Neoclassical buildings, Odeonsplatz is not only a historical landmark, but also an architectural masterpiece. The square is home to some of the most iconic buildings in Munich, such as the Theatine Church and the Bavarian State Chancellery. The Theatine Church is an impressive structure in the Italian Baroque style with a striking yellow façade that dominates the square. The Bavarian State Chancellery, on the other hand, is a grandiose Neo-Renaissance building that is home to the state government's offices. The square is a popular venue for outdoor events, especially during summer months, when the area is transformed into a vibrant hub of cultural activities. A variety of concerts, exhibitions, and markets are held in the square, and it is also a popular spot for street performers and musicians. Odeonsplatz is also a site of great historical importance. During the Nazi regime, the square was used for political rallies and speeches by Adolf Hitler and other high-ranking Nazi officials. Today, the square serves as a reminder of the city's complex history and the importance of vigilance in safeguarding democratic values. Overall, Odeonsplatz is an impressive intersection of art, architecture, and history. As a hub of cultural and political activity in Munich, it is a must-visit destination for anyone seeking to immerse themselves in the city's rich and diverse history.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 20849935}

Along with the religion came the role of the qazi - a judge who administers Islamic law. The qazi played a significant role in the development of the country and continue to be an essential aspect of Maldivian society. The following is a list of notable qazis of the Maldives: 1. Sheikh Salih Al-Maqsud: One of the earliest Qazis of the Maldives who arrived in the country in the 12th century. Al-Maqsud was instrumental in the early spread of Islam across the islands. 2. Sheikh Yusuf Shamsuddin: Another prominent qazi of the Maldives who worked in the country in the 14th century. He wrote many books and treatises on Islamic law which are still studied in the Maldives and other Muslim countries today. 3. Sheikh Ibrahim Huraa: A well-known qazi who served the Maldives in the 17th century. He held the position of qazi during the reign of Sultan Ibrahim Iskandar II, and is remembered for his wisdom and strict adherence to Islamic law. 4. Sheikh Ahmed Luthufi: One of the most famous qazis of the Maldives who worked in the 20th century. Luthufi was a prolific writer and scholar who is credited with modernizing the Maldivian legal system by incorporating Islamic law with modern legal practices. 5. Sheikh Mohamed Ibrahim Didi: Another renowned qazi who served in the Maldives in the 20th century. Didi was a key figure in the fight for Maldivian independence and was appointed as the first Chief Justice of the Maldives after the country gained independence from Britain in 1965. These are just a few examples of the many qazis who have served the Maldives throughout its history. The role of the qazi remains essential in the modern Maldives, with a number of qazis still holding positions in the country's judicial system. Their expertise in Islamic law continues to be a valuable asset for the country, helping to maintain its unique cultural identity and traditions.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 3818099}

It is characterized by its passionate and erotic scenes, often featuring graphic descriptions of sexual encounters and taboo subject matter. The origins of Red Hot Romance can be traced back to the early 20th century, when authors such as D.H. Lawrence and Anaïs Nin began writing explicit novels that explored themes of love and sexuality. These works challenged traditional notions of morality and relationships, and paved the way for the emergence of modern erotic literature. During the 1960s and 1970s, the genre gained popularity thanks to the rise of paperback publishing and the sexual revolution. Authors such as Jackie Collins and Judith Krantz became bestsellers, while films like 'Last Tango in Paris' and '9 1/2 Weeks' became box office hits. Today, Red Hot Romance remains a popular genre in literature and film. The advent of e-books and online publishing has made it easier for independent authors to write and distribute their work, while streaming platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime have made it possible for filmmakers to produce and distribute risqué content. Critics of Red Hot Romance argue that it promotes unhealthy attitudes towards sex and relationships, objectifies women, and perpetuates unrealistic expectations. Supporters argue that it empowers women to explore their own desires and challenges traditional gender roles. Regardless of its controversial nature, Red Hot Romance continues to captivate audiences with its steamy love stories and graphic scenes, making it a mainstay of popular culture.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 5566075}

The series featured pairs of celebrity contestants, who lived together in a house under constant surveillance while their every move was televised to the audience. Just like the original Gran Hermano, the show follows the format of Big Brother, whereby contestants with different backgrounds, personalities and views are chosen to live together for a period of time with no access to the outside world. They are filmed 24/7 and are required to perform tasks, nominate their fellow housemates for eviction and face public votes. The pair with the lowest number of votes would be evicted from the house. One of the key differences between Gran Hermano Dúo and the original Gran Hermano is that contestants are paired together, either as a couple, friends, relatives or colleagues, to compete as a team. The pair is required to vote together and eventually face eviction together.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Lucy and Ricky Ricardo\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Lucy and Ricky Ricardo, also known simply as Lucy and Ricky or the Ricardos, are fictional characters from the American television sitcom I Love Lucy, portrayed respectively by Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. The Ricardos also appear in The Lucy–Desi Comedy Hour, and Lucy also appears in one episode of The Ann Sothern Show.Together, Lucy and Ricky serve as a double act. Ricky is the straight man, a character very similar to Arnaz himself; he is a Cuban-American bandleader whose trademark song is 'Babalu'. Red-haired Lucy is his wife, who always gets into trouble and is usually caught at it by Ricky. Their son, Ricky Ricardo Jr. (usually called 'Little Ricky'), was born in the middle of the show's second season. He was portrayed by child actor Richard Keith beginning in season 6.Lucy's full name (Lucille Esmeralda RicardoMcGillicuddy) is given in the Season 1 episodes 'Fred and Ethel Fight' and 'The Marriage License,' and 'The Passports' in Season 5. Ricky gives his full name in the Season 4 episode 'Hollywood Anniversary' as Ricardo Alberto Fernando Ricardo y de Acha, but in the Season 6 episode 'Lucy Raises Tulips' Lucy calls him 'Enrique Alberto Fernando Ricardo y de Acha III'.Fictional character biographiesEarly livesMuch like Lucille Ball herself, Lucy McGillicuddy was born and raised in Jamestown, New York (or West Jamestown as revealed in Season 5), to an American family of Scottish descent. In one episode in which she is asked her birthday, she gives it as August 6 (the same as Ball's), though in typical fashion, she refuses to give the year; in another, where she is forced to tell the truth, she says she is 33 years old. This episode aired during the third season in 1953. This makes her born in the year 1920.In the episode, her parents are never referred to by name, and only her mother (portrayed by Kathryn Card) is seen over the course of the series. No other family is even mentioned, except for a passing reference to her grandmother being Swedish (Jamestown has a large Swedish community). In the season 5 episode 'The Passports', it is established she was born in 1921, therefore is exactly 10 years younger than Ball in real life.In grammar school, she played a petunia in a recital. In high school, she was involved in the drama program, wherein she studied with Miss Hanna and played Juliet Capulet in Romeo and Juliet. She also played the saxophone in high school (as did the real Lucy), though every song she played sounded like 'The Glow-Worm'. Lucy also knows how to play the ukulele. She is seen playing a ukulele in episodes 'Ricky Loses His Voice', 'Don Juan is Shelved', and 'Little Ricky Gets Stage Fright'.A reference to Lucille's attendance at an unnamed junior college is made in the episode 'Fan Magazine Interview' (1954); Jamestown Community College, the nearest junior college to Lucy's hometown, did not exist until 1950, although a business college and nursing school did exist in the city at the time.MarriageWhen she was 22, Lucy was set up on a blind date by her friend Marion Strong. Her blind date turned out to be a Cuban conga drummer, Ricky Ricardo. The two fell in love and eventually got married at the Byram River Beagle Club in Connecticut. An alternate scenario given to guest star Hedda Hopper in the Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour episode 'Lucy Takes a Cruise to Havana,' with Lucy and friend Susie McNamara (Ann Sothern, reprising her role from Private Secretary), is that Lucy met Ricky while vacationing in Cuba in 1940.In the early 1940s, Lucy and Ricky moved into an old reconverted brownstone apartment at 623 East 68th Street in New York City (references made during the series date the move to 1940 or 1943). In reality, this address does not exist (the last numbered building on E 68th Street is 590, so this address would be in the East River). The apartment rented for 105 per month. Their landlords (soon to be best friends) were Fred and Ethel Mertz. Lucy and Ethel quickly became best friends, even though Ethel is older than Lucy. Upon moving to the city, Ricky ends up getting a job headlining the Tropicana where he and his band are held over indefinitely.To Lucy, Ricky's career and days seem so much more exciting than her days of cooking and cleaning. She desperately wants to be a star and constantly tries to get into Ricky's act. Ricky wants his wife to remain a homemaker. However, in spite of Ricky's reluctance and regular refusal to give her a role, Lucy sometimes finds a way into the show.Birth of Little RickyIn 1952, after going to the doctor complaining of feeling 'dauncey' (a word her grandmother made up; Lucy's definition of feeling 'dauncey' is when you are not really sick but just feel lousy) and gaining weight, she learns that she is pregnant. It is actually Ethel who first suggests to Lucy she may be expecting, even before Lucy heads out to the doctor. Lucy is very excited to tell her husband the news.The Mertzes learn the news first and are sworn to secrecy. When she was younger, Lucy had envisioned how she would tell her husband they were going to have a baby. She decides to tell Ricky when he comes home for lunch that afternoon. However, with repeated interruptions from the telephone and the Mertzes, she is unable. She tries to tell him down at his club during rehearsals, but is uncomfortable telling him such a personal thing in front of his band, so she runs out crying.Finally, that evening, while Ricky is performing, Lucy pens a note and passes it to the maître d'hotel. He gives the note to Ricky. Ricky reads the note, which alludes to a wife needing to tell her husband they are having a baby, and requests that he sing a particular song. Ricky, unaware that the 'husband' mentioned in the note is himself, wants to bring the expectant couple up on stage to congratulate them. He goes from couple to couple trying to find them. Ricky notices Lucy in the audience, and it occurs to him that Lucy may be the one who is expecting. Lucy nods yes, and Ricky is overcome with emotion. They sing 'We're Having a Baby', with Lucille Ball actually breaking down in tears during the scene.During her pregnancy, Lucy experiences the normal pregnancy woes. She becomes depressed when everyone seems to focus their attention on the impending child and not on Lucy. She cannot decide on a name for the child and is nervous that she will not be a good mother. However, she wants the best for her child and enrolls herself, Ricky, and the Mertzes in elocution lessons to make sure her child learns how to speak properly. Finally, she takes up sculpting so she and Ricky can enrich their child's life with art and music. However, Lucy's show business aspirations never wane. She manages to break into Ricky's barbershop quartet number by firing the man who has the part she wants.Finally, on January 19, 1953 — the same day she had her real-life son Desi Arnaz Jr. (technically IV) — while husband Ricky is performing a voodoo act at his nightclub, Lucy gives birth to Ricky Ricardo Jr. The Mertzes are named Little Ricky's godparents. Little Ricky grows on a season-by-season basis, and by the sixth season (1957), he has started school and learned to play the drums and speak Spanish.HollywoodIn 1954, Ricky is given a role in an upcoming MGM film based on the life of Don Juan. Lucy and the Mertzes follow Ricky on his journey to Hollywood stardom. While in Hollywood, Lucy meets many famous celebrities, including William Holden, Hedda Hopper, Rock Hudson, Cornel Wilde, Harpo Marx, Richard Widmark, Van Johnson and John Wayne. Some of these actors are celebrities that Ricky has already met as a result of his work.She reports having spotted 99 celebrities while in Hollywood and finally procures an even 100 when she meets Wilde. Lucy is incredibly starstruck and saves anything that had come in contact with a celebrity, such as a can smashed by Cary Grant's left rear wheel. However, she does not just hobnob with celebrities; she also gets a few chances to break into show business herself.Ricky gets her a small role in a film as a showgirl. Lucy's role requires her to wear a large headdress; she also gets a death scene. However, the headdress proves cumbersome, and her part is downgraded. She eventually ends up as a showgirl who is already dead on a stretcher when the scene begins. Lucy's second foray into show business is when she replaces Van Johnson's sick redheaded partner in his act at the hotel. She wants to impress her friend Carolyn Appleby and successfully coaxes Johnson give her the job through flattery.Finally, she has her third shot at stardom when she appears with a Ricky Ricardo dummy at a luncheon for movie executives. Ricky was asked to perform, but he declined in favor of a fishing trip he had planned. Lucy accepted on his behalf and schemed to build a dummy of Ricky and then pretend that he is ill, and she finishes the show herself. Her plan does not go as well as she had hoped, but she is still a success, as the executives think the performance is meant to be a comedy act, and she is offered a contract. However, she declines when she realizes that it would take her away from her husband, son and friends.EuropeVery soon after returning home from Hollywood, Ricky's band is given a chance to tour around Europe. Fred is recruited as Ricky's band manager and Lucy and Ethel tag along. Lucy misses the boat and has to be lowered to the deck of the cruise ship, the USS Constitution, from a helicopter. They sail across the Atlantic, where Lucy has to settle for being partnered with a young boy to play games on deck but together they win a ping pong trophy. She also manages to get stuck in a porthole.After landing in England, Lucy gets the chance to perform for and meet Queen Elizabeth. She also participates in a fox hunt and gets to stay at an English estate.In Paris, she meets Charles Boyer who has been warned by Ricky not to admit who he is because Lucy is so star-struck; Boyer takes his advice when Lucy corners him and claims he is Maurice DuBois, an out-of-work actor. Ricky has feigned jealousy about Lucy's obsession with Charles Boyer so she hires 'DuBois' to impersonate Boyer and pitch woo to her in front of Ricky so she can reassure him with her total lack of interest. She coaches 'DuBois' on Boyer's 'growl' and mannerisms, remaining unaware that he is the real Boyer until Ethel calls her and reveals Ricky and Boyer's trick.In another episode, Lucy is arrested by French police after inadvertently using counterfeit money. The scene that ensues, after Ricky arrives to bail her out, involves the only-French-speaking Commandante interrogating Lucy by directing questions to his French-and-German-speaking Lieutenant in French, who translates the questions into German and directs them to a drunken German-and-Spanish-speaking prisoner, who translates the questions into Spanish to ask Spanish-and-English-speaking Ricky, who makes the final translation into English for Lucy. Her answers must travel back up the chain to the Commandante.Also, she stomps on grapes in Turo, a winemaking town in Italy, and wrestles her professional grape-stomping partner in a grape vat.Moving to ConnecticutIn 1956, Lucy and Ricky decide to move to Connecticut after making a trip there, and Lucy falls in love with the area. Before they move in, though, she tries unsuccessfully to get out of the deal. Soon the Ricardos decide to raise chickens and sell the eggs. To help them with their business, their best friends, Fred Mertz and Ethel Mertz, move into their guest house, as Fred was raised on a farm. Lucy and Ricky also make close friends while in Connecticut, Betty and Ralph Ramsey (the Ricardos' next door neighbors).After I Love Lucy I Love Lucy and The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour concluded in the aftermath of Arnaz and Ball's real-life divorce in 1960, an incident that was not written into the script. The characters remained married to each other at the end of the series' run.Lucille Ball would go on to perform Lucy Ricardo-inspired characters on her ensuing sitcoms: The Lucy Show, Here's Lucy, and the short-lived Life with Lucy. In each series, the character Ball portrayed (each one named Lucy) was a widow or divorceé. In the mid-1960s, she was involved in a lawsuit against Jess Oppenheimer, the co-creator of I Love Lucy, over the similarities among the separate Lucy characters. The dispute was later settled out of court.Arnaz only portrayed a similar Ricky Ricardo character once after The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour ended its run: in a recurring role on The Mothers-in-Law, Arnaz portrayed matador Raphael Delgado, with the same accent and personality as Ricky (as a Desilu production, The Mothers-in-Law used many of the same writers and executive staff as the Lucy shows).Other television series, especially those created by Desilu (the production company Arnaz and Ball co-founded) sought to copy the Lucy Ricardo theme. Even Janis Paige, in her short-lived Desilu produced CBS sitcom It's Always Jan, wore her hair like Lucy's, and Cara Williams followed the Lucy Ricardo format in Pete and Gladys, which lasted only two seasons on CBS.ReferencesI Love Lucy characters Fictional characters from New York (state) Television characters introduced in 1951 Fictional families Fictional married couples Television duos Intercultural and interracial relationships", "machine_text": "Lucy and Ricky Ricardo, played by Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz respectively, were the iconic couple of the 1950s television series 'I Love Lucy'. This popular sitcom aired from 1951 to 1957 and followed the ups and downs of the Ricardos, a Cuban-American husband and wife who lived in New York City and owned a nightclub. Lucy Ricardo was a zany, red-headed homemaker who dreamed of becoming a star in show business. She was always getting into trouble and coming up with crazy schemes to achieve her goals, much to the chagrin of her husband, Ricky Ricardo. Desi Arnaz, a Cuban-American musician, played Ricky, a nightclub owner and bandleader who spoke with a thick accent and was frequently frustrated by Lucy's antics. One of the most memorable aspects of 'I Love Lucy' was the show's use of live audiences. This gave the show a unique energy and allowed for instant feedback from viewers. The show also pioneered the use of multiple cameras and filmed on a soundstage instead of on location, allowing for more control and flexibility in filming. 'I Love Lucy' was groundbreaking not only in its comedic style but also in its portrayal of an interracial marriage. The show was controversial at the time for its portrayal of a white woman married to a Latino man, but it ultimately broke down barriers and became a beloved classic. After 'I Love Lucy' ended, Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz continued to work together on other projects, but their marriage eventually ended in divorce. However, their legacy as one of television's most beloved couples endures to this day, with 'I Love Lucy' continuing to influence and entertain audiences decades after its initial run.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 11167343}

Physical and social infrastructure would be provided to support the settler and satellite population, expected to reach a total of 65,000 persons by 1985.

The project covers an estimated area of 42,000 hectares in Bura, Hola and Galole districts and was designed to provide sufficient irrigation water to support crop farming, livestock rearing and settlement of people living in these drought-prone regions. The project involved extensive irrigation, land reclamation and a resettlement program. The irrigation scheme was designed to draw water from River Tana, one of the largest rivers in Kenya, for irrigation of crops such as rice, maize, vegetables, fruits, and horticultural crops. The reclaimed land was earmarked for grazing purposes to support livestock rearing, a traditional livelihood in the region. Additionally, the settlement program saw the resettlement of over 20,000 people who were previously living as nomads in the area. They were resettled in organized settlements near the irrigation schemes to increase their access to food and other basic amenities such as education and health care. The Bura Irrigation and Settlement Project has not been without challenges. The project was initiated during a period of political instability and partial funding by international organizations such as the World Bank, which were eventually withdrawn. This led to some setbacks in the project’s implementation, but the project stayed afloat thanks to the support of Kenyan governments through the decades. Despite challenges and setbacks, the project has made significant strides in increasing agricultural productivity for the semi-arid regions of Kenya. It has been able to provide food for the populace and increased the job market for people living in the area. The resettlement program has also been a success in providing basic needs and infrastructure for the people who previously led nomadic lifestyles. Although further investments are required to sustain the irrigation and land reclamation activities, the project's establishment has significantly contributed to Kenyan agricultural productivity.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 51875617}

Running back Allen Pinkett was the team's leading rusher, accumulating 734 yards and six touchdowns on the ground. The Irish offense struggled at times, however, and failed to score more than 14 points in six of their eleven games. On defense, Notre Dame was stout against the run but had difficulty defending the pass. The Irish allowed just 107.3 rushing yards per game but gave up an average of 223.3 passing yards per game. Standout defensive end Ross Browner, who had 78 tackles and 10 sacks on the season, anchored the Irish defensive front.

During the past months, Fuka had started training several women, including Arisa Hoshiki, Eri Susa, Yoko Bito and most notably Yuzuki Aikawa, to become professional wrestlers for Stardom and also recruited her friend, mixed martial artist Mika Nagano, as part of the promotion's roster. Fuka works as the on-screen authority figure and ring announcer for Stardom and starts each major event with a dance performance. On January 21, 2018, at Stardom's 7th Anniversary show, Fuka announced her retirement from Stardom, as she was expecting her first child in the summer.Mixed martial arts and shoot boxing While signed to JDStar as a professional wrestler, Kakimoto also began looking for opportunities to transition into mixed martial arts (MMA) with the Smackgirl promotion.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Ra-Ra Zoo\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Ra-Ra Zoo was an English-based new circus theatre company, active (August 1984 - September 1994), a seminal group who created self devised physical theatre performance for theatres using comedy and circus skills. Founded by Sue Broadway, Stephen Kent, David Spathaky and Sue Bradley while they were all working and staying together at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in August 1984.In 2018, the UK Guardian newspaper named them as one of the 25 most influential aspects of the 250 year history of circus in the West.The first public performance was at the infamous Tunnel Club hosted by Malcolm Hardee in the East End of London. Notably, the normally vocal audience were unusually silenced by a wordless version of their signature teacup act.Their first full show at the Battersea Arts Centre was as part of the London International Mime Festival in January 1985, their first theatre show, sub-titled, 'Juggling With A Social Conscience'.They subsequently toured internationally for ten years playing in theatres notable to Africa, South America, Australia and extensively in Europe. Their show under the joint Artistic Direction of David Spathaky and Sue Broadway combined the ethos of 'alternative' comedy of the 1980 with a 1970s revival of circus skills, variously called 'Neo-circus or new variety by them or New Circus' by other people, it largely promoted a reinvention of circus focusing on human skill and generally without presenting animal acts. Their background in street performing, The Amazing Mendezies and in the influential Circus Oz (of which Sue Broadway was a founding member) gave the show an irreverent, fast-paced, surrealist feel.ProductionsThey produced several different shows and were occasionally given some financial support in the UK by the Arts Council and other grants. They also produced several large scale community shows, were touring two shows at the same time in the early 1990s and created jobs for more than twenty five people simultaneously during production periods.They notably adhered to a political commitment of a balance of men and women on stage and off and of equal pay for all company members throughout their existence.Shows included:Juggling With A Social Conscience. My Life on a Plate of Toast — Several versions - chamber circus 4 people on stage Domestic Bliss - a touring seven person theatre circus show Stop Laughing This Is Serious - touring 7 person theatre circus show Fabulous Beasts - touring seven person theatre circus show Gravity Swing- touring seven person theatre circus show Angels and Amazons - all woman 3 person clown show Swan - a community circus White Snake - A large scale community circus opera (50 performers) combining professional and non professional performers, trainers from China, original libretto and commissioned music. Cabinet of Curiosities - A 'chamber circus' - 4 people on stage Broadway Belles - All women cabaret show The Mast - a site specific outdoor aerial rig at the Albany Empire in Deptford and the Henley Regatta. The Plymouth Theatre Royal Cleaners - a commissioned intervention at a patrons end of season party.InfluenceRa-Ra Zoo was influenced by the agitprop and political theatre of the late 1960s and early 70's and the ritual theatre and 'Happenings' associated with the time notably the 'Grand Magic Circus', 'Circus Oz, 'The People Show', 'Cunning Stunts, 'The Festival of Fools' in Amsterdam and the German choreographer Pina Bausch. Political influence came from the 1970s wave of the feminist movement and direct action politics such as the protests at Greenham Common in the UK and the resurgence of 'theatre' as political activism.Ra-Ra Zoo influenced in turn many others as the company employed over a hundred people during its existence and played to many thousands of people worldwide. They spawned and encouraged, directly and indirectly, many offshoots including The Circus Space, (now NCCA) The Gandini Juggling Project, The Flying Gorillas, No Ordinary Angels, Le La Les, Broadway and Co., and Stretch People.Founder Sue Broadwayreturned to lead Circus Ozas Artistic Director and helped direct the circus elements of the Sydney Olympics opening ceremony.Founder Dave Spathaky was in semi retirement from 1994 but after surgery in 2008 is producing and occasionally performing as The Great Davido.

They also featured on a broadcast pilot for C4 with Spike Milligan 'The Last Laugh before TVAM'. Dave Spathaky and Sue Broadway appeared together on TV shows worldwide, several times successfully beating their own world plate-spinning record.Early Days In early days they played on the emerging 'New Variety' and alternative cabaret circuit and were the very first performers on stage at the newly reopened Hackney Empire in East London on 9 December 1986. They subsequently played several successful seasons there with their full-length shows.World Touring Their extensive touring was sometimes partly funded by the British Council but also self-produced. They represented the UK at World Expos in Vancouver, Canada, in 1986 and in Brisbane, Australia, in 1988.Death or Resurrection?Ra-Ra Zoo's last full show to date 'Cabinet of Curiosities' toured in 1993/4 and like their first full show (in 1995) was in the London International Mime Festival (in 1994), the last show of that tour was at the Liverpool Everyman also in 1994.Reprise In 2011 founders Dave Spathaky, Sue Broadway (with musician Thom Podgoretsky) performed at The Cork Midsummer Festival and the Glastonbury Festival but have currently no plans for new Ra-Ra Zoo productions in the pipelines but an online project in 2020called 'Clown Power Live' at:  during the anthropause, contain collaborative elements between Sue BroadwayDave Spathaky.ReferencesTheatre companies in England Edinburgh Festival performers", "machine_text": "Ra-Ra Zoo is an animal-themed attraction located in the heart of the city of Abidjan, Ivory Coast.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"George W. M. Reynolds\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "George William MacArthur Reynolds (23 July 1814 – 19 June 1879) was a British fiction writer and journalist.Reynolds was born in Sandwich, Kent, the son of Captain Sir George Reynolds, a flag officer of the Royal Navy. Reynolds was educated first at Dr. Nance's school in Ashford, Kent, and then attended the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He was intended for a career in the British Army, but his parents died during 1829 and, with his subsequent inheritance, he decided to quit the military and devote himself instead to literary pursuits. He left Sandhurst on 13 September 1830 and for the next few years he traveled a great deal, particularly in France, and became a naturalised French citizen. He began residence in Paris in 1834, where he started a daily English newspaper. The venture failed, and Reynolds returned bankrupt to England in 1836.Reynolds served as editor of The Teetotaler (a weekly journal advocating teetotalism) beginning in 1840.Writing Reynolds was a prolific writer of popular fiction starting from The Youthful Imposter, published in 1835 which was then republished later as The Parricide; or, The Youth's Career of Crime. After the publication of his first novel Reynolds then assumed the editorship of The Monthly Magazine, a position which he held between 1837 and 1838 and wrote articles under the pseudonym of 'Parisianus.' Almost forgotten now, during his lifetime he was more read than Dickens or Thackeray; in his obituary, the trade magazine The Bookseller called Reynolds 'the most popular writer of our times' ('Obituary' 600). His best-known work was the long-running serial The Mysteries of London (1844), which borrowed liberally in concept from Eugène Sue's Les Mystères de Paris (The Mysteries of Paris). It sold 40,000 copies a week in penny instalments and more than a million copies cumulatively before it was issued in bound volumes, enjoying an international circulation in French, German, Italian, and Spanish translations. Although it was outlawed by the authorities, the German version achieved the status of a cult favourite on the Russian black market.The Mysteries of London and its even lengthier sequel, The Mysteries of the Court of London, are considered to be among the seminal works of the Victorian 'urban mysteries' genre, a style of sensational fiction which adapted elements of Gothic novels – with their haunted castles, innocent noble damsels in distress and nefarious villains – to produce stories which instead emphasized the poverty, crime, and violence of a great metropolis, complete with detailed and often sympathetic descriptions of the lives of lower-class lawbreakers and extensive glossaries of thieves' cant, all interwoven with a frank sexuality not usually found in popular fiction of the time.The Mysteries of London, like most of Reynolds' works, was published first as a weekly penny dreadful, or 'Penny Blood', illustrated with lurid engravings and circulating mainly among readers of limited means and education. Although Reynolds was unusual in his religious skepticism (one of the main characters in The Mysteries of London was a clergyman turned libertine) and political radicalism, his tales were intended for his mostly middle- and lower-class readers; they featured 'hump-backed dwarves, harridans and grave-robbers [who] groped past against a background of workhouses, jails, execution yards, thieves' kitchens and cemeteries. His readers could depend on him to bring in the theme of maiden virtue rudely strumpeted as often as possible.'Reynolds' Wagner, the Wehr-Wolf was a gothic novel which described how the title character became a werewolf after making a pact with the devil. Wagner, the Wehr-Wolf was republished in 1975 by Dover Books with an introduction and bibliography of Reynolds by E. F. Bleiler.Reynold's novels remained in print on both sides of the Atlantic longer than those of many of his contemporaries. An 1875 edition of Reynolds's Ciprina, published in Philadelphia, lists 40 novels including Mysteries of London under the heading 'George W. M. Reynolds' Great Works', priced between 50 cents and 1.00. The Mysteries of the Court of London, translated into Marathi as well as Urdu, remained a best-seller in India well into the twentieth century. The Marathi translation was done by K.B. Mande in the early 20th century and was titled The Secret Deeds of the Elites of London. It was very popular in the Marathi-speaking area, as is evident by numerous references to the text in early 20th-century Marathi literature.Chartism Reynolds was also a major figure in the Chartist movement. In 1846, he founded two magazines, Reynolds' Miscellany (RM) and The London Journal (LJ). In 1849, he founded Reynolds's Political Instructor, which in May 1850 became Reynolds Weekly Newspaper, the leading radical newspaper of the post-Chartist era. It long survived him, ending publication in 1967 as the Sunday Citizen. Edwin Brett, a fellow chartist and publisher of penny dreadfuls, became a lifelong friend.For both Reynolds's Political Instructor and Reynolds's Weekly Newspaper, between 1849 and 1856, he would write a signed editorial every week in which he gave his opinion on the pressing political matters of the day.In 1854, he relocated to Herne Bay in Kent, where he became one of the town's Improvement Commissioners. Reynolds was an advocate of British Republicanism; much of his journalism, especially during the 1870s, 'promoted a levelling agenda against traditional social hierarchies and accentuated the difficulties of the British throne'.WorksNovels A prolific novelist, the list of Reynolds's works is long; matters are made more complex by the fact that American publishers often attributed the authorship of various anonymously written books to Reynolds as well. Furthermore, although he is known as a penny blood author, not all of his works appeared as serialised penny instalments.The following works have, as a result of research by E. F. Bleiler, been confirmed to have been definitely authored by Reynolds:The Youthful Imposter(published in 3 vols by Librarie des Estrangers in 1835)The Baroness: A Novel(serialised in the Monthly Magazine in 1837, under the pseudonym of 'Parisianus')Pickwick Abroad; or, The Tour in France(serialised in the Monthly Magazine between 1837 and 1838)Alfred de Rosann(serialised in the Monthly Magazine in 1838).The Father(serialised in the Monthly Magazine in 1838).Mary Hamel(serialised in the Monthly Magazine in 1838).The Appointment: A Tale(serialised in The Isis in 1839).Grace Darling; or, the Heroine of the Ferne Islands(published in one volume by George Henderson in 1839).Robert Macaire in England(published in 3 vols by Thomas Tegg in 1839).Noctes Pickwickianae(serialised in The Teetotaller in 1840).The Steam Packet: A Tale of the River and Ocean(published in one volume by Willoughby in 1840).The Drunkard's Tale(serialised in The Teetotaller in 1840).Pickwick Married(serialised in The Teetotaller in 1841).Master Timothy's Bookcase(issued in weekly parts beginning 15 July 1841 and published as a single volume by W.

M. Reynolds (? – 1879) was a British author and journalist, best known for his historical novels, which were extremely popular throughout the 19th century. Reynolds worked as a writer and journalist for various newspapers and magazines, including the Fiction Factory, the London Journal, and Reynolds's Weekly Newspaper, which he founded in 1850 and edited until his death. Reynolds's most famous work is his epic novel, 'The Mysteries of London,' which was first published in serial form from 1844 to 1846. The novel tells the story of the criminal underworld of London, and is notable for its sensational plot twists and vivid descriptions of life in Victorian London. 'The Mysteries of London' was an immediate success, and was reprinted and adapted numerous times in Reynolds's lifetime. It has been called 'the most popular novel of the Victorian era.' In addition to his literary work, Reynolds was a political activist and a champion of social justice. He was a leading figure in the Chartist movement, which sought to extend voting rights and political power to the working class. Reynolds's novels often include social and political commentary, and he was known for his advocacy of the rights of the poor and the oppressed. Reynolds died in 1879, but his legacy as a writer and a social activist continues to be celebrated today. His novels remain popular among readers of historical fiction, and his commitment to social justice has inspired generations of activists and reformers.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 4485501}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Petition to the King\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Petition to the King was a petition sent to King George III by the First Continental Congress in 1774, calling for repeal of the Intolerable Acts.Political background Following the end of the French and Indian War (the North American theater of the Seven Years' War) in 1763, relations between the colonies and Britain had been deteriorating. Because the war had plunged the British government deep into debt, Parliament enacted a series of measures to increase tax revenue from the colonies. These acts, such as the Stamp Act of 1765 and the Townshend Acts of 1767, were seen as legitimate means of collecting revenues to pay off the nearly two-fold increase in British debt stemming from the war.Many colonists in the Americas, however, developed a different conception of their role within the British Empire. In particular, because the colonies were not directly represented in Parliament, colonists argued that Parliament had no right to levy taxes upon them. After colonists destroyed thousands of pounds of British-taxed tea during the Boston Tea Party, Parliament passed the Coercive Acts in 1774, punishing the colonies for their actions. These punitive Acts were vehemently opposed by the colonists, leading the newly formed Continental Congress to seek redress with King George III, in an attempt to reach a common understanding.Development of the documentConceptionOn October 1, 1774, in response to the deteriorating relationship between the American Colonies and Britain, the First Continental Congress decided to prepare a statement to King George III of Great Britain. The goal of the address was to persuade the King to revoke unpopular policies such as the Coercive Acts, which were imposed on the Colonies by the British Parliament. The committee appointed to prepare the Address consisted of Richard Henry Lee, John Adams, Thomas Johnson, Patrick Henry, and John Rutledge, with Lee designated as the committee chairman.On October 5, 1774, Congress once more returned to the subject of the Address, stressing to the committee that the document should assure the King that following the successful repeal of the Coercive Acts, the Colonies would restore favorable relations with Britain.Approval by CongressOn October 25, 1774, the petition came before Congress in its draft form. After the document was debated over and formally amended, it was then approved to be engrossed and sent to England to be presented to the King.Annotated text of the petition The petition, when written, was not divided into formal parts. However, the structure of the document allows it to be classified into sections, including an introduction, the list of grievances, reasons for attention, and a conclusion.Delivery of the document On November 2, the petition departed Philadelphia on board the ship Britannia, captained by W. Morwick. However, a storm forced the ship to return to port, delaying the delivery of the petition. It was later discovered that the paper was unfit to be presented. The second copy left port on November 6 on board the ship Mary and Elizabeth, captained by N. Falconer. It was confirmed on November 14 that the document successfully arrived in London.In Britain, a number of London merchants expressed interest in joining the Americans when the petition was presented, although Benjamin Franklin advised against the proposition. On December 21, Benjamin Franklin, Lee, and Bollan were notified by Lord Dartmouth that the petition was 'decent and respectful' and that it would be presented as soon as possible to the Houses of Parliament. However, Franklin wrote two days later that the petition could not be presented to Parliament until after the Christmas recess.Response On January 19, 1775, the petition was presented to the House of Commons by Lord North, and was also presented to the House of Lords the following day.Because the petition was intermingled with many other documents, and given the increasing turmoil of the times, little attention was given to the petition by Parliament. Likewise, the King never gave the Colonies a formal reply to their petition.Publication When the official papers of Congress were published in October and November 1774, the Petition to the King was omitted, because it was preferred that the address be read by the King before being made public. It was not until January 17 or 18, 1775 that the papers were officially released by Charles Thomson, for publication.Surviving drafts Three drafts of the Petition to the King survive to this day: one written by Patrick Henry, one written by Richard Henry Lee, and one by John Dickinson.Patrick Henry The Henry draft is written with very few corrections on its four portfolio pages. Compared to the final version of the Address, the draft contains more rhetorical descriptions of the contested Acts, and focuses less on the Colonies' past loyalty to Britain.Richard Henry Lee The Lee draft is neatly written, with minor changes, on three portfolio pages. Compared to the Henry draft, the descriptions of the grievances were brief. It does contain, however, a harsh attack on the King's ministers, most notably Bute, Mansfield, and North. Because of the inflammatory language in this draft, it is argued that this is the version that was rejected by Congress on October 21, 1774.John Dickinson The Dickinson draft is a rough composition, rite with many changes, including entire paragraphs designated to be transposed. The document is nine and a half portfolio pages, numbered 1-9 and 12, with pages 10 and 11 left blank. The text found in this draft is virtually identical to the document adopted by Congress, with the main difference lying in the list of grievances in the adopted version, which resembled those found in the other two drafts.Historical significance The Petition to the King reflected the Colonies' desire to maintain relations with Britain, given that certain demands were met. In particular, it showed that the Colonies viewed themselves as loyal to the British monarchy rather than to Parliament.See alsoFounding Fathers of the United StatesNotesReferences1774 in the Thirteen Colonies Ordinances of the Continental Congress Documents of the American Revolution Petitions 1774 in international relations George III of the United Kingdom 1774 documents", "machine_text": "Petition to the King is a formal request made through a written document addressed to a monarch or sovereign, seeking the redressal of grievances or the granting of a specific envoy. Petitions to the king played an essential role in the governance of monarchies throughout history, especially when the ruler exercised intense power over the state. In the British Royal court, the Petition to the King was believed to be one of the three traditional ways in which the king made laws. The practice of presenting a formal request to the monarch dates back to the Magna Carta, and over time, it became an established process of governmental consultation between the king and his subjects. In the medieval period, Petitions to the King were primarily used by the landed gentry, merchants, and guilds to protect/reinforce their rights and properties from arbitrary laws and confiscation by the monarch. As the power of the monarch gradually reduced, the availability of other alternatives for airing grievances reduced the frequency of petitions. During the Stuart period, especially under James I and Charles I, petitions to the king became increasingly political in nature, calling for the maintenance of liberties and constitutional rights. The use of Petitions to the King became an important tool of opposition to the ruling monarchs in the seventeenth century. In the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, the use of Petitions to the King declined massively as more parliamentary alternatives replaced it. The Petition of Right (1628) and the Bill of Rights (1689) were significant factors that shifted the centre of power from king to parliament. However, the right of subjects to petition the monarch remains in place in Britain to date. In conclusion, while Petitions to the King were initially crucial in preserving the rights of the subjects, many of the rights that people once petitioned for aren't necessarily relevant today. Nonetheless, the right of British subjects to petition Her Majesty the Queen stands as a vital part of the country's constitutional practice.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 17243383}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Nevadaplano\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Nevadaplano was a high plateau that covered parts of southwestern North America during the late Mesozoic and early Cenozoic, located in the present-day US states of Idaho, Nevada, Utah and possibly others. It most likely formed during the Cretaceous as a consequence of subduction dynamics and may have reached elevations ofand more. It was flanked on the west by the Sierra Nevada, which was traversed by various valleys that came down from the Nevadaplano. Closed basins and numerous volcanic calderas covered the relatively flat Nevadaplano; large volcanic eruptions distributed ignimbrites over the plateau and down the valleys draining it.During the Miocene, changes in the tectonic regime caused a collapse and dismemberment of the Nevadaplano. Tectonic extension gave rise to the Basin and Range province and separated the Sierra Nevada-Great Valley block from the Nevadaplano, forming today's landscape.Research historyThe existence of the Nevadaplano was proposed in 2004 by DeCelles and named after the Altiplano high plateau of South America. It is also known as the 'Great Basin Altiplano'. Unlike the present-day Andean Altiplano and Tibetan plateau, the Nevadaplano was dismembered during the Cenozoic and thus its structure and evolution are poorly understood.Geologic historyThe Nevadaplano probably formed as part of either the Sevier or the Laramide Orogeny during the Mesozoic and persisted into the Paleogene. Its growth began either in the Cretaceous or the Jurassic, when significant tectonic shortening took place behind the Sevier orogen. Similar to the present-day Altiplano in South America, the combination of an arid climate, tectonic contraction, weak erosion and the accumulation of volcanic rocks both in and below the crust helped raise the Nevadaplano during the Cretaceous, when flat subduction was taking place. Later its southern part was probably overprinted by the Laramide Orogeny when volcanism shifted far to the east. The exact geologic evolution of the Nevadaplano is controversial, however.The Nevadaplano underwent extensional tectonics during the Cenozoic in a multi-step process. One stage occurred in the Eocene-Oligocene towards the end of subduction, when subduction steepened again and slab rollback decreased the tectonic forces. It is possible that at that time volcanic activity swept southwestward, away from the volcanoes of central Nevada to the Sierra. This was accompanied by uplift that may have peaked at the arrival of the Yellowstone hotspot.The plateau overrode the heat source of the East Pacific Rise about 28 million years ago. After a delay, east–west extension and northwestward shearing set in with major extension underway by 16-17 million years ago. The heat flow from the Yellowstone hotspot facilitated the collapse process. Only during the Miocene did the surface of the high plateau to significantly lose elevation. During the Miocene the Sierra Nevada-Great Valley block separated from the Nevadaplano and was tilted to the west along the Sierra Escarpment, beheading a number of westward-going drainages in the process. Former drainages of the Nevadaplano were buried by volcanic rocks and disrupted by tectonic processes. Farther east, the dismemberment of the drainages may have created suitable environments for the evolution of sucker fish. Another stage in the Neogene is the well-known Basin and Range extension, triggered by changes in the plate boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate. Presently, relic surfaces around the Middle Fork Feather River valley and the high elevations of the northern Basin and Range may be considered remnants of the Nevadaplano.The Nevadaplano during its existenceThe Nevadaplano was located in present-day Nevada and Utah, at the location of the present-day Great Basin, and may have extended from what is present-day central Idaho in the north either to Sonora or southern Nevada in the south. It was a high plateau consisting of a peneplain and reached a width of . Isotope analysis indicates that the Nevadaplano stood at high elevations, probably higher than or comparable to the then-Sierra Nevada. The elevation of the Nevadaplano exceeded , but the exact value is controversial. It was not entirely flat, and there is evidence of basins at its western margin although the relief of the Nevadaplano was probably smaller than that of the Altiplano.The eastern Nevadaplano probably drained to internal basins such as the Uinta Basin, the Western Interior Seaway and westward to the Pacific Ocean. A drainage divide extended from the Mogollon Highlands in the south through the Kingman Uplift into the Nevadaplano. There is some uncertainty in the drainage directions across the Nevadaplano, with some evidence interpreted as indicating that drainage divides shifted over time and that the divide between Nevada and Idaho was offset along a Neoproterozoic lineament. Among the reconstructed drainages are the Tyee and Princeton Rivers from what is present-day north-central Idaho to present-day Oregon and northern California, the Idaho River also from present-day north-central Idaho to the Green River basin and the California River from present-day southernmost California to the Uinta Basin. The northernmost among these rivers may have formed the northern boundary of the Nevadaplano. Some closed drainages also existed, such as in the Elko basin, which formed in response to tectonic deformation.Some normal faulting took place within the Nevadaplano, along with the exposure of core complexes, and generated isolated basins. This may have created regional basins in the late Cretaceous similar to those that lie in the present-day Altiplano-Puna region, and which include the Sheep Pass Formation basin and the long-lived Elko Basin. Lake sediments and volcanic rocks accumulated in these basins. The formation of these basins may have been an early stage of the collapse of the Nevadaplano.Geographical and geological boundariesWest of the Nevadaplano stood the Sierra Nevada, which was volcanically active until 80 million years ago and featured exposed batholiths from former volcanism. Its exact elevation at the time is unclear, with alternate models proposing either that it had already reached a height similar to today's Sierra Nevada or that it rose to present-day height in the Miocene and Pliocene. Alternatively, the Luning-Fencemaker fold-and-thrust belt may have formed the western boundary.It probably did not constitute a drainage divide; various east–west trending valleys cut across the Sierra Nevada at that time. Presently filled with volcanic and sedimentary rocks, these valleys werewide,deep with flat and deeply weathered bottoms. Among these valleys are the Nine Hill and Soda Springs valleys in the Lake Tahoe region and the Stanislaus, Mokelumne and Cataract paleochannels in the Sonora Pass region. There is more evidence for paleovalleys in the northern Sierra Nevada than in the southern, which may either indicate that evidence of cross-Sierra drainage was removed in its southern sector or that the southern Sierra was higher than the central and northern Sierra at the time of the Nevadaplano. Some of these rivers may have been large enough to allow sharks to reach Nevada. The rivers flowing through these valleys deposited the placer gold deposits of California, as part of intense westward sediment transport.Remnants of the Laramide uplands, the Chusca erg or the Sevier fold-and-thrust belt were located east of the Nevadaplano. The boundary was located at a region corresponding to the present-day Wasatch, Santaquin and Canyon Ranges. A relatively short distance may have separated it there from the Western Interior Seaway. The region of what today is northern Nevada during the Oligocene may have been a gently tilted or closed plateau. To the south, the California River may have separated the Nevadaplano from an analogous high plateau to the south, called 'Mexicoplano' or 'Arizonaplano'. The Colorado Plateau was either to the east of the Nevadaplano or else formed an integral part of the plateau.GeologyDuring the Miocene, volcanic activity covered the Nevadaplano with lahars, lava flows and volcanic sediments. In central Nevada and western Utah, at least 71 calderas located at high elevation erupted ignimbrites which propagated for overwestward and across former valleys in the Sierra Nevada, filling them in during the process. In particular, the 28.9 million year old Campbell Creek tuff covered an area ofand propagated far east and west of its source area.The underlying crust had a sialic composition and reached thicknesses of . It consisted of metamorphic rocks and may have contained core complexes like these currently exposed in the Pequop Mountains of Nevada, as well as batholiths like the Idaho Batholith.Ecosystems and climateBased on the fossils found in the Sheep Pass Formation, the Nevadaplano likely had a cold high-elevation climate. Located in the rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada, it was dry, and therefore experienced only weak erosion. The rain shadow extended east of the Nevadaplano. However, precipitation was enough to cut large valleys into the Sierra Nevada, perhaps aided by the then-warm climate. Pulses of erosion may have occurred during Paleogene climate disturbances, such as the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum. Vegetation with temperate climate affinities may have migrated from the Nevadaplano to California when the climate cooled during the Oligocene, founding the temperate forest communities of California.Evidence suggests that lakes and alluvial fans existed on the Nevadaplano, the Sheep Pass Formation constitutes the remnants of such landforms. It is not clear however if the Sheep Pass lake system was at high elevation. Fossils of anurans, birds, bivalves, crustaceans, frogs, lizards, mammals, molluscs, ostracods and snakes have been found there, as well as evidence of algae, charophytes, plants and microbial mats. There are also traces of physical events such as debris flows, periodic desiccation and storms. Lakes formed during the disassembly of the Nevadaplano as well, including these where the Truckee Formation diatomites were emplaced in.ReferencesSourcesGreat Basin Mesozoic North America Cenozoic North America Natural history of Nevada Natural history of California Natural history of Idaho Natural history of Utah Geology of Nevada Geology of Utah Geology of Idaho Geology of California Cretaceous orogenies Paleogene orogenies", "machine_text": "Nevadaplano is a region located in western North America, covering the Great Basin in Nevada and parts of eastern California. The region is characterized by low, flat plains interrupted by mountain ranges and valleys. The term 'plano' comes from the Spanish word for flat, reflecting the region's relatively level topography. The Nevadaplano is a high desert region with a semi-arid climate, characterized by hot summers and cold winters. The region receives low levels of precipitation, resulting in sparse vegetation and dry landscapes. Despite these conditions, the region is home to a variety of species adapted to desert environments, including pronghorn antelope, desert tortoise, and the sage grouse. The region is also home to several protected areas including Great Basin National Park and Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area. Many indigenous tribes have inhabited the Nevadaplano region for thousands of years, including the Paiute, Shoshone, and Washoe. European exploration of the region began in the 18th century, with Spanish explorers mapping the area and establishing trade routes. In the 19th century, the discovery of silver and gold in the region led to a mining boom, with towns like Virginia City and Tonopah springing up. The region also played a role in the westward expansion of the United States, with the Pony Express and Transcontinental Railroad passing through the area. Today, the Nevadaplano region is an important center for mining, agriculture, and tourism, with Las Vegas serving as a hub for the region's economy. The region is also home to several universities and research centers focused on the environment, including the Desert Research Institute and the Great Basin Center for Geothermal Energy.

The term is often used to describe cities that are highly congested, polluted, and where standards of living are below average. The term Pig City can be traced back to the early 1900s when urbanization in the United States was on the rise. Cities were growing at an unprecedented rate, and as a result, the quality of life for urban residents began to decline. Issues such as congestion, pollution, and the spread of diseases were common in urban areas during this time. Over time, the term Pig City has gained widespread use and is now used to describe urban regions around the world that are struggling with issues of overpopulation, poverty, pollution, and other related challenges. The term has been used in several books, films, and other media to describe the negative aspects of urbanization. For example, in the 1984 film 'Repo Man,' the protagonist refers to Los Angeles as a Pig City. While Pig City is often used to describe the negative aspects of urbanization, many cities have made significant strides to improve living conditions for their residents. Urban planning, environmental regulations, and social programs have all played a role in improving the quality of life in cities around the world. In summary, Pig City is a term used to describe cities that are characterized by low living standards, high levels of congestion, pollution, and other related challenges.

Siegfried. Interested in cinematography he started his activity as film critic in 1931 when he was appointed by 'Radio România' and started the first broadcast critics in Romania. He also contributed with film critics to various Romanian magazines.In 1934 he also wrote his first screenplay for a documentary film 'Romania' – directed by Paul Călinescu and Jean Mihail.In 1935 he published his first volume about films: 'The Fairytale factory' () The same year, he published his only play 'Dri-dri' which was awarded the prize of the 'Society of Romanian Dramaturgists' (Societatea Autorilor Dramatici Români) for one-act plays.Film producer and directorIn 1941, Ion Cantacuzino was appointed director of the 'National Office of Cinematography' which had been created in the late 1930s. The main activity of the Office was to release newsreels about the World War II. Besides coordinating the activity of the office, Ion Cantacuzino wrote the screenplays, directed and produced documentaries having cultural subjects: 'The Peleş Castle' (Castelul Peleş) – 1941 or 'Old Customs' (Datini din străbuni) – 1942 or related to the war: 'Romania in war against bolshevism' (România în lupta contra bolşevismului) – 1941, 'Our sacred war' (Războiul nostru sfânt) – 1942, 'We' (Noi) – 1942.Ion Cantacuzino's ambitions were however related to the production of feature films. In 1943 he produced the film 'Stormy Night' (O noapte furtunoasă), a comedy based on a play by Ion Luca Caragiale directed by Jean Georgescu. He then created the Romanian-Italian film production and distribution company 'Cineromit'. The first coproduction was 'Odessa in Flames' (Odessa in fiamme) directed by Carmine Gallone on a screenplay by Gherardo Gherardi and Nicolae Kiriţescu. The next production of 'Cineromit' was scheduled to be produced in Romania. A second film, 'The white squadron' (Squadriglia bianca), directed by Romanian director Ion Sava was released in 1944. The same year, Ion Cantacuzino, as producer, selected Jean Georgescu to direct the film 'A Winter Night's Dream' (Visul unei nopţi de iarnă) based on a play by Tudor Mușatescu. Due to the war, the film could be completed only in 1945. Another project which Ion Cantacuzino was negotiating with the Italians was a historical drama on the life of Stephen the Great, based on a screenplay by Camil Petrescu, starring Amedeo Nazzari and Alida Valli. This project had to be abandoned due to the war.Ion Cantacuzino was also planning to create, in cooperation with the Italians a center for the production of feature films in Romania. The plans for the construction of the center had been designed by architect Octav Doicescu and the Italian government had promised to provide the equipment. The project could not be finalized due to the war.Activity after 1945After the rise to power of the communist regime in Romania, Ion Cantacuzino was blacklisted, because of both his aristocratic background and his antisoviet attitude during the war years. He was arrested for a short time. After his release, he reverted to his second profession and worked for the rest of his life as a psychiatrist at the 'Brâncovenesc Hospital' in Bucharest.However, he did not give up his activities related to the entertainment industry. He translatated various plays for theatrical performances such as Eduardo De Filippo's Filumena Marturano and George Bernard Shaw's Heartbreak House.In the 1960s, without abandoning his profession as psychiatrist, Ion Cantacuzino was able to publish again. He finalized the volumes of memoirs which his mother, actress Maria Filotti had not been able to complete before her death. He also wrote a book on the history of Romanian cinema 'Moments from the past of Romanian film' (1965).DeathIon Filotti Cantacuzino died on August 27, 1975. He is interred at Bellu Cemetery in Bucharest.After his death a last film was produced based on one of his screenplays: 'The insane forest' (Pădurea nebună), released in 1982, based on a novel by Zaharia Stancu.In his memory, the 'Association of Film Critics' has named 'Ion Cantacuzino Award' its distinction for film journalism at the 'International Festival for Independent Film Anonimul' organized each year in Sfântu Gheorghe.ReferencesUniversity of Paris alumni 1908 births 1975 deaths Romanian psychiatrists Romanian film producers Romanian film directors Romanian screenwriters Romanian dramatists and playwrights 20th-century Romanian dramatists and playwrights 20th-century screenwriters Romanian expatriates in France", "machine_text": "Ion Filotti Cantacuzino (October 1, 1899 – May 7, 1956) was a Romanian physicist and professor who made significant contributions to the study of radiation and atomic physics. Born in Bucharest, Cantacuzino received his degree in Physics from the University of Bucharest in 1923, and went on to obtain his Ph.D. from the University of Paris in 1927. After completing his studies, he returned to Romania and began his career in academia as an assistant professor at the University of Bucharest. In 1936, he was appointed as a full professor.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Crips\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Crips is an alliance of street gangs which is based in the coastal regions of southern California. It was founded in Los Angeles, California, in 1969, mainly by Raymond Washington and Stanley Williams. Once a single alliance between two autonomous gangs, it is now a loosely-connected network of individual 'sets', often engaged in open warfare with one another. Traditionally, since around 1973, its members have worn blue clothing.The Crips are one of the largest and most violent associations of street gangs in the United States. With an estimated 30,000 to 35,000 members in 2008, the members have been involved in murders, robberies and drug dealing, among other crimes. They have a long and bitter rivalry with the Bloods.EtymologySome sources suggest that the original name for the alliance, 'Cribs', was narrowed down from a list of many options and chosen unanimously from three final choices, over the Black Overlords and the Assassins. Cribs was chosen to reflect the young age of the majority of the gang members. The name evolved into 'Crips' when gang members began carrying around canes to display their 'pimp' status. People in the neighborhood then began calling them cripples, or 'Crips' for short. In February 1972 the Los Angeles Times used the term. Another source suggests 'Crips' may have evolved from 'Cripplers', a 1970s street gang in Watts, of which Washington was a member. The name had no political, organizational, cryptic, or acronymic meaning, though some have suggested it stands for 'Common Revolution In Progress', a backronym. According to the film Bastards of the Party, directed by a member of the Bloods, the name represented 'Community Revolutionary Interparty Service' or 'Community Reform Interparty Service'.HistoryGang activity in South Central Los Angeles has its roots in a variety of factors dating to the 1950s, including: post-World War II economic decline leading to joblessness and poverty; racial segregation of young African American men, who were excluded from organizations such as the Boy Scouts, leading to the formation of black 'street clubs'; and the waning of black nationalist organizations such as the Black Panther Party and the Black Power Movement.Stanley Tookie Williams met Raymond Lee Washington in 1969, and the two decided to unite their local gang members from the west and east sides of South Central Los Angeles in order to battle neighboring street gangs. Most of the members were 17 years old. Williams however appears to discount the sometimes-cited founding date of 1969 in his memoir, Blue Rage, Black Redemption.In his memoir, Williams also refuted claims that the group was a spin-off of the Black Panther Party or formed for a community agenda, writing that it 'depicted a fighting alliance against street gangs—nothing more, nothing less.' Washington, who attended Fremont High School, was the leader of the East Side Crips, and Williams, who attended Washington High School, led the West Side Crips.Williams recalled that a blue bandana was first worn by Crips founding member Buddha, as a part of his color-coordinated clothing of blue Levis, a blue shirt, and dark blue suspenders. A blue bandana was worn in tribute to Buddha after he was shot and killed on February 23, 1973. The color then became associated with Crips.By 1978, there were 45 Crip gangs, called sets, in Los Angeles. They were heavily involved in the production of PCP, marijuana and amphetamines. On March 11, 1979, Williams, a member of the Westside Crips, was arrested for four murders and on August 9, 1979, Washington was gunned down. Washington had been against Crip infighting and after his death several Crip sets started fighting against each other. The Crips' leadership was dismantled, prompting a deadly gang war between the Rollin' 60 Neighborhood Crips and Eight Tray Gangster Crips that led nearby Crip sets to choose sides and align themselves with either the Neighborhood Crips or the Gangster Crips, waging large-scale war in South Central and other cities. The East Coast Crips (from East Los Angeles) and the Hoover Crips directly severed their alliance after Washington's death. By 1980, the Crips were in turmoil, warring with the Bloods and against each other. The gang's growth and influence increased significantly in the early 1980s when crack cocaine hit the streets and Crip sets began distributing the drug. Large profits induced many Crips to establish new markets in other cities and states. As a result, Crips membership grew steadily and the street gang was one of the nation's largest by the late 1980s. In 1999, there were at least 600 Crip sets with more than 30,000 members transporting drugs in the United States.Membership As of 2015, the Crips gang consists of between approximately 30,000 and 35,000 members and 800 sets, active in 221 cities and 41 U.S. states. The states with the highest estimated number of Crip sets are California, Texas, Oklahoma, and Missouri. Members typically consist of young African American men, but can be white, Hispanic, Asian, and Pacific Islander. Crip sets are not exclusive to the United States, having a presence in the Canadian cities of Montreal and Toronto.In 1992 the LAPD estimated 15,742 Crips in 108 sets; other source estimates were 30,000 to 35,000 in 600 sets in California.Crips have served in the United States armed forces and on military bases in the United States and abroad.PracticesLanguage Some practices of Crip gang life include graffiti and substitutions and deletions of particular letters of the alphabet. The letter 'b' in the word 'blood' is 'disrespected' among certain Crip sets and written with a cross inside it because of its association with the enemy. The letters 'CK', which are interpreted to stand for 'Crip killer', are avoided and replaced by 'cc'. For example, the words 'kick back' are written 'kicc bacc', and block is written as 'blocc'. Many other words and letters are also altered due to symbolic associations. Crips traditionally refer to each other as 'Cuz' or 'Cuzz', which itself is sometimes used as a moniker for a Crip. 'Crab' is the most disrespectful epithet to call a Crip, and can warrant fatal retaliation. Crips in prison modules in the 1970s and 1980s sometimes spoke Swahili to maintain privacy from guards and rival gangs.Initiation ('Jumping in')Although getting 'jumped into the gang' is often commonly thought of as a typical initiation ritual performed on newcomers, some former Crip members such as rapper Brotha Lynch Hung, who joined the 24 Street Crips in Sacramento, California during the 1980s has pointed out that the tradition of getting jumped (beaten) into the gang was 'more of a 1970s (era) practice' rather than a modern or continuing one.Criminal rackets and street-activitiesAs with most criminal street gangs they have traditionally benefited monetarily from a select set of illicit activities such as illegal gambling, drug-dealing, prostitution, burglary, theft and extortion. Along with profitable rackets such as these, they have also been known to participate in vandalism and property crime, often for gang-pride reasons or just enjoyment. This can include public graffiti (tagging) and 'joyriding' in stolen vehicles.Their current primary illicit source of income is presumably in street-level drug distribution, however many Crip members may also make notable amounts of illegal funds from the black market sale of illicit firearms. Historically, the gang’s size and power was largely augmented by the profits from the street sale of crack cocaine throughout the 1980s showing that PCP, amphetamines and other drugs were not as lucrative for them and thus didn’t have as direct of an effect on the group’s increase in influence.Therefore the gang’s initial phase of growth and popularity can, in some way, be directly traced back to the explosion crack cocaine in the United States during the 1980s.Crip-on-Crip rivalriesThe Crips became popular throughout southern Los Angeles as more youth gangs joined; at one point they outnumbered non-Crip gangs by 3 to 1, sparking disputes with non-Crip gangs, including the L.A. Brims, Athens Park Boys, the Bishops, The Drill Company, and the Denver Lanes. By 1971 the gang's notoriety had spread across Los Angeles.By 1971, a gang on Piru Street in Compton, California, known as the Piru Street Boys, formed and associated itself with the Crips as a set. After two years of peace, a feud began between the Pirus and the other Crip sets. It later turned violent as gang warfare ensued between former allies. This battle continued and by 1973, the Pirus wanted to end the violence and called a meeting with other gangs targeted by the Crips. After a long discussion, the Pirus broke all connections to the Crips and started an organization that would later be called the Bloods, a street gang infamous for its rivalry with the Crips.Since then, other conflicts and feuds were started between many of the remaining Crip sets. It is a common misconception that Crip sets feud only with Bloods. In reality, they also fight each other—for example, the Rolling 60s Neighborhood Crips and 83 Gangster Crips have been rivals since 1979. In Watts, the Grape Street Crips and the PJ Watts Crips have feuded so much that the PJ Watts Crips even teamed up with a local Blood set, the Bounty Hunter Bloods, to fight the Grape Street Crips. In the mid-1990s, the Hoover Crips rivalries and wars with other Crip sets caused them to become independent and drop the Crip name, calling themselves the Hoover Criminals.Alliances and rivalriesRivalry with BloodsThe Bloods are the Crips' main stereotypical rival. The Bloods initially formed to provide members protection from the Crips. The rivalry started in the 1960s when Washington and other Crip members attacked Sylvester Scott and Benson Owens, two students at Centennial High School. After the incident, Scott formed the Pirus, while Owens established the West Piru gang. In late 1972, several gangs that felt victimized by the Crips due to their escalating attacks joined the Pirus to create a new federation of non-Crip gangs that later became known as Bloods. Between 1972 and 1979, the rivalry between the Crips and Bloods grew, accounting for a majority of the gang-related murders in southern Los Angeles. Members of the Bloods and Crips occasionally fight each other and, as of 2010, are responsible for a significant portion of gang-related murders in Los Angeles.Alliance with Folk NationIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, as many Crip gang members were being sent to various prisons across the country, an alliance was formed between the Crips and the Folk Nation in Midwest and Southern U.S. prisons. This alliance was established to protect gang members incarcerated in state and federal prison. It is strongest within the prisons, and less effective outside. The alliance between the Crips and Folks is known as '8-ball'. A broken 8-ball indicates a disagreement or 'beef' between Folks and Crips.See alsoAfrican-American organized crime Crip Walk Crime in Los Angeles Gangs in Los Angeles Crips and Bloods: Made in AmericaReferencesFootnotesGeneralLeon Bing (1991).

The group was formed in 1969 by Raymond Washington and Stanley Williams, two teenagers from South Central Los Angeles. The Crips gained notoriety during the 1970s and 1980s thanks to their involvement in drug trafficking, robbery, and violence, which resulted in their members being incarcerated or killed. The Crips originally started as a loose association of African American youth who banded together for protection against the violence of larger gangs such as the Bloods. However, as the group grew in size and power, they began engaging in more serious criminal activities, including drug trafficking, which quickly became their primary source of income. In the early years, the Crips were known for their distinctive blue clothing and use of certain hand signs and graffiti to identify themselves. They also developed a strict set of rules and codes of conduct that governed the behavior of their members, including a strict hierarchy and strict punishments for violating the group's rules. The Crips became embroiled in a bitter rivalry with the Bloods, another major African American street gang, throughout the 1980s and 1990s. This led to a wave of violent clashes between the two groups, with innocent bystanders frequently caught in the crossfire. Over the years, law enforcement agencies have made numerous attempts to crackdown on the Crips and other street gangs, often resulting in the arrest and imprisonment of dozens or even hundreds of members. Despite these efforts, however, the Crips and other gangs continue to operate in many parts of Los Angeles and other cities throughout the United States.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 3434023}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"When God Writes Your Love Story\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "When God Writes Your Love Story: The Ultimate Approach to Guy/Girl Relationships is a 1999 book by Eric and Leslie Ludy, an American married couple. After becoming a bestseller on the Christian book market, the book was republished in 2004 and then revised and expanded in 2009. It tells the story of the authors' first meeting, courtship, and marriage. The authors advise single people not to be physically or emotionally intimate with others, but to wait for the spouse that God has planned for them. The first edition was packaged with a CD single by the Ludys: 'Faithfully', a song they had written specifically to accompany the book.The book is divided into five sections and sixteen chapters. Each chapter is written from the perspective of one of the two authors; nine are by Eric, while Leslie wrote seven, as well as the introduction. The Ludys argue that one's love life should be both guided by and subordinate to one's relationship with God. Leslie writes that God offers new beginnings to formerly unchaste or sexually abused individuals.Other American Christian authors, such as Mark Matlock and Jason Evert, wrote highly of When God Writes Your Love Story. Leah Andrews of the Lewiston Morning Tribune compared When God Writes Your Love Story to other popular Christian books providing alternatives to dating, including Joshua Harris's I Kissed Dating Goodbye and Boy Meets Girl. Eastern University Christian studies professors Margaret and Dwight Peterson responded to the Ludys' book by writing an essay called 'God Does Not Want to Write Your Love Story,' in which the Petersons argue that the book makes young people see marriage as a fantasy comparable to that of Disney Princesses, and that this fantasy often results in disappointment. Rick Holland, an instructor at The Master's College and Seminary and pastor of College and Student Ministries at Grace Community Church, criticized the Ludys' description of dating, claiming it was based too much on anecdotes and not enough on the Bible.Background When God Writes Your Love Story, first published in the United States in 1999,is the third book written by Eric and Leslie Ludy, an American married couple. Like the Ludys' previous two books, His Perfect Faithfulness: The Story of our Courtship (1996) and Romance God's Way (1997), its major themes are romance and Christianity; it tells the story of the authors' first meeting, courtship, and marriage. After becoming a bestseller on the Christian book market, When God Writes Your Love Story was republished in 2004 and then revised and expanded in 2009. More than 350,000 copies were sold worldwide by 2009. Translations of the book have been published in Spanish, German, and Traditional Chinese.Eric and Leslie Ludy met when Eric was 21 and Leslie was 16. They pursued a friendship for several months before starting to court, and married in December 1994, the same month that Eric turned 24. In When God Writes Your Love Story, the Ludys advise single people not to be physically or emotionally intimate with others, but to wait for the life partner that God has planned for them; the Ludys suggest that one should marry this person rather than independently choosing a mate. Also focusing on premarital physical and emotional purity, the authors do not discuss the physical processes of sexual activity. Like many other Christian books about premarital romantic relationships, the Ludys' book explicitly does not present a set of rules to follow or a strategy for romantic success, but rather gives readers a framework for pursuing Christian romantic relationships; the book is intended to be a tool in the creation of the reader's unique romantic relationship rather than as a blueprint explaining what all Christian romantic relationships are supposed to look like.Before the book's release, it was endorsed by Leslie and Les Parrott, authors of Saving Your Marriage Before It Starts; Beverly LaHaye of Concerned Women for America; and Joe White, President of Kanakuk Kamps. The first edition was packaged with a CD single by the Ludys: 'Faithfully', a song they had written specifically to accompany the book, with lyrics discussing the beauty of having a life partner.Content The book is divided into five sections and sixteen chapters. Each chapter is written from the perspective of one of the two authors; nine are by Eric, while Leslie writes seven, as well as the introduction. The first section, 'Desiring a Love Story', addresses sexual desire and lovesickness, suggesting that temporary relationships cannot fulfill those longings. Section Two, 'Preparing for a Love Story', advances ways in which one might, before initiating a romantic relationship, develop the characteristics of a good spouse. The next section, 'Waiting for a Love Story', discusses the practice of fidelity to one's future spouse before meeting them by way of sexual abstinence and argues that waiting indefinitely is worth it even if one's soulmate never arrives. In the fourth section, 'Sweetening a Love Story', the Ludys provide advice on how to proceed once the possibility of a romantic relationship has presented itself. The final section, 'Discovering a God-written Love Story', argues that it is never too late to give God control of one's love life, and that this sacrifice should be made not in expectation of personal benefit but rather to benefit one's future spouse and to honor God.Early in the book, Eric retells a portion of Homer's Odyssey, describing the episode in which Ulysses sails near the land of the Sirens: creatures whose song so attracts seafarers that they sail towards them and crash on the rocks. In this story, Ulysses orders all his men to fill their ears with beeswax and then tie him to the mast; the ship therefore sails through the area unharmed. Still, Ulysses, hearing the Sirens' song the entire time, is tortured by its beauty and his inability to get to the song's source. Eric follows this story with a retelling of the story of Orpheus's encounter with the Sirens. In this story, Orpheus's solution is to play a 'sweeter song' than that of the Sirens; his ship also passes unharmed, his men so entranced by his song that they do not notice the Sirens. Eric then argues from analogy that, normally, those who force themselves to resist premarital sexual and romantic temptations are likely to find the process torturous (like Ulysses), while those who listen to the plans God has for them find waiting for marriage much easier (as it was for Orpheus's crew). Eric expands on the concept of the 'sweeter song' throughout the book and often refers to it. Another frequently mentioned concept in the book is 'the beautiful side of love'; the Ludys use this phrase to refer to a lasting, satisfying romance and contrast this state with such other experiences as breakups, unrequited love, and sexual frustration.The Ludys argue that one's love life should be both guided by and subordinate to one's relationship with God. They suggest that, 'if God's plan and purpose for you is marriage, then the person you will one day marry ... is alive and wandering the earth' and that this knowledge should encourage people to act in such a way that their future spouses would be pleased. The Ludys contest the definition of 'true love' as an emotion; instead, they define 'true love' as the choice to commit to another person no matter what happens. Eric writes that 'there are two ways each of us can approach life: spending our days meeting our needs or looking for ways to meet others' needs. The mystery is that when we spend our life focused on our own needs, we are never satisfied ... but when we pour out our life and focus on how we can serve others ... our deepest needs are met as well!'Leslie argues that non-permanent relationships involving physical or emotional intimacy (or both) result in long-term psychological pain and that one should therefore only become physically or emotionally intimate with one's spouse. Eric retells the Greek myth of the suitors of Penelope, in which Penelope, whose husband Ulysses is erroneously believed to be dead, resists a large number of marriage proposals until Ulysses returns and kills the suitors. Eric uses the story to suggest that one should be faithful to one's future spouse even if it appears that they will never arrive. Eric argues that selfless service is an important part of marriage. He therefore suggests that a good way for a man to make himself ready for his future spouse is to serve his mother and sisters, and that single women should practice serving their fathers and brothers. Leslie writes that she is commonly asked the question 'How will I know when a relationship is from God?' and her response is that people are likelier to recognize that a relationship is from God when they have a 'team ... made up of godly people who can keep us accountable to our commitments, pray with us, and provide a refreshing outside perspective.' She indicates that this team should include one's parents or, if one does not have living Christian parents, other Christians of an older generation. She writes that God offers new beginnings to formerly unchaste or sexually abused individuals.Critical responseDiscussions of contextWhen God Writes Your Love Story is a popular Christian book that provides alternatives to dating. For this reason, Leah Andrews of the Lewiston Morning Tribune compared the book to Joshua Harris's I Kissed Dating Goodbye and Boy Meets Girl. When God Writes Your Love Story also contains Evangelical sexual abstinence teachings. Christine Gardner, a communications professor at Wheaton College, investigates such teachings in Making Chastity Sexy: The Rhetoric of Evangelical Abstinence Campaigns, and discusses the Ludys' book as part of this investigation. Gardner writes that she interviewed a twenty-two-year-old woman who had read When God Writes Your Love Story and 'desperately wanted God to write her love story, but she thought that she would help him out by filling in the blanks.' Gardner argues that the result 'was a fractured fairy tale, one without a happy ending.'In the journal Critical Research on Religion, Courtney Ann Irby of Loyola University Chicago writes that the Ludys disparage secular American culture as overtly sexual and thus an obstacle to Christians. According to Irby, secular beliefs about dating are negatively presented in When God Writes Your Love Story and hookup culture is consistently discussed, although Irby indicates that, since the publication of the Ludys' book, some scholars have disputed the prevalence of casual sex in the United States. Irby suggests that the Ludys have no discernible qualifications to speak on the issues they discuss, but rather justify their message by emphasising their own personal experience as the reason for their authority. She writes that the Ludys recognize their lack of expertise and therefore emphasize trusting God as being more important than learning from the specific stories in the book. Irby suggests that the Ludys' book is, in these respects, similar to many other Evangelical books about premarital romantic relationships, such as Dannah Gresh's And the Bride Wore White, Elisabeth Elliot's Passion and Purity and Quest for Love, Don Raunikar's Choosing God's Best, Ben Young's and Sam Adams' The Ten Commandments of Dating, Henry Cloud's and John Townsend's Boundaries in Dating, Alex Chediak's 5 Paths to the Love of Your Life, and Joshua Harris's I Kissed Dating Goodbye and Boy Meets Girl.Christian responses to the book's adviceChristine A. Colón and Bonnie E. Field, two single women in their thirties, expressed their frustrations with the Ludys' book in Singled Out: Why Celibacy Must Be Reinvented in Today's Church. Colón, an English professor at Wheaton College; and Field, a former English professor at Wayland Baptist University, criticize Leslie Ludy's account of her own wait for God to bring her a romantic partner. They argue that 'the language Ludy uses to describe her time of waiting and trusting implies a difficult and long struggle that is finally rewarded by God' and suggests that a long wait results in an even greater reward, a concept that Colón and Field, despite acknowledging as commonplace, disagree with and trace back to William Shakespeare's Cymbeline, which states 'the more delay'd, delighted.' Singled Out suggests that, because Leslie was only 16 when she met Eric, her story is unlikely to inspire hope in older singles.Colón and Field compare When God Writes Your Love Story to Derek Prince's God Is a Matchmaker, and argue that Prince's book better expresses the concept that God allows some people to receive their soulmates quickly, while requiring others to undergo a long wait. While the Ludys' book suggests that it is worth waiting for a soulmate because the wait indicates a better prize, Colón and Field favour Prince's reasons for advocating waiting for one's soulmate, which are that doing so tests one's faith and that 'God has required many of His choicest servants to wait long periods for the fulfillment of His promise or purpose.'Margaret and Dwight Peterson, an American married couple who are Christian Studies professors at Eastern University, teach a course together called 'Christian Marriage' and were very critical of When God Writes Your Love Story. They responded to the Ludys' book by writing an essay called 'God Does Not Want to Write Your Love Story.' They write therein that, while they read When God Writes Your Love Story, 'it began to dawn on us with particular clarity how different these stories of romance are from any traditionally Christian understanding of marriage.' In response to Leslie Ludy's recommendation that a single woman should seek to be God's princess until becoming the princess of a human prince, the Petersons argue that this analogy makes young people see marriage as a fantasy comparable to that of Disney Princesses, and that this fantasy often results in disappointment. While referencing When God Writes Your Love Story specifically on several occasions, the Petersons acknowledge that the Ludys' book is one of many books with this premise and write that 'it is the entire genre that is problematic.'Rick Holland, an instructor at The Master's College and Seminary and pastor of College and Student Ministries at Grace Community Church, criticized the Ludys' description of dating, claiming it was based too much on anecdotes and not enough on the Bible. Nonetheless, he commended the couple on the relevant Bible verses they do quote and he argued that the advice the Ludys share in the book is sound and that their story is an encouraging one.When God Writes Your Love Story was received positively by some American Christian authors. In Freshman: The College Student's Guide to Developing Wisdom, Mark Matlock, an ordained minister and youth pastor recommends When God Writes Your Love Story to college students. He describes the Ludys' book as funny, honest, and candid. Jason Evert, a Catholic author and chastity speaker, wrote positively of When God Writes Your Love Story in his book If You Really Loved Me: 100 Questions on Dating, Relationships, and Sexual Purity. Evert commends Leslie Ludy writing about the importance of listening intently and regularly to God's voice in seeking discernment about romantic relationships. Also in If You Really Loved Me, Evert praises a passage from When God Writes Your Love Story in which Leslie Ludy recalls having spoken with a group of young men who all agreed that the most desirable women were those who were slow to establish strong emotional attachments to potential romantic partners, and that the least desirable women were those who were emotionally promiscuous. According to Evert, these men are right; he uses the passage to support his argument that lack of sexual experience is attractive.Commentators have also noted the song 'Faithfully' that accompanied the book. The Petersons criticized it, arguing that its lyrics suggest that singles should seek a kind of unachievable perfection in their future marriage and spouse. On the other hand, in Eyes Wide Open: Avoiding the Heartbreak of Emotional Promiscuity, Brienne Murk, a Christian musician and public speaker, identifies 'Faithfully' as one of her favourite songs.In 22 and Single: A Coming of Age Story, Katie Kiesler wrote that, after reading the first chapter of When God Writes Your Love Story, she stopped because 'it was too hard to hear about the wonderful way in which God brought another perfect couple together — because it wasn't happening for me.' She wrote that her friends kept recommending the book to her, even after she had tried starting it. She eventually decided that the reason she didn't like the book was her own selfishness in seeking to fulfill her own desires rather than leaving her desires for God to work out.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Jackson Beardy\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Jackson Beardy (July 24, 1944 – December 7, 1984) was an Indigenous Anishinaabe artist born in Canada. His works are characterized by scenes from Ojibwe and Cree oral traditions and many focus on the relationship between humans and nature. He belonged to the Woodland School of Art and was a prominent member of the Indian Group of Seven. His work has contributed to the recognition of Indigenous contemporary art within Canada.Early life and educationJackson Beardy was born July 24, 1944. He was the son of John Beardy and Dinah Monias and fifth of 13 children. Beardy's father supported the family as a trapper, hunter, pedlar, gold miner, fisherman and fish filleter. The Beardys lived in a single-roomed log cabin but despite the lack of material goods, John Beardy provided the necessities and Beardy appears to have had a happy childhood. He lived with his grandmother, from whom he learned the oral traditions and legends of his Anishinaabe ancestors, for most of his childhood.Beardy attended residential school at Portage la Prairie in Southern Manitoba at the age of seven. Here, he was separated from his sister and could not communicate with her during the school years. Before attending the school, he did not speak English. Beardy quickly distanced himself from the forced nature of education that all Indigenous peoples in that area underwent at the residential schools, and it was from these lessons that he began to assert his Indigenous culture. Beardy's reaction to the mental de-structuring process at the school was to become the school wit.It was at the residential school that he learned how to draw and paint. A kind school teacher, Mary Morris, encouraged Beardy's art and stayed in touch with Beardy after he left the school. When drawing at the school, he was not permitted to visually express the Anishinaabe oral narratives.At the age of 16, the authorities allowed the students to leave the school, however the principal of the residential school promised Beardy an art education if he stayed two more years to gain his high school certificate. Beardy then chose to stay another two years. At the age of 18, Beardy approached the principal to ask for the promised art education, but quickly learned that the principal would not allow him the art education after all. The principal did not believe that being an artist would make Beardy a 'decent' citizen. Instead, he offered Beardy a course in commercial art, since this would be more economically sustainable. When learning this, young Beardy angrily told him, that he would show him that he is capable of becoming an artist.During his last year in high school, his grades began to fall and Beardy turned to alcoholism. After failing high school, Beardy still wished to pursue an art education; he completed the failed courses and was accepted into a course on commercial art. He completed these courses at Technical Vocational High School and graduated in 1964. Subsequently, Beardy completed his education at the School of Art at the University of Manitoba in 1966.Art career Jackson Beardy's first solo exhibition was in 1965 at the University of Winnipeg. He had many subsequent solo exhibitions throughout 1960s and 1970s. In 1967, Beardy was commissioned to create pieces to commemorate the Canadian centennial. That same year he was invited to serve as consultant for the 'Canadian Indian Pavilion' at Expo 67.In 1972 Jackson Beardy, Alex Janvier, and Daphne Odjig held a joint exhibition at the Winnipeg Art Gallery titled 'Treaty Numbers 23, 287, 1171'. The name of the piece was a reference to the numbered treaties that were negotiated with the Canadian government of each artist's band. From this 1973 exhibition, a group of Indigenous artists formed the 'Professional Native Indian Artists Association', better known as the 'Indian Group of Seven'. Included alongside Jackson Beardy was Alex Janvier, Norval Morrisseau, Daphne Odjig, Carl Ray, Eddy Cobiness and Joseph Sanchez. They collaborated to move their work toward larger mainstream acceptance. They committed to maintaining Indigenous control over Indigenous works of art and emphasized artistic rather than anthropological value.From 1974 through 1976, Beardy contributed artwork to the covers of numerous books including Ojibway Heritage by Basil Johnston, When the Morning Stars Sang Together by John Morgan, and Almighty Voice by Leonard Peterson. Also in 1976, Beardy was one of the contributing artists for a Royal Ontario Museum exhibit called, 'Contemporary Native Art of Canada: The Woodland Indians' which travelled to Germany and England.In 1977, Beardy had an exhibition in Vancouver, BC entitled, 'Images for a Canadian Heritage'.From 1982 through 1983, Jackson Beardy was senior arts advisor for the Federal Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, now known as Indian and Northern Affairs Canada. He developed the 'Indian Fine Arts Guide' which outlined procedures for the acquisition of Indigenous art. Additionally during this time, he held the position of art advisor and cultural consultant for the Manitoba Museum of Man and Nature.In 1984, Beardy was commissioned to paint a mural at the intersection of Selkirk and Powers in Winnipeg. The paintings were to depict 'Peace and Harmony' but Beardy died before he could complete it. It was completed posthumously by students from R.B. Russell Vocational High School. The piece was revealed on September 5, 1985.In celebration of his body of work, Beardy's art was shown at the Winnipeg Art Gallery from 1993 to 1994. It was again shown in 1995, in an exhibit called 'Jackson Beardy: A Life's Work' at the Thunder Bay Art Gallery. Beardy's artwork has been displayed in many museums and other notable institutions both domestically and internationally.Art style Beardy, as well as other members from the Professional Native Indian Artists Incorporated, was a member of the Woodlands School of Indigenous Art. This Woodlands style of artistic expression can be seen in the central role Beardy's Anishinaabe heritage plays within his work. Using a variety of supports, such as canvas, birch bark, and beaver skins, Beardy's artwork often showcases traditional figures from Ojibwe and Cree oral traditions. His art draws on a deep knowledge of his native Cree tradition gained from a close childhood relationship with his grandmother and from his systematic collection of myths and legends in northern Manitoba.His distinctive graphic style contrasts precise, black outlines with defined areas of rich colour. His art expresses fundamental cosmological and spiritual concepts such as balance in nature, regeneration and growth, and the interdependence of humans and nature.Death Jackson Beardy died on December 7, 1984 in Winnipeg, Manitoba from complications after a heart attack.NotesReferencesHughes, Kenneth.

His art was often inspired by traditional Indigenous stories and legends, as well as by the natural world and its forces. Beardy was born in Garden Hill, Manitoba, of the Oji-Cree people. He grew up near the lake at Garden Hill, and would return to this theme frequently in his art. His art education began in 1963 at the Fine Arts Department of the Provincial Institute of Technology and Art (now the Alberta College of Art and Design) in Calgary, Alberta. However, he found the approach too focused on Western principles and left after two years. Beardy then turned to study with Carl Ray and Norval Morrisseau, two leading Indigenous artists who were revitalizing indigenous art traditions, specifically the form now called the Woodland School. He also was influenced by attending a workshop led by the internationally renowned artist Daphne Odjig in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The Woodland School artists, like Ray, Morrisseau, Odjig, and Blake Debassige, focused on Indigenous legends and spiritual experiences that inspired their work. Beardy was also an important advocate for Indigenous arts. He was one of the founders of the Professional Native Indian Artists Association (PNIA) in 1973. Beardy saw PNIA as an opportunity to establish Indigenous art as contemporary art and to reject the colonial stereotypes of Indigenous art as a 'primitive' or 'craft-based' tradition. The PNIA exhibition 'Tribal Images,' held in Toronto in 1973, was a groundbreaking moment, and Beardy contributed several works to the show. Sadly, Jackson Beardy died in a car accident in 1984 at the age of 40. His work, however, still resonates powerfully within the contemporary Indigenous art movements of Canada. His artistic vision and his advocacy for Indigenous art helped to change the way that this art is understood and valued.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 17607221}

therefore he tells the people of Adano that they may bring their carts into the town (among other things, the town has no source of water without the carts).Later in the novel, Joppolo gains the admiration of U.S. Navy Lieutenant Livingston, who invites Joppolo to come have a drink with some of his Navy buddies.While there, Joppolo tells them of the town's need for a bell.Commander Robertson realizes that they might have exactly the bell that Adano needs, aboard the USS Corelli.The arrival of the bell to the town coincides with a party that the town is hosting for Joppolo to express their gratitude for all of his great doings.Although the bell has arrived at the town, the engineers say that it will take them until the next morning to install it.At the same time Sergeant Borth, one of Major Joppolo's aides, finds a note from General Marvin that says that Joppolo has been relieved of duty as administrator of Adano because he countermanded General Marvin's order.Sergeant Borth tells Joppolo that he has been relieved from duty while they are at the party and hands Joppolo the order.The next morning, Joppolo leaves Adano, but does not say goodbye to anyone because he does not think he could.As the jeep is driving away, he tells the driver to stop for a moment.They hear the clear sound of a loud bell.Characters Major Victor Joppolo: The protagonist of the story, is the interim mayor of the Italian coastal town of Adano.He is sincerely interested in restoring happiness and prosperity and goes to great lengths to satisfy the people's needs.Sergeant Borth: A sergeant in the Military Police platoon assigned to garrison Adano; admires the major's changes to the town.Captain Purvis: Under Major Joppolo and the officer in charge of the military police in Adano.General Marvin: General of the American 34th Infantry Division in Italy.He orders that all carts stay out of Adano and relieves Major Joppolo of his position when he discovers that the major countermanded his order.Tina: The daughter of Tomasino, Major Joppolo develops an affinity for her over the course of the novel, even though it may be because she wants the major to find out whether her sweetheart is still alive.Giuseppe: Major Joppolo's interpreter.Zito: Major Joppolo's usher.Tomasino: The leader of the fishermen.Tomasino, though skeptical at first, is thrilled when Major Joppolo allows him and his men to go out and fish.Cacopardo:A rich man, he owns the sulfur refinery of Adano.His chiasmus seen throughout the book: 'Cacopardo is sulphur and sulphur is Cacopardo.'Mercurio Salvatore: The crier of the town.Gargano: Chief of the police in Adano.Mayor Nasta: Former fascist mayor of Adano, he comes back to the town and is ridiculed by all.Lieutenant Livingston: A United States Navy lieutenant, he is in charge of the port of Adano.Reception A Bell for Adano was published in 1944 and won the Pulitzer Prize in 1945. Time magazine in 1944 wrote, 'The mood of A Bell for Adano is bitter. Its humor is raucous and wild. At its worst, it descends to college humorous magazine slapstick. At its best it is a superb piece of reporting. Read unimaginatively, it is a deadly account of U.S. official incompetence. Stripped of its humor, it is the story of a battle for democracy, no less real for being fought without arms, more important than the military engagement that preceded it.' Kenneth Dave Schadt of the Vancouver Public Library later noted, 'The novel achieved huge popularity and was hailed as a classic war novel. The book is rich in characterization, and it is recognized as a classic study in leadership. Another possible reason it was so well received was that the novel portrays the American army in a positive light and shows how democracy is inherently superior to Fascism.'Connections to World War IIAdano is a fictional Sicilian port town modeled after the real town of Licata, Sicily, one of the disembarkation towns on the beaches of Mollarella and Poliscia during the Allied occupation of Italy. Just like Adano in the novel, Licata has a shipping and sulfur industry and a fishing port, and its largest church is the Church of Sant'Angelo. Additionally, Benito Mussolini did have Licata's 700-year-old bell melted to make ammunition. Major Joppolo is based on the American military governor of Licata named Frank E. Toscani. John Hersey visited Toscani for four or five days during the war and created Victor Joppolo from him, noting that he held a job as a civilian clerk in the New York City Sanitation Department. General Marvin is a depiction of the World War II General Patton, who was known for his bitterness and cruelty, but also his effectiveness.Adaptations The novel was the basis of Paul Osborn's 1944 Broadway play A Bell for Adano, starring Fredric March.A film version of the novel, A Bell for Adano (1945), starred John Hodiak.A Bell for Adano was presented on Star Playhouse on October 11, 1953.

It portrays the story of an American major, Victor Joppolo, who is sent to the town of Adano in Sicily during World War II to establish democratic governance. The novel won the Pulitzer Prize in 1945, and in 1945 it was adapted into a successful Broadway play starring Fredric March. The novel focuses on the experiences of Major Joppolo as he tries to introduce democracy to Adano, despite the resistance from the locals who are used to the authoritarian rule of the town's Prince. Joppolo is initially faced with a difficult task as he is tasked with finding a replacement for the town's missing historic bell, which was stolen by the retreating German Army. After months of negotiation and effort, Joppolo ultimately succeeds in finding a bell, which he presents to the people of Adano as an emblem of democracy. As the story progresses, Joppolo becomes deeply involved in the life of the town, and he grows to love its people and its culture. He also becomes entangled in a complex situation when he tries to intervene in the fate of a teenage fisherman who has been wrongly accused of a crime. Joppolo's efforts to obtain justice for the boy ultimately result in a dramatic confrontation with the Prince, who is content to sacrifice the boy's life to maintain his power. The novel is often seen as a powerful statement about the importance of democracy and freedom, and it has been praised for its realistic and engaging depiction of life in a small Italian town during wartime.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Mohicans\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Mohican ( or , alternate spelling: Mahican) are an Eastern Algonquian Native American tribe that historically spoke an Algonquian language. As part of the Eastern Algonquian family of tribes, they are related to the neighboring Lenape, who occupied territory to the south as far as the Atlantic coast. The Mohican occupied the upper tidal Hudson River Valley, including the confluence of the Mohawk River (where present-day Albany, New York, developed) and into western New England centered on the upper Housatonic River watershed. After 1680, due to conflicts with the powerful Mohawk to the west during the Beaver Wars, many were driven southeastward across the present-day Massachusetts western border and the Taconic Mountains to Berkshire County around Stockbridge, Massachusetts.They combined with Lenape Native Americans (a branch known as the Munsee) in Stockbridge, and later the people moved west away from pressure of European settlement. They settled in what became Shawano County, Wisconsin. Most eastern American Indian populations were forced to reservations in Indian Territory during the 1830s, and other reservations in the American West later. Decades later they eventually formed the federally recognized Stockbridge-Munsee Community with registered members of the Munsee people and have areservation.Following the disruption of the American Revolutionary War, most of the Mohican descendants first migrated westward to join the Iroquois Oneida on their reservation in central New York. The Oneida gave them about 22,000 acres for their use. After more than two decades, in the 1820s and 1830s, the Oneida and the Stockbridge moved again, pressured to sell their lands and relocate to northeastern Wisconsin under the federal Indian Removal program. A group of Mohican also migrated to Ontario, Canada to live with the predominately Iroquois Six Nations of the Grand River reserve.The tribe identified by the place where they lived:(or 'people of the continually flowing waters'). The wordrefers to a great sea or body of water, and the Hudson River reminded them of their place of origin, so they named the Hudson River , or the river where there are people from the continually flowing waters. Therefore, they, along with other tribes living along the Hudson River (such as the Munsee to their west, known by the dialect of Lenape that they spoke, and Wappinger) to the south, were called 'the River Indians' by the Dutch and English.The Dutch heard and transliterated the term for the people of the area in their own language, variously as: Mahigan, Mahikander, Mahinganak, Maikan and Mawhickon, among other variants, which the English later expressed as Mohican or Mahican, in a transliteration to their own spelling system. The French, adopting names used by their Indian allies in Canada, knew the Mohican as the(or wolves). They referred to the Iroquois Confederacy as the 'Snake People', as they were called by some competitors, or 'Five Nations', representing their original tribes).Like the Munsee and Wappinger peoples, the Mohican were Algonquian-speaking, part of a large language family related also to the Lenape people, who occupied coastal areas from western Long Island to the Delaware River valley to the south.In the late twentieth century, the Mohican joined other former New York tribes, including the Oneida and some other Iroquois nations, in filing land claims against New York for what were considered unconstitutional purchases of their lands after the Revolutionary War. Only the federal government had constitutional authority to deal with the Indian nations. In 2010, outgoing governor David Paterson announced a land exchange with the Stockbridge-Munsee that would enable them to build a large casino onin Sullivan County in the Catskills, as a settlement in exchange for dropping their larger claim in Madison County. The deal had many opponents.Territory In their own language, the Mohican identified collectively as the , 'people of the great tidal river'.At the time of their first contact with Europeans traders along the river in the 1590s, the Mohican were living in and around the Hudson River (or ). After 1609, at the time of the Dutch settlement of New Netherland, they also ranged along the eastern Mohawk River and the Hoosic River, and south along the Hudson to the Roeliff Jansen Kill, where they bordered on the Wappinger people. This nation inhabited the river area and its interior southward to today's New York City.Most of the Mohican communities lay along the upper tidal reaches of the Hudson River and along the watersheds of Kinderhook-Claverack-Taghkanic Creek, the Roeliff Jansen Kill, Catskil Creek, and adjacent areas of the Housatonic watershed. Mohican territory reached along Hudson River watersheds northeastward to Wood Creek just south of Lake Champlain.Culture The Mohican villages were governed by hereditary sachems advised by a council of clan elders. They had a matrilineal kinship system, with property and inheritance (including such hereditary offices) passed through the maternal line. Moravian missionary John Heckewelder and early anthropologist Lewis H. Morgan both learned from Mohican informants that their matrilineal society was divided into three phratries (Turkey, Turtle, and Wolf). These were divided into clans or subclans, including a potentially prominent Bear Clan. This finding is supported by the evidence of Mohican signatures on treaties and land deeds (see the works of Shirley Dunn).A general council of sachems met regularly at Scodac (east of present-day Albany) to decide important matters affecting the entire confederacy. In his history of the Indians of the Hudson River, Edward Manning Ruttenber described the clans of the Mohican as the Bear, the Turkey, the Turtle, and the Wolf. Each had a role in the lives of the people, and the Wolf served as warriors in the north to defend against the Mohawk, the easternmost of the Five Nations of the Iroquois.Like the Munsee-speaking communities to their south, Mohican villages followed a dispersed settlement pattern, with each community likely dominated by a single lineage or clan. The villages usually consisted of a small cluster of small and mid-sized longhouses, and were located along floodplains. During times of war, they built fortifications in defensive locations (such as along ridges) as places of retreat. Their cornfields were located near their communities; the women also cultivated varieties of squash, beans, sunflowers, and other crops from the Eastern Agricultural Complex. Horticulture and the gathering and processing of nuts (hickory, butternuts, black walnuts and acorns), fruits (blueberries, raspberries, juneberries among many others), and roots (groundnuts, wood lilies, arrowroot among others) provided much of their diet. This was supplemented by the men hunting game (turkeys, deer, elk, bears, and moose in the Taconics) and fishing (sturgeon, alewives, shad, eels, lamprey and striped bass).Language The now extinct Mohican language belonged to the Eastern Algonquian branch of the Algonquian language family.HistoryMohican Confederacy The Mohican were a confederacy of five tribes and as many as forty villages.Mohican proper, lived in the vicinity of today's Albany (, 'the fireplace of the Mahican Nation') west towards the Mohawk River and to the northwest to Lake Champlain and Lake George, lived along the west shore of the Hudson River above the Catskill Creek Wawyachtonoc (or ,'eddy people' or 'people of the curving channel'), lived in Dutchess County and Columbia County eastward to the Housatonic River in Litchfield County, Connecticut, main village was Weantinock, additional villages: Shecomeco, Wechquadnach, Pamperaug, Bantam, Weataug, ScaticookWestenhuck (from , 'on the other side of the mountains'), the name of a village near Great Barrington, Massachusetts. Often called the 'Housatonic people', they lived in the Housatonic Valley in Connecticut and Massachusetts and in the vicinity of Great Barrington, which they called , meaning 'the place downstream'Wiekagjoc (from , 'upper reaches of a river'), lived east of the Hudson Rivers near the city of Hudson, Columbia County, New YorkConflict with the MohawkThe Algonquians (Mohican) and Iroquois (Mohawk) were traditional competitors and enemies. Iroquois oral tradition, as recorded in the Jesuit Relations, speaks of a war between the Mohawks and an alliance of the Susquehannock and Algonquin (sometime between 1580 and 1600). This was perhaps in response to the formation of the League of the Iroquois.In September 1609 Henry Hudson encountered Mohican villages just below present day Albany, with whom he traded goods for furs. Hudson returned to Holland with a cargo of valuable furs which immediately attracted Dutch merchants to the area. The first Dutch fur traders arrived on the Hudson River the following year to trade with the Mohicans. Besides exposing them to European epidemics, the fur trade destabilized the region.In 1614, the Dutch decided to establish a permanent trading post on Castle Island, on the site of a previous French post that had been long abandoned; but first they had to arrange a truce to end fighting which had broken out between the Mohicans and Mohawks. Fighting broke out again between the Mohicans and Mohawks in 1617, and with Fort Nassau badly damaged by a freshet, the Dutch abandoned the fort. In 1618, having once again negotiated a truce, the Dutch rebuilt Fort Nassau on higher ground. Late that year, Fort Nassau was destroyed by flooding and abandoned for good. In 1624, Captain Cornelius Jacobsen May sailed theupriver and landed eighteen families of Walloons on a plain opposite Castle Island. They commenced to construct Fort Orange.The Mohicans invited the Algonquin and Montagnais to bring their furs to Fort Orange as an alternate to French traders in Quebec. Seeing the Mohicans extended their control over the fur trade, the Mohawk attacked, with initial success. In 1625 or 1626 the Mohicans destroyed the easternmost Iroquois 'castle'. The Mohawks then re-located south of the Mohawk River, closer to Fort Orange. In July 1626 many of the settlers moved to New Amsterdam because of the conflict. The Mohicans requested help from the Dutch and Commander Daniel Van Krieckebeek set out from the fort with six soldiers. Van Krieckebeek, three soldiers, and twenty-four Mohicans were killed when their party was ambushed by the Mohawk about a mile from the fort. The Mohawks withdrew with some body parts of those slain for later consumption as a demonstration of supremacy.War continued to rage between the Mohicans and Mohawks throughout the area from Skahnéhtati (Schenectady) to Kinderhoek Kinderhook. By 1629, the Mohawks had taken over territories on the west bank of the Hudson River that were formerly held by the Mohicans. The conflict caused most of the Mohican to migrate eastward across the Hudson River into western Massachusetts and Connecticut.The Mohawks gained a near-monopoly in the fur trade with the Dutch by prohibiting the nearby Algonquian-speaking tribes to the north or east to trade.Stockbridge Many Mohicans settled in the town of Stockbridge, Massachusetts, where they gradually became known as the 'Stockbridge Indians'. , one of their chiefs, accompanied three Mohawk chiefs on a state visit to Queen Anne and her government in England in 1710. They were popularly referred to as the Four Mohawk Kings.The Stockbridge Indians allowed Protestant missionaries, including Jonathan Edwards, to live among them.In the 18th century, many converted to Christianity, while keeping certain traditions of their own.They fought on the side of the British colonists in the French and Indian War (also known as the Seven Years' War).During the American Revolution, they sided with the colonists.In the eighteenth century, some of the Mohicans developed strong ties with missionaries of the Moravian Church from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, who founded a mission at their village ofin Dutchess County, New York. Henry Rauch reached out to two Mohican leaders, , also known as ; and , who took him back to Shekomeko. They named him the new religious teacher. Over time, Rauch won listeners, as the Mohicans had suffered much from disease and warfare, which had disrupted their society. Early in 1742, Shabash and two other Mohicans accompanied Rauch to Bethlehem, where he was to be ordained as a deacon. The three Mohicans were baptized on 11 February 1742 in John de Turk's barn nearby at Oley, Pennsylvania. Shabash was the first Mohican of Shekomeko to adopt the Christian religion. The Moravians built a chapel for the Mohican people in 1743. They defended the Mohican against European colonists' exploitation, trying to protect them against land encroachment and abuses of liquor.On a 1738 visit to New York, the Mohicans spoke to Governor Lewis Morris concerning the sale of their land near Shekomeko. The Governor promised they would be paid as soon as the lands were surveyed.He suggested that for their own security, they should mark off their square mile of land they wished to keep, which the Mohicans never did. In September 1743, still under the Acting-Governor George Clarke the land was finally surveyed by New York Assembly agents and divided into lots, a row of which ran through the Indians' reserved land. With some help from the missionaries, on 17 October 1743 and already under the new Royal Governor George Clinton, Shabash put together a petition of names of people who could attest that the land in which one of the lots was running through was theirs. Despite Shabash's appeals, his persistence, and the missionaries' help, the Mohicans lost the case. The lots were eventually bought up by European-American colonists and the Mohicans were forced out of Shekomeko. Some who opposed the missionaries' work accused them of being secret Catholic Jesuits (who had been outlawed from the colony in 1700) and of working with the Mohicans on the side of the French. The missionaries were summoned more than once before colonial government, but also had supporters. In the late 1740s the colonial government at Poughkeepsie expelled the missionaries from New York, in part because of their advocacy of Mohican rights. European colonists soon took over the Mohican land.Revolutionary WarIn August 1775, the Six Nations staged a council fire near Albany, after news of Bunker Hill had made war seem imminent. After much debate, they decided that such a war was a private affair between the British and the colonists (known as Rebels, Revolutionaries, Congress-Men, American Whigs, or Patriots), and that they should stay out of it. Mohawk Chief Joseph Brant feared that the Indians would lose their lands if the Colonists achieved independence. Sir William Johnson, his son John Johnson and son-in-law Guy Johnson and Brant used all their influence to engage the Iroquois to fight for the British cause. The Mohawk, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca ultimately became allies and provided warriors for the battles in the New York area. The Oneida and Tuscarora sided with the Colonists. The Mohicans, who as Algonquians were not part of the Iroquois Confederacy, sided with the Patriots, serving at the Siege of Boston, and the battles of Saratoga and Monmouth.In 1778 they lost forty warriors of their Stockbridge Militia, around half 'Stockbridge Indians' who were remnants of both Mohican and Wappinger tribes, in a British attack on the land of the van Cortlandt family. (In 1888, the property became Van Courtland Park in the Bronx, New York.) The Battle of Kingsbridge decimated the troop's ranks.It received a commendation from George Washington, was paid 1,000 and dismissed.Move to Oneida, New York After the Revolution the citizens of the new United States forced many Native Americans off their land and westward. In the 1780s, groups of Stockbridge Indians, today regarded as Stockbridge Munsee, moved from Massachusetts to a new location among the Oneida people in central New York, who had been granted areservation for their service to the Patriots, out of their former territory of . They called their settlement New Stockbridge. Some individuals and families, mostly people who were old or those with special ties to the area, remained behind at Stockbridge.The central figures of Mohican society, including the chief sachem, Joseph Quanaukaunt, and his counselors and relatives, were part of the move to New Stockbridge. At the new town, the Stockbridge emigrants controlled their own affairs and combined traditional ways with the new as they chose. After learning from the Christian missionaries, the Stockbridge Indians were experienced in English ways. At New Stockbridge they replicated their former town. While continuing as Christians, they retained their language and Mohican cultural traditions. In general, their evolving Mohican identity was still rooted in traditions of the past.Removal to Wisconsin In the 1820s and 1830s, most of the Stockbridge Indians moved to Shawano County, Wisconsin, where they were promised land by the US government under the policy of Indian removal. In Wisconsin, they settled on reservations with the Lenape (called Munsee after one of their major dialects), who were also speakers of one of the Algonquian languages.Together, the two formed a band and are federally recognized as the Stockbridge-Munsee Community.Their 22,000-acre reservation is known as that of the Stockbridge-Munsee Band of Mohican Indians and is located near the town of Bowler. Since the late twentieth century, they have developed the North Star Mohican Resort and Casino on their reservation, which has successfully generated funds for tribal welfare and economic development.Land claims In the late twentieth century, the Stockbridge-Munsee were among tribes filing land claims against New York, which had been ruled to have unconstitutionally acquired land from Indians without Senate ratification. The Stockbridge-Munsee filed a land claim against New York state forin Madison County, the location of its former property. In 2011, outgoing governor David Paterson announced having reached a deal with the tribe. They would be given nearlyin Madison County and give up their larger claim in exchange for the state's giving them 330 acres of land in Sullivan County in the Catskill Mountains, where the government was trying to encourage economic development. The federal government had agreed to take the land in trust, making it eligible for development as a gaming casino, and the state would allow gaming, an increasingly important source of revenue for American Indians. Race track and casinos, private interests and other tribes opposed the deal.In 2011, the Stockbridge-Munsee Community Band of the Mohican Indians regained ownership 156 acres along the Hudson River, a tract known as Papscanee Island Nature Preserve near East Greenbush and Schodack. The land was donated to descendants of its indigenous inhabitants by the Open Space Initiative. Prior to colonization, the island was used for ceremonies by the Mohicans before it was acquired by Dutch merchant Kiliaen Van Rensselaer in 1637. The property is managed by Rensselaer County and the Rensselaer Land Trust for public access and protection, while owned by the Mohicans.Representation in media James Fenimore Cooper based his novel, The Last of the Mohicans, on the Mohican tribe. His description includes some cultural aspects of the Mohegan, a different Algonquian tribe that lived in eastern Connecticut. Cooper set his novel in the Hudson Valley, Mohican land, but used some Mohegan names for his characters, such as Uncas.The novel has been adapted for the cinema more than a dozen times, the first time in 1920. Michael Mann directed a 1992 adaptation, which starred Daniel Day-Lewis as a Mohican-adopted white man.Notable membersEtow Oh Koam, Mohican sachem and one of the Four Indian Kings, who, with three Mohawk leaders, made a state visit to Queen Anne and her government in England in 1710.Hendrick Aupaumut, (1757–1830) sachem, historian, and American Revolutionary War captainSteve Conliff, (1949-2006) political writer, historian, Yippie activistBrent Michael Davids, (b. 1959) composer/flautistBill Miller, (b. 1955) musicianElecta Quinney, (1798–1885) first public teacher and school mistress in WisconsinJohn Wannuaucon Quinney, (1797–1855) diplomatDon Coyhis (born August 16, 1943), addiction specialist, Native American health activist and author.See alsoNative American tribes in MassachusettsReferencesBibliographyAupaumut, Hendrick.

The name 'Mohican' means 'the people of the waters that are never still' or 'people of the continually moving waters.' Their traditional territory also extended into western Massachusetts and southwestern Vermont. The Mohicans were a member of the Algonquian language family. They were known for their hunting and fishing skills and were also skilled in agriculture, growing crops such as corn, beans, and squash. The Mohicans were organized into several clans, each with its own leaders and customs. European contact with the Mohicans began in the 1600s when Dutch traders arrived in the region. The Mohicans were initially friendly with the Dutch, but conflicts arose as other European powers began to encroach upon their territories. The Mohicans sided with the British during the American Revolution, and their traditional lands were eventually taken over by the new United States of America. Today, the Mohicans are recognized as a sovereign nation by the United States Government with their own constitution and tribal council. They are also known for their rich cultural heritage and continue to celebrate their traditions through music, dance, and other cultural activities. One of the most well-known works of literature featuring the Mohicans is James Fenimore Cooper's 1826 novel The Last of the Mohicans, which tells the story of a Mohican named Hawkeye who assists British soldiers during the French and Indian War. The novel has been adapted into several films and stage productions. Despite their struggles, the Mohicans remain a vibrant and resilient community, dedicated to preserving their heritage and traditions for future generations to enjoy and appreciate.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 63928}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Old Wave\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Old Wave is the ninth studio album by English rock musician Ringo Starr. It was originally released in June 1983, on the label Bellaphon, and is the two-year follow-up to his 1981 album Stop and Smell the Roses. The title is a play on new wave music.Background and recordingAfter John Lennon's murder in December 1980, Starr returned home to England to live at Tittenhurst Park, which Starr had purchased from Lennon in 1973. In early 1982, Starr was eager to move on to his next solo project. Deciding that he needed more consistency this time around, he would work with only one producer, Joe Walsh, a former member of the recently disbanded Eagles. Walsh and Starr had known each other since the mid-1970s, having met and befriended each other in Los Angeles. Walsh immediately agreed to work with Starr and they met at Tittenhurst in February to begin writing material. Recording began shortly afterwards and instrumental backing tracks for seven songs were recorded at Startling Studios, after Starr had previously converted Lennon's recording studio. Engineering duties were handled by Jim Nipor. These sessions were mainly done with a team consisting of Starr on drums and percussion, Walsh on guitar and backing vocals, Mo Foster on bass and both Gary Brooker and Chris Stainton on keyboards.Sessions came to a halt when Walsh and Nipor went to California on 19 March. Sessions recommenced on 6 April for a few days until 16 April. On 15 April, Rolling Stone broke the news that Starr was 'in London working on a new album with Joe Walsh acting as the producer.' Lead vocals were laid down from 19 to 23 April. Sometime in May, Starr requested permission from the Windsor and Maidenhead District Council to build a new building on his Tittenhurst Park land, which he would use for video and recording purposes. Sessions resumed from 31 May until 10 June; the next day, taking the masters recorded up to that point with him, Starr and his wife Barbara Bach flew from London to Los Angeles, and returned on 14 June. The album was finished with a third batch of sessions from 24 June into early July.'Everybody's in a Hurry But Me' came about from a jam session between the Who bassist John Entwistle, drummer and percussionist Ray Cooper and Eric Clapton. 'As Far as We Can Go' was originally recorded at Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 23 July 1978. From that original rendition, only the vocal was used. Walsh re-recorded an entirely new track utilizing one of the latest technology synthesizers.Release and aftermathThe album was originally titled It Beats Sleep. The portrait on the album cover was shot in a booth in northern England, taken before Starr had joined the Beatles. As Starr's RCA contract had been cancelled, he needed to find a new label for Old Wave. Although it was just over a decade after the Beatles' dissolution, no major UK or US record company was interested in signing him. Starr would not accept that and was determined to have Old Wave released any way he could. The album was due to be released on the Boardwalk label, but never appeared, due to the death of the label's head, Neil Bogart. RCA Canada ended up distributing the album in June 1983 in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, the Netherlands, Mexico, and Brazil; while in Germany, the album and lone single pulled from it, both released on 16 June, appeared on the Bellaphon label. The Canadian release of the album occurred on 24 June. However, Old Wave failed to achieve success in any of these territories, and would be Starr's last studio album until 1992's Time Takes Time. Two singles were pulled from the album: one in Germany, 'In My Car', backed with 'As Far as We Can Go', and the other in Mexico ('I Keep Forgettin'' b/w 'She's About a Mover').Walsh's 1987 album Got Any Gum? included a cover of 'In My Car', which was released as a single and became a moderate hit. Four tracks from the album appeared on Starr's US compilation Starr Struck: Best of Ringo Starr, Vol. 2 in 1989. The album was reissued on CD in the US by The Right Stuff on 22 August 1994, the same day as Stop and Smell the Roses (1981). A further release, on 6 September, as both CD and cassette deluxe editions, included a bonus track, the original 1978 version of 'As Far as We Can Go'. On 1 November 1994, Right Stuff re-released 'In My Car', this time on yellow vinyl, with 'She's About a Mover' as the B-side. A promotional CD was released in 1994 by Capitol, featuring three songs from both Old Wave and Stop and Smell the Roses.Track listingBonus track on the 1994 re-issuePersonnelTrack numbering refers to CD and digital releases of the album.Ringo Starr –lead vocals (all tracks), drums (1 - 4, 7, 9, 10), percussion (1 - 4, 6, 7, 10), backing vocals (10)Joe Walsh –guitar (all tracks), backing vocals (1 - 8, 10), synthesizer (8), harmonica (10)Waddy Wachtel –guitar (7, 10), harmonica (10)Eric Clapton –guitar (9)Kal David –guitar (5)Sherwood Ball –guitar (5)Chris Stainton –keyboards (1 - 4, 6, 7, 9, 10)Gary Brooker –keyboards (1 - 4, 6, 7, 10), backing vocals (10)Joe Vitale –piano (8), backing vocals (8)Bruce MacPherson – Hammond organ (5)Mo Foster – bass guitar (1 - 4, 6, 7, 8, 10), backing vocals (10)Freebo – tuba (5), bass guitar (5)John Entwistle – bass guitar (9)Kenny Edwards – bass guitar (10)Peter Bunetta – drums (5)Russ Kunkel – drums (6)Ray Cooper – percussion (6, 9)Sam Clayton – percussion (5)Joe Lala – percussion (5)Jocko Marcellino – percussion (5)David Wooford – saxophone (5)Lee Thornburg – trumpet (5)Garrett Adkins – trombone (5)Mark Easterling – backing vocals (1, 7)Steve Hess – backing vocals (1, 7)Patrick Maroshek – backing vocals (1, 7)Barbara Bach – backing vocals (10)ReferencesFootnotesCitationsExternal links1983 albums Ringo Starr albums RCA Records albums Albums produced by Joe Walsh", "machine_text": "Old Wave is a term used to describe a subset of musicians who emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s as a reaction to the burgeoning punk and new wave scenes. This term is often used in a retrospective sense, since it was never really used to describe this group of musicians at the time. The Old Wave musicians were primarily influenced by the rock and roll and rhythm and blues of the 1950s and early 1960s. They sought to create a style of music that was both nostalgic and innovative, blending the sounds of the past with the energy and attitude of the present. Some of the most prominent Old Wave musicians included Elvis Costello, Nick Lowe, Graham Parker, and Dave Edmunds. These artists were often associated with the pub rock scene in the UK, which was a precursor to punk and new wave. Although the Old Wave movement was short-lived, it had a significant impact on the music of the era, particularly in the UK. It was seen as a creative force that pushed against the boundaries of genre and style, and helped to establish a new aesthetic for the years to come. Today, the term Old Wave is often used as a catch-all phrase to describe any music from this era that doesn't fit neatly into the punk or new wave categories. It is considered an important part of the history of rock and roll, and has inspired countless musicians in the years since.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2540156}

The game was later completely cancelled.The announced features included a fully working virtual computer, random encounters, an advanced economy system, and also single and multiplayer modes in a consistent universe, or 'Multiverse'.The game takes place in the year AD 281,474,976,712,644 after people start waking up from 'deep sleep' caused by a bug in deep sleep cells that were released in 1988.is a prefix in many high-level languages used to indicate a hexidecimal literal. 10C in hexadecimal is equivalent to 1612 in decimal, which equals 281,474,976,710,656, the number of years passed in the story since 1988.Gameplay The list of features included engineering, space battles, seamless space-to-planet transitions, mining and trading, laser guns, and an open universe with both single-player and multiplayer variants.0x10c featured a working emulated 16-bit processor inside the game called the DCPU-16 that could be accessed through any of the monitors located in the game. The DCPU-16 could also load external programs and data using the required standards which would have allowed the community to make their own DCPU-16 emulators.Development In December 2011, Markus Persson announced that he was going to be stepping down as the lead developer of Minecraft, and that he would be working on another project.Mojang CEO Carl Manneh said in an interview with Edge Online that Mojang was committed to supporting a new project that Persson was developing along with another game created by other developers in their company. After winning a special award from BAFTA in March 2012, Persson revealed that there were three different projects he was developing, but he had yet to come to a decision in terms of which one he was committed to working on.A few days later in an interview with PC Gamer magazine, Persson announced that he was working on a space-themed game that was inspired by the television show Firefly and the video game Elite.The first details of this game were released in an April Fool's parody website called 'Mars Effect', a play on Mass Effect and alluding to the lawsuit by Bethesda Softworks over trademark infringement. A few days later Persson announced that he had chosen a real name for the game and that he had made some progress on its development. Although it is not immediately obvious how to pronounce the game's name and a large variety of suggestions were proposed, Persson has said that he pronounces it as 'ten to the see,' but that 'people can pronounce it however they want'.On October 13, 2012, the first video gameplay of 0x10c was released by Persson on the game's website. On October 26, 2012, the first multiplayer test was uploaded to the website from Twitch.TV. In an April 2013 interview with Polygon, Persson stated that 0x10c development was hit by creative road block and would be put on hold. Persson also said that the game is 'ways off' and that he would be expanding the team, bringing on one other developer to 'make sure the game gets made.' On August 13, 2013, Persson confirmed in a live stream that 0x10c was indefinitely shelved, adding that the game could potentially be made in the future, if another Mojang employee were interested in continuing its development.Art'The style is pixel art meets modern 3D. It's influenced by bright, vivid sci-fi, and real-world functional spaceship design to go with 0x10c”'s realistic tone,' said Jonatan Pöljö, artist of the game's team.SoundtrackOn September 15, 2014, Daniel Rosenfeld (C418), who also composed the music for Mojang's previous game, Minecraft, released the soundtrack for 0x10c on his Bandcamp page, which consists of two tracks, '0x10c' and '0'.Pricing 0x10c was expected to be the first Mojang game with a monthly fee for online play in multiplayer mode (but no recurring fee for single player mode). Persson said that this was because of the cost to 'emulate all computers and physics even when players aren't logged in.' It is unknown if there was to be a private multiplayer mode. It was revealed that the pricing would be similar to Minecraft”, with alpha costing less than beta, and beta costing less than the full release.ReferencesExternal linksOfficial website (mirror)0x10c forumCancelled Linux games Cancelled macOS games Cancelled Windows games Mojang Studios Indie video games Fiction set in the 7th millennium or beyond Multiplayer and single-player video games Multiplayer online games Programming games Science fiction video games Video games developed in Sweden", "machine_text": "0x10c was a planned space exploration and trading game developed by Markus Persson, also known as Notch, the creator of Minecraft. The game was announced in April 2012 and was expected to be released in late 2013 or early 2014. However, the development was eventually halted, and the game was never completed or released. The game's name, 0x10c, was derived from a hexadecimal number (16 in decimal) and the concept of a 'DCPU-16', or a fictional 16-bit CPU which would be the central processing unit of the game's spacecraft. The game's storyline involved the idea that in the year 281,474,976,712,644 AD, the universe suffered a catastrophic event called 'The Great Disaster'. The players' task was to navigate through this new and unfamiliar universe, explore planets, and trade with other players. One of the game's unique features was the 'real-time' nature of the game. Unlike other games where time advancements only occur in response to player actions or during cutscenes, time in 0x10c would continue to pass even when the player was not logged into the game. This means that while a player was away, their spacecraft would continue on its route, and any disasters or events that occurred during that time would be waiting for them upon their return. Unfortunately, due to the difficulties in developing the custom-designed DCPU-16 CPU and the lack of funding, the development of 0x10c was eventually stopped. Markus Persson cited a lack of motivation and interest in the project as the primary reasons for the game's cancellation. Despite the game's cancelation, the community still holds a significant level of interest in 0x10c, with some fans even attempting to create their version of the game using Notch's design documents and ideas. While 0x10c remains unfinished, its legacy continues to inspire both amateur and professional game developers in the industry.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 35474237}

The French SPAé was the executive agency for the ASAAC programme and the Prime Contract was let to Dassault Thomson Avionique Modulaire (DTAM), a GIE type organisation under French company law formed on a 50-50 basis by Dassault and Thomson. The main aeronautic and electronics companies of France, Germany, and the UK took part in the ASAAC programme as sub-contractors of the DTAM GIE. The UK and German teams were the Industrial Avionics Working Group (IAWG), comprising GEC-Marconi, British Aerospace, and Smiths Industries Aerospace and Defense Systems; and the DASA ESG ASAAC Team (DEAT), comprising Daimler-Benz Aerospace Airbus and ESG Elektroniksystem-und Logistik-GmbH. Both teams had co-prime participant status in the programme with the DTAM. The contract was let on 18 November 1997.ASAAC Phase II - Stage 1: (Nov-97 to May-99) This was purely a paper based part of the programme in which the ASAAC Standards and Concepts were defined and documented in a series of reports.ASAAC Phase II – Stage 2: (Dec-99 to Sept-03) This was the part of the programme where the concepts and standards defined in Phase II – Stage 1 were validated through a series of demonstrations using ASAAC standard software and hardware.Standard The current ASAAC standard has two parts:Def Stan 00-74: ASAAC Standards Part 1: Standards for SoftwareDef Stan 00-74: ASAAC Standards Part 2: Rationale Report for Software StandardsASAAC initially published provisional standards in five parts in January 2005:Def Stan 00-74: Proposed Standards for SoftwareDef Stan 00-75: Proposed Standards for Communications/NetworksDef Stan 00-76: Proposed Standards for Common Functional ModulesDef Stan 00-77: Proposed Standards for PackagingDef Stan 00-78: Proposed Standards for ArchitectureAll but Def Stan 00-74 were withdrawn in July 2007, the MOD and representatives from the Working group considering that it was the only standard bearing any influence.Proposed Standards for Software (Def Stan 00-74) Def Stan 00-74 is defined in the context of Integrated Modular Avionics. Software components are located on modules.Configuration and initialization: The configuration is considered asdefined in a series of blueprints describing thread and process allocation, virtual communication channels...

However, there are differences between the two standards: Some features of ASAAC API, such as file handling, thread managing inside process, or debugging, are not considered in ARINC 653.However, for the part where the two standards overlap, it is often possible to translate ASAAC interfaces in ARINC 653 API calls (and even in POSIX calls).

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"List of Mass Effect characters\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Mass Effect series, a military science fiction media franchise developed by Canadian video game developer BioWare and owned by American publisher Electronic Arts, features an extensive cast of characters. It is primarily based on a series of third-person role-playing shooter video games which currently consists of four mainline instalments and two spin-off mobile games. The first three Mass Effect games takes place in the Milky Way Galaxy during the 22nd century and revolves around a space navy soldier named Commander Shepard. The fourth Mass Effect game is a standalone sequel to the original trilogy but set in a different galaxy, Andromeda, and focuses on the Andromeda Initiative and the Ryder family. The spin-off games, Mass Effect Galaxy and Mass Effect Infiltrator, feature different protagonists.This article describes characters who appear in video games set in theMass Effect universe, which includes a diverse cast of alien, human and synthetic characters. This list describes only player characters, squad members, major antagonists, and other notable characters that appear in the games. Certain characters have names chosen by the player; these characters are designated the name they are addressed by in-game. The appearance and story arcs of certain characters in Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3 are conditional upon decisions from prior Mass Effect titles being carried over via an imported save file.Player charactersCommander ShepardCommander Shepard is the central protagonist of the original Mass Effect trilogy of video games. On an assignment to investigate a besieged human colony, Shepard is affected by a Prothean artifact that grants them insight on the Reapers, making them the key entity to help protect the species of the Milky Way from being wiped out by the Reapers. Shepard is later named the first human Spectre by the Citadel Council, and given command of the SSV Normandy and its crew to complete their mission.The character's given name, gender, background, and appearance are determined by the player on starting a new game, with both Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3 allowing the player to import saves from previous games to carry over that version of Shepard. Depending on the choice of gender, Shepard is voiced by either Mark Meer or Jennifer Hale. The default male version's face and body is based on the likeness of fashion model Mark Vanderloo.Jeff 'Joker' MoreauJeff Moreau, better known by his nickname 'Joker', is the pilot of the Normandy. Joker is a skilled pilot who has osteogenesis imperfecta. His nickname alludes to his tendency to behave as a sarcastic foil to other individuals he interact with. In Mass Effect 2, Joker briefly becomes a playable character when the Collectors invade the Normandy to capture its crew in the absence of Shepard and the squad. He can develop a romantic relationship with EDI in Mass Effect 3 if encouraged.Joker is voiced by Seth Green.Jacob Taylor Jacob Taylor is the protagonist of Mass Effect Galaxy, a tie-in iOS game to Mass Effect 2. He is a former Systems Alliance soldier who is recruited by Miranda Lawson in Galaxy to investigate a conspiracy involving batarian terrorists. Jacob is encountered in Mass Effect 2 as an official member of Cerberus and Shepard's starting squad member, as well as a potential romantic option for a female Shepard. Unless the player imports a Mass Effect 2 saved game where Jacob does not survive the suicide mission, in Mass Effect 3 he returns as a supporting character who has defected from Cerberus, and attempts to protect other Cerberus defectors from reprisals by their former employer.The iconic look of all Cerberus clothing in the series is derived from the designs for Jacob's armor and clothing; some involved fully armored looks, while others had only cloth, or a mix of cloth and armor. For airless or toxic environments, Jacob wears a small breather device, which allows for more facial expressivity. According to a former BioWare employee, Jacob was originally meant to be a bisexual romance option, and that animation work for romance scenes with Commander Shepard of both genders, 'matching shot-for-shot from Brokeback Mountain', was completed prior to intervention from management requesting that the same sex romantic content be removed, blaming backlash from news outlets like Fox News in response to the previous game.Jacob Taylor is voiced by Adam Lazarre-White.Chris Thursten from PC Gamer called Jacob 'the worst companion' and the culmination of his romance arc 'the worst moment in Mass Effect'.Randall Ezno Randall Ezno is the protagonist of Mass Effect Infiltrator, a third-person shooter tie-in video game to Mass Effect 3 developed for mobile devices. He is a cybernetically modified Cerberus operative who discovers that his employer is up to something nefarious, goes rogue and embarks on a mission to save his friend from Cerberus.Randall is voiced by Jay Anthony Franke.Pathfinder Ryder Pathfinder Ryder is the main protagonist of Mass Effect: Andromeda, the fourth mainline installment of the Mass Effect series, and the child of Alec Ryder. Their twin sibling is Sara or Scott Ryder, depending on the player's chosen gender. The player can change their character's first name, but if the default names of Sara or Scott are kept, NPCs will occasionally refer to the character's first name in voiced dialogue.The Ryder siblings are cryogenically frozen and dispatched alongside their father and tens of thousands of other colonists on a 600-year journey to the Andromeda galaxy, departing before the events of Mass Effect 3. The ark carrying the humans, the Hyperion, arrives at the wrong drop point, far from the forward command centre of the Andromeda Initiative, the Nexus, and cut off from contact with both it and the other arks. The player-controlled Ryder later succeeds their father as the Hyperion's Pathfinder, and is tasked with leading their crew on the command ship The Tempest, successfully settling the Heleus Cluster, and improving life aboard the Nexus, a galactic hub for the colonizer races from the Milky Way.Scott and Sara Ryder are voiced by Tom Taylorson and Fryda Wolff, respectively.Andromeda was known for its technical issues, particularly for the awkward facial animations of some of its characters; notably, the default face for Sara Ryder received negative reception from fans prior toand after the game's launch, attracting comments such as 'It's a perfect representation of the uncanny valley' and a 'robot-like model that had dead eyes syndrome' prior to a patch fix released in early April 2017.Squad membersOriginal trilogyKaidan AlenkoKaidan Alenko is a human Alliance Navy officer with biotic powers, who serves aboard the SSV Normandy as Staff Lieutenant and head of the ship's Marine detail. In a late-game choice on the planet Virmire, the player must choose whether to save Ashley Williams or Kaidan; this choice leads to the other character's death. If Kaidan survives, he returns in a cameo in Mass Effect 2 and as a full squad member in 3, where he has been promoted to the rank of Major and commands the 1st Special Operations Biotic Company, a covert operations unit. He is later bestowed Spectre status by the council. He is a potential romance option for a female Shepard throughout the entire trilogy, and for a male Shepard only in Mass Effect 3.Kaidan is voiced by Raphael Sbarge.Ashley WilliamsAshley Williams is a human Alliance Marine, who becomes part of Shepard's squad during the first observed Reaper attack in the first Mass Effect. In a late-game choice on the planet Virmire, the player must choose whether to save Ashley or Kaidan Alenko; this choice leads to the other character's death. If Ashley is saved, she will return in a cameo appearance in Mass Effect 2 and as a member of Shepard's squad for Mass Effect 3, where she has attained the rank of Lieutenant Commander and commands an unspecified covert operations unit. She is later bestowed Spectre status by the council. She is a potential romance option for a male Shepard throughout the original trilogy.Ashley Williams is voiced by Kimberly Brooks.Garrus VakarianGarrus Vakarian is a male turian who serves as a squad mate in all three of the games. Garrus is initially a C-Sec officer who joins up with Shepard to escape from all the 'red tape' in his job but becomes a vigilante under the alias Archangel on Omega in Mass Effect 2 before his squad is killed. Garrus is a potential romance option for a female Shepard in 2.In Mass Effect 3, he leads a 'Reaper task force' for the Turians, with the option to continue their relationship from 2 if he was Shepard's paramour. The character is also the star of the third issue of Mass Effect: Homeworlds. Garrus's blue-and-black armour colour scheme was kept consistent throughout the series, as was his visor, although grey was added in the third game to reflect his new rank.Garrus is voiced by Brandon Keener.Urdnot WrexA famous bounty hunter and mercenary, Wrex is among the last of the Krogan Battle Masters. They are rare individuals who can combine biotic abilities with advanced weaponry and tactics. He joins the crew of the SSV Normandy in the first Mass Effect to hunt the rogue Spectre Saren, but is later drawn into a stand-off with Commander Shepard in Virmire when he discovers that Saren's scientists have uncovered a cure for the genophage. Depending on the outcome, he may return in later sequels and eventually become a leader of the krogan.Wrex is voiced by Steven Barr.Tali'ZorahTali'Zorah, initially known by her full name Tali'Zorah nar Rayya, is the first quarian character to appear in the series. She is a squad mate in each of the three games. While she is known as a genius in the field of mechanical engineering. as the daughter of Admiral Rael'Zorah there is much pressure for Tali to excel. In the first game, she is on her Pilgrimage, before handing Shepard incriminating evidence about Saren and joining their crew. In the second game, now Tali'Zorah Vas Neema, where she joins Shepard on a suicide mission to rescue human colonists from the Collectors, and she is a potential romance option for a male Shepard. If she survives the suicide mission, she will appear as a squad member in Mass Effect 3, with the option to continue their relationship from 2 if she was Shepard's paramour. If Shepard sides with the geth over the quarians during the latter's attempt to retake Rannoch, she will commit suicide after witnessing the annihilation of the quarian Migrant Fleet.Tali is voiced by Ash Sroka, also credited as 'Liz Sroka'.Liara T'SoniLiara T'Soni is an asari scientist, that joins Shepard's squad in the first game and appears in 2 as a non-player character (available as a temporary squad member in Mass Effect 2: Lair of the Shadow Broker) and as a full squad member in 3. She is one of the experts on Prothean history and technology. Liara is a potential romance option for Shepard throughout the entire trilogy. Following Shepard's death in Mass Effect 2, Liara gradually became emotionally hardened, and began working as an information broker, eventually leading to the events of Lair of the Shadow Broker which conclude with her becoming the new Shadow Broker.Liara is voiced by Ali Hillis.Miranda LawsonMiranda Lawson is an officer of the pro-human group Cerberus, first appearing in Mass Effect Galaxy and then serving as a squad mate in Mass Effect 2. In addition to these, the character also makes an appearance in the Mass Effect: Redemption comic series and in Mass Effect 3 (provided the player does not import a save where she dies). She is revealed to have been genetically designed by her father to be perfect and ran away from home to join Cerberus. Lawson is leader of Cerberus' Lazarus Cell, tasked with reviving Commander Shepard. Aboard the Normandy SR-2, she is Shepard's second-in-command and Executive Officer, and files mission reports directly to the Illusive Man.Miranda Lawson is voiced by and modeled after actress Yvonne Strahovski.EDIEDI is an AI entity who first appears in Mass Effect 2 as the Normandy SR-2's artificial intelligence and speaks with an aurally feminine voice. Her name stands for 'Enhanced Defense Intelligence', and is visually represented on the Normandy by a holographic blue sphere. For Mass Effect 3, the developers wanted to give EDI a body that is 'sexy, chrome, and robotic', akin to the Maria character, also known as the Maschinenmensch, from Metropolis. EDI's facial and body design went through multiple iterations, which includes an eyeless visage, and partially completed 3-D models which differ from the EDI's appearance in terms of body shape, the split between solid and transparent surfaces, and finer points of her two-tone appearance. After some discussion about how robotic would the extent of her appearance be, the team decided that the body she would come to possess is an infiltration unit, which once had skin over its metal frame and is capable of the same facial effects as a living human being to avoid being easily spotted.Mass Effect 2 establishes that EDI's highly advanced nature is a result of modifications achieved with technology salvaged from the Reaper Sovereign. She is initially 'shackled' with programming which inhibits her decision making, until it was later removed by Joker. In Mass Effect 3, Shepard's team recovers a Cerberus infiltration unit named Eva to be analyzed after an incident at the Mars research station. EDI assists in doing so, and in the process, struggles with the synthetic entity and eventually seizes control of its platform in the process, allowing her to accompany Shepard as a squad mate on missions. Now possessing a physical body with humanlike characteristics, her relationship with Joker develops further, and, if Shepard supports the idea, the two may start a romantic relationship. She often asks Shepard about the context and nature of human behaviour so that she can better understand human psychology and, in a sense, taking on more human traits herself. During the Alliance raid on Cerberus Headquarters, a Cerberus report discovered in the base retroactively establishes EDI's original identity as a rogue VI which somehow achieved sentience and took over an Alliance training ground located on Earth's moon during an optional mission of the first Mass Effect game. If Shepard chooses to control the Reapers or the synthesis of all organic and synthetic life at the conclusion of the game, EDI will be present in the ending cutscene alongside Joker.EDI is voiced by Tricia Helfer.PC Gamer praised EDI's characterization, noting that she 'might have had some fine dialogue and ruminations on what it means to be human'. EDI is also included in PC Gamer's definitive list of the best squad mates around, citing her utility as a solid fighter and being an actual spaceship. GameRevolution included EDI in their list of 'Women Who Rock Modern Gaming'; praise was focused on her unique contribution to the squad dynamic in Mass Effect 3 with her new body, her inexperience in interacting with humanity which often leads to humorous situations, as well as her integration into the game's main plot during the final act of the game. On the other hand, Wes Fenlon indicated in his articles written for PC Gamer and Gamesradar that he was disturbed by BioWare's decision to give EDI a sexy robot body, and involving the character in a romance subplot with Joker. Stacey Henley from TheGamer also disapproved of EDI's costume design in Mass Effect 3, and criticized the sexualization of the character's physical appearance as not only unnecessary, but also uncomfortable as it detracts from her role in Mass Effect 3s team dynamic, as well as her 'brilliant' characterization which Henley summarized as 'engaging, philosophical, layered'.Mordin SolusMordin Solus is a salarian scientist who possesses a hyperactive and eccentric personality, a rapid and stilted manner of speaking, anda flawless autobiographical and eidetic memory which is a typical salarians trait. He is a key member in the science team that researched the remodification of the Krogan Genophage, an action that he initially considered the best possible solution to a once growing problem, as he believes in acting in the best interests of the galaxy.The character returns in Mass Effect 3, providing he survives the suicide mission in Mass Effect 2; otherwise, another salarian scientist named Padok Wiks fulfills Mordin's role within the narrative. Mordin is encountered on the salarian homeworld, Sur'Kesh, when Shepard is sent there to aid in the evacuation of a fertile female krogan codenamed Eve, the only survivor of his student Maelon's experiments. If Maelon's research data was saved in the previous game, he uses it to aid in Eve's treatment and produce a viable cure for the Genophage.Mordin Solus is voiced by Michael Beattie in Mass Effect 2, and by William Salyers in Mass Effect 3.JackJack, also known as Jacqueline Nought or 'Subject Zero', is the powerful product of unethical Cerberus experiments to enhance human biotic ability, which molded her antisocial temperament. Shepard may recruit Jack from the prison facility that she is confined in to join the suicide mission against the Collectors, in exchange for files aboard the Normandy about the science facility where Cerberus scientists tortured and abused her. She is a potential romance option for a male Shepard in Mass Effect 2. Jack reappears in Mass Effect 3 if a save game is imported where she survives the events of the suicide mission, with the option to continue their relationship from 2 if she was Shepard's paramour.Jack is voiced by Courtenay Taylor.Grunt Grunt is a tank-bred genetically engineered super-krogan that can be recruited as a squad member. Grunt's design is intended to be youthful but also tough, invoking the look of a linebacker with large shoulder pads and exposed muscular arms. Compared to Wrex who is a much older krogan, Grunt's crest is smaller and does not fully cover his entire skull due to his age. Early designs for Grunt's armor varied widely, which eventually settled into a polished and sleek look, almost like a 'show-room finish' on a brand new car. A confrontation scene in Mass Effect 2 between Grunt and Mordin over the latter's role in strengthening the Genophage was planned but ultimately cut during development.Initially in Mass Effect 2, Shepard is meant to recruit Okeer, a krogan warlord and radical scientist who has been developing a small army of krogan to weather the Genophage. When Shepard arrives to recruit him, Okeer is working for the Blue Suns mercenary group, but was betrayed by the latter. Though Shepard and crew defeat the Blue Suns leader, it is too late to save Okeer, who leaves Shepard with a tank containing his 'legacy', his 'perfect krogan'. If and when Shepard decides to awaken him, the krogan recalls Okeer's last words and chooses one of them, 'grunt', as his name. While initially hostile towards Shepard, Grunt may be recruited as a squad mate. He comes to respect Shepard's leadership, partly because Shepard faces great battles and has powerful enemies. If Grunt becomes loyal, he declares Shepard his battlemaster. If the player imports a save game where Grunt survives the suicide mission in 2, he appears in Mass Effect 3 in a small role.Grunt is voiced by Steve Blum.Grunt showing Shepard his strength in Mass Effect 2 is considered to be one of the original trilogy's most iconic moments by Kotaku's Gergo Vas.PC Gamer staff noted that while there is not much to the character 'beyond punching things and talking about fighting', dealing with Grunt could be a 'refreshing change from the philosophizing and soul-searching of the rest of the crew.'Thane KriosThane is a mysterious drell assassin who is terminally ill from a disease known as Kepral's Syndrome, which is exclusive to drell due to their physiology. While a coldblooded killer, Thane possesses a conscience that struggles against his own profession. Shepard may recruit him on the asari-dominated world of Ilium for the suicide mission in Mass Effect 2. At the time of his recruitment, Thane states he has nothing left to lose, and he hopes to right many wrongs he has found in the galaxy before his death. Thane Krios is a possible romantic interest for a female Shepard.Thane returns in Mass Effect 3 provided he survived the suicide mission in Mass Effect 2. Thane may play a role in the narrative depending on the player's prior decisions, but will ultimately succumb to his wounds from Kai Leng if he plays a role in preventing the assassination of a Citadel councilor, or to Kepral's Syndrome.Thane Krios is voiced by Keythe Farley.SamaraSamara is an Asari Justicar, a member of a highly respected and feared ascetic order of mystic warriors. Samara is on a quest to track down her fugitive daughter Morinth, who is a biological deviant known as an Ardat-Yakshi. Shepard meets Samara on Illium, where she is found investigating the Eclipse mercenary group who smuggled her daughter off-world. Samara will join Shepard for the suicide mission at the conclusion of the investigation; if Shepard chooses to participate in her quest, a decision has to be made between siding with Samara or Morinth at the climax of the story arc. If the player imports a save game where Samara survives the events of Mass Effect 2, she returns in a small role in Mass Effect 3 where she is encountered by Shepard at an Ardat-Yakshi monastery; confronted by a duty to comply with the Justicar Code by executing her only living child, who is also Ardat-Yakshi like Morinth and forbidden from leaving an asari monastery, she will attempt to commit suicide unless Shepard stops her.Samara is voiced by Maggie Baird, while Rana McAnear provides her likeness.Morinth Morinth is the fugitive daughter of Samara. She is an Ardat-Yakshi, asari who are born with an inherited trait which kills their mates during sexual encounters by burning out their nervous systems. Morinth joins Shepard's squad in Mass Effect 2 if she is assisted with trapping and killing Samara. She will then disguise herself as her mother and takes up residence at Samara's quarters on board The Normandy, so that only Shepard knows of Samara's death. Shepard may choose to mate with Morinth, although it will result in his or her death. If the player imports a save game where Morinth is recruited and survives the events of Mass Effect 2, she will appear in Mass Effect 3 as an indoctrinated husk-like enemy type known as a banshee.Morinth is voiced by Natalia Cigliuti. Her face was modeled after Rana McAnear. Morinth originally had a different face and character model and could not pass as Samara, and that Shepard would have had to either disclose the truth about Samara's fate to the rest of the crew or lie to them. Unlike most other squadmates in Mass Effect who had more complete arcs, Morinth only has two full-fledged conversations with Shepard, which mainly deals with her backstory with Samara and her experiences growing up as an Ardat-Yakshi. Morinth's planned dialogue options were trimmed down due to scope reasons and time constraints encountered during development, and the team opted to give the character an appearance which is identical to Samara, instead of cutting her from the game completely.Video game developer Brian Kindregan, who wrote Morinth for Mass Effect 2, described her as a free spirit, a character who decides her own destiny and flaunt society's rules even if others are harmed in the process. To explore the dark underside of sapient or sentient beings that Morinth is drawn to, the decision was made to shift her original role from the leader of an underground cult to a hedonistic sexual predator who prowls for victims at a nightclub on Omega space station. Inspired by nightclub scenes depicted in Blade and The Matrix, Kindregan wanted to convey the feeling of an 'alternative culture just underneath the surface of one, and one that represents hedonism but also a slightly scary, predatory feel.' Kindregan emphasized that the mission was not intended to be social commentary on drugs and nightclubs, but rather the underlying concepts they represent in fiction, as nightclubs in his view represent 'unbridled human impulse and desire' and material excess by privileged youth similar in spirit to the symbolism presented by the depiction of jungles and wild nature in Heart of Darkness.'Unlike most other levels in Mass Effect 2, Morinth's nightclub scene does not involve any combat sequences; instead, it entirely revolves around a story-driven gameplay mechanic Kindregan called a 'puzzle conversation'. Kindregan said it is difficult to write and implement a puzzle conversation as the player is supposed to be able to intuit the correct answers by interpreting Morinth's facial expressions and body language, and that he had considered incorporating a 'safety valve' at the beginning of the mission for the benefit for the player, which would have served as a foolproof way to acquire all the correct answers to the conversation and complete the mission. Kindregan credited the positive feedback for the mission to the success of the final product's narrative and design as well as his teamwork with senior level senior level designer Dusty Evermore.PC Gamer staff considers Morinth to be a poor replacement for her mother, 'the more interesting and conflicted justicar'. She is rated better as an antagonist instead, the 'cat-and-mouse game of catching Morinth' being lauded as one of Mass Effect 2's most exciting moments. András Neltz from Kotaku commented that 'the sheer audacity of a scam this huge—setting out to recruit a virtuous Asari Justicar, and coming back with her black widow of a daughter instead, passing her off as the real thing—is truly amazing.'LegionLegion is the name, inspired by the 'Gospel of Mark 5:9 – Exorcism of the Gerasene demoniac', given to the gestalt intelligence hosted within a geth mobile unit eleven times more powerful than standard geth mobile platforms. Legion belongs to the true Geth Consensus, and is designed to operate outside of geth space and interact diplomatically with organic lifeforms. In contrast to other Geth, Legion is capable of independent thought, and demonstrates emotional attachment as they are particularly fascinated with Shepard.Legion is voiced by D. C. Douglas.Zaeed MassaniZaeed is a human bounty hunter who is integrated into Mass Effect 2 through the DLC pack Zaeed - The Price of Revenge and later as part of the Mass Effect Legendary Edition compilation. He holds the reputation as the galaxy's most feared bounty hunter and co-founder of the Blue Suns mercenary group. Unlike most other characters, Zaeed joins Shepard's squad as soon as he is spoken to, and only tells short stories when conversed with. For his loyalty mission, he asks that Shepard help his vendetta against the Blue Suns' other co-founder, Vido Santiago. If the player imports a save game where Zaeed survives the events of 2, Zaeed returns in Mass Effect 3 with a small role.Originally cut from the base game due to budget and time constraints, the Zaeed - The Price of Revenge DLC allowed the character's writer Jay Turner to repurpose unused content and use the constraints as a core part of his character. As Zaeed's loyalty mission is the only opportunity for players to get to know him, Turner had to ensure that all aspects of the character, 'from his dialogue to the identity of the villain to the events along the way' must speak to his personality and backstory. To establish a simple but compelling motive for him, Turner pitched Zaeed's loyalty mission as one based on revenge, with his personality shaped into that of a grizzled survivor who has endured all kinds of death-defying situations with the stories and scars to prove it. Turner intended Zaeed to be an exploration of the themes of PTSD and trauma, and also as a ruthless antithesis to the 'BioWare Paladin' archetype who is willing to complete his mission at all costs. Zaeed initially had a mechanic leg and a dog companion during early concept stages. Head models for the character went through various iterations, which included scarring, tattoos with the Blue Suns insignia, and potential breathers inspired by hocket masks and welding helmets for intimidation purposes.Zaeed is voiced by Robin Sachs.PC Gamer staff member Wes Fenlon calling Zaeed a 'less interesting retread of KotOR's Mandalorian Canderous Ordo' and expressed doubt about his ineffectiveness as a squad mate.Kasumi GotoKasumi is a human master thief who is integrated into Mass Effect 2 through the DLC pack, Kasumi – Stolen Memory and later as part of the Mass Effect Legendary Edition compilation. The character's core concept is “the best thief in the galaxy”. Unlike other characters, Kasumi does not have a recruitment mission and joins Shepard's squad as soon as she is spoken to, only making brief remarks or observations when interacted with. For her loyalty mission, Kasumi requests Shepard's help in retrieving the memory box of her dead lover Keiji Okuda. Kasumi returns in Mass Effect 3 with a small role, provided a save game is imported where her eponymous DLC was played and she survives the suicide mission.Originally cut from the base game, Kasumi allowed the character's writer Jay Turner the chance to provide a 'glimpse into a wild underground where there are art heists and Bond villains and respect among thieves' in Mass Effect 2. Turner wrote Kasumi's personality to be 'irreverent and quirky and confident', with the intention to position her as Shepard's 'best friend' as opposed to being yet another female character who Shepard could romance or sleep with. Describing Kasumi as his favorite character, Turner thought of her as a cheerful change from the game's often serious and severe tone. Kasumi presented Turner with an opportunity to explore the series' tropes from a different angle as she comments on Shepard's world from the perspective of an outsider who is a master of her world, one which is unfamiliar to Shepard. Turner compared her to the Batman character, in that she is always prepared and composed for any given situation, in spite of her flighty or flippant demeanor. Kasumi's visual design drew inspiration from Middle Eastern culture; her outfit echoes that of a typical thief from the European Middle Ages, the hood in particular gives her a mysterious and stealthy look.Kasumi Goto is voiced by Kym Hoy. Hoy noted that Kasumi's cultural background is specifically stated to be of Japanese descent, and that the casting call required a candidate who could carry the mystique of an elusive personality along with projecting a vaguely Asian-sounding accent. With the guidance of her voiceover directors, Hoy made necessary preparations to develop a blend of Japanese and British English accents for Kasumi's soft-spoken voice; as she wanted a little mystery surrounding where Kasumi is truly from, she was mindful about not making the accent overly modern-sounding and not too precise. Hoy credits her past experience in performing ethnic Asian characters as well as her classical theatre and singing training for her ability to perform Kasumi's accent at a consistent pace, and ensuring the character sounds natural in terms of timing and delivery without it becoming a caricature. Hoy noted that while BioWare had specifications about how they wanted the character to sound like, with '1940s movie star sass' being an ideal, they were also open to feedback and questions from her about the development of the character's personality.PC Gamer staff praised Kasumi as one of more visually interesting Mass Effect squad mates. IGN's Steven Hopper ranked Kasumi #9 in his list of best Mass Effect teammates.James VegaLieutenant James Vega is a human Systems Alliance Marine and Shepard's squad member in Mass Effect 3. James is tasked to escort Shepard to an Alliance defense committee hearing, however the hearing is interrupted when the Reapers attack Earth. James and Ashley or Kaidan, depending on who survived Virmire, retrieve the Normandy SR-2 and pick Shepard up from Earth. James is the main focus of theanime film, Mass Effect: Paragon Lost.James Vega is voiced by Freddie Prinze, Jr. in all media.Javik Javik is the endling of the Prothean race, and is only available if the Mass Effect 3: From Ashes DLC is installed. His stasis pod is uncovered and opened by Commander Shepard and Liara T'Soni during his recruitment mission, who were investigating Cerberus activity on the human colony of Eden Prime. Flashbacks of Javik's memories happen during the mission which reveals insights on the Prothean's struggle against the Reapers. Javik reacted with shock that he had awaken after 50,000 years and everything he knew was gone, but agrees to join Shepard to stop the Reapers no matter the cost.The Protheans were first depicted in the form of visually ambiguous statues on the planet Ilos in the first game, as at the time BioWare was unsure as to the extent of the role the Protheans would play over the course of the original trilogy. Javik's final design is based on the look of the Collectors from Mass Effect 2, particularly the shell shape of the head which is a signature feature of the Collectors, along with multiple pupils to the eyes and secondary nostrils to evoke a very alien feel. As the Protheans of his time were known for their highly advanced technological capabilities, Javik is intended to look more intelligent than a mindless Collector drone. Javik's armor, which is influenced by the aesthetics of samurai armor, is intended to be technologically advanced yet with an ancient feel, thematically appropriate for a being who had been placed in stasis for over 50,000 years.Javik is voiced by Ike Amadi.Mass Effect: AndromedaCora Harper Cora Harper is a human biotic commando and operations specialist in charge of the Pathfinder team's ground missions. She began a career in the Alliance military, before serving with an asari commando unit as part of a Council inter-species integration scheme. She is second-in-command of the human Pathfinder team and meant to be Alec Ryder's appointed successor as Pathfinder. Cora is a romance option for a male Pathfinder.Cora is voiced by Jules de Jongh.Liam Kosta Liam Kosta is a human security and crisis response specialist for the Pathfinder team, and was “hand-picked” by Alec Ryder due to his multidisciplinary skills. Liam is a romance option for a female Pathfinder.Liam is voiced by Gary Carr.Vetra Nyx Vetra Nyx is from the turian homeworld of Palaven and a well traveled drifter, who at some point 'drifted into the wrong crowd'. She has well honed street smarts and adaptability from years of working with smugglers and mercenaries, and is fiercely loyal once her trust is earned. Vetra is a romance option for a Pathfinder of either gender.Vetra is voiced by Danielle Rayne.Pelessaria 'Peebee' B'Sayle Pelessaria B'Sayle, better known by her nickname Peebee is a rogue-ish young academic from Port Lerama, capital of the planet Hyetiana, a hub for asari science and education. She has developed an obsessive interest in studying the Remnant, an umbrella term coined for technology, structures, and autonomous bots that have been sighted across the Heleus Cluster. She is considered to be an atypical member of asari culture, “pathologically independent”, and has little regard for rules or teamwork. She is rivals with Kalinda, another asari who competes with Peebee in her search for Remnant technology. Peebee is a romance option for a Pathfinder of either gender.Peebee is voiced by Christine Lakin.Nakmor Drack Nakmor Drack is a veteran krogan warrior who has well over 1,400 years of life experience as a soldier, mercenary, and occasional pirate in the Milky Way galaxy. He is vocal about the genophage and the Citadel community's treatment of his species. Unlike other members of the Nakmor clan, he is loyal to the Nexus, the seat of government and power for the Andromeda Initiative, and to his granddaughter, Nakmor Kesh. Drack's preferred weapon is a 'Ruzad' shotgun, and his favorite ability is Blood Rage, which 'enhances his melee damage, damage resistance, and health regeneration'.Drack is voiced by Stanley Townsend.Jaal Ama Darav Jaal Ama Darav is a high-ranking member of the Angaran Resistance who are at war with the kett, and joins the Pathfinder's team as a liaison between the Andromeda Initiative and the resistance fighters. Jaal's preferred weapon is a sniper rifle. Jaal was initially a romance option for a female player character only, and was an early fan favorite among Andromeda's new cast of characters. A patchfor the game released in June 2017 made Jaal available as a potential romance option for a male player character.Jaal is voiced by Nyasha Hatendi.Major antagonistsThe ReapersThe Reapers are a highly advanced machine race of synthetic-organic starships residing in dark space: the vast, mostly starless space between galaxies. They hibernate and remain dormant for a cycle of fifty thousand years, before returning to the Milky Way galaxy and harvest all sentient organic life. The Reapers and their various agents are the overarching antagonists of the original trilogy.Saren Arterius Saren Arterius is a turian Spectre, an elite operative who represented the Citadel Council and operated above the law, and one of the two main antagonists of the first Mass Effect game . Saren was originally designed as an older, weaker character who is a powerful biotic. Saren's head design went through several iterations: the team experimented with structure, scarring, and decorations. His final appearance is similar to other turians but with a distinctive crest, and a lack of tattoos unlike most of his kind. It was intended for the character to show signs of severe indoctrination, yet does not look like an obvious monstrosity and is still able to blend into society. The character's final design incorporates a mechanical arm and some visible cybernetic features to reflect Reaper indoctrination.He first appears in the novel Mass Effect: Revelation, which takes place 18 years before to the events of Mass Effect and before he was indoctrinated and working with Sovereign. Saren later takes command of a dissident geth faction through the use of a Reaper known as Sovereign. With a machine army at his command, he uses them to both do his bidding and oppose Shepard across the story of the Mass Effect video game. Saren's main base is situated on the planet Virmire, where he is conducting experiments such as a cure for the Krogan Genophage to bolster his army. Throughout the course of the game, the Reaper slowly began to manipulate Saren through subtle subliminal messages into helping it bring back the Reapers. During the geth invasion of the Citadel, Saren uses the Prothean Conduit to gain access to the Citadel to allow Sovereign to activate the Citadel mass relay. The player can then either attempt to kill Saren or appeal to Saren to fight his indoctrination, which if successful will prompt him to commit suicide. Shepard later has to fight a revived and mutated Saren, who is possessed by Sovereign through his grafted cybernetics. Upon defeat of the Sovereign-manipulated Saren, Sovereign itself loses its defenses and is destroyed.IGN included the moment Saren commits suicide in their list of 13 Best Mass Effect Moments.Saren is voiced by Fred Tatasciore.Matriarch Benezia Matriarch Benezia is the mother of Liara T'Soni, and was a highly regarded spiritual leader among the asari until she was mind controlled by the Reaper Sovereign and forced to become Saren's second in command. Her appearance is intended to capture the beauty and mystical power of the asari, and also to associate her with Saren's malevolence through its darker and more enigmatic qualities. The design of her headdress references religious and royal clothing.In Mass Effect Shepard travels to the planet Noveria and confronts Benezia, discovering that she has found and captured a surviving queen of the rachni. Benezia intends to use the rachni queen to breed an army of rachni to fight Saren's enemies. Although Benezia has a lucid moment during their fight, where she reveals the next phase of Saren's plans and warns Shepard about Sovereign's corrupting influence, Shepard has to fight her to the death after she completely succumbs to the indoctrination.Matriarch Benezia is voiced by Marina Sirtis.Donnel Udina Donnel Udina first appears in the original Mass Effect as the human ambassador based in the Citadel. Udina is depicted as self-serving politician who has an antagonistic relationship with Shepard and their mentor David Anderson throughout the original trilogy. By the events of Mass Effect 3, he is the representative for humanity in the Citadel Council, regardless of the player's choice in the ending of the first game. Later in 3, Udina allies with Cerberus to stage a coup in a desperate attempt to overthrow his fellow Councillors as part of his plan to prioritize the liberation of planet Earth from the Reapers, but he is killed when the coup fails.Donnell Udina is voiced by Bill Ratner.The Thorian The Thorian, also called Species 37, is an ancient sentient fungal creature tens of thousands of years old, with unique mind-controlling and telepathic abilities, the ability to create clone duplicates of a being it has absorbed, and a massive sensory network stretching over the surface of the planet Feros. It releases spores into the air that infect those who inhale them, and uses pain to control the behavior of its thralls. In Mass Effect, the Thorian encounters Shiala, an asari and former acolyte of Matriarch Benezia who had been absorbed by the Thorian, which used clone duplicates of her as an avatar to interact with Shepard's team. Shiala will be set free after the Thorian is killed, and she grants Shepard the Prothean cipher which enables the mental decryption of the mental message transmitted from the Prothean beacon. Shepard has the choice to either spare or execute her.CerberusCerberus, an anthropocentric group advocating militarism and a 'humanity-first' supremacist agenda, appears as recurring antagonists in the series. Cerberus is founded and led by the Illusive Man, voiced by Martin Sheen. Cerberus forms an alliance with Commander Shepard against the human-abducting Collectors in Mass Effect 2, whereas in Mass Effect 3 they work against Shepard's attempts to destroy the Reapers, as the Illusive Man wishes to control them instead. The organization experienced numerous defections between the events of Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3, including operatives who specialize in close combat electric whips.Megan Logan from Inverse praised the depiction of Cerberus in the series as a villainous entity, and opined that 'nuanced complexity built upon an understandable motivation is what makes a compelling antagonist'.Kai Leng Kai Leng is a former lieutenant N7 marine and Cerberus assassin, who first appears in the novel Mass Effect: Retribution, as well as its subsequent sequels. Kai Leng is the Illusive Man's most trusted agent, who used him as his best infiltration and wet-work operative for over a decade, and appears in Mass Effect 3 as one of the game's main antagonists. He wears a coat similar to Thane's over a uniform with Cerberus colors, and his face and body is equipped with visible cybernetic implants to compensate for the injuries he sustained in Retribution courtesy of David Anderson. Early direction of Kai Leng's concept involve inhuman-looking metallic legs and hard armor as upgrades, which were streamlined during the later period of the development cycle of 3 into a stealthier appearance along with his hairstyle, coat length and visor type.In Mass Effect 3 he was among the forces deployed during Udina's coup on the Citadel Council, and will succeed in assassinating the salarian councilor unless Thane Krios or Kirrahe are available in Mass Effect 3 to intervene. Kai Leng is next encountered on the asari homeworld Thessia, where he successfully claims an ancient Prothean-made VI from the asari on the Illusive Man's orders. Shepard's final encounter with Kai Leng is in the Illusive Man's observation deck on Cronos Station, the Cerberus headquarters. Despite his lethal skills, he is unable to overwhelm Shepard, and is wounded. He later retrieves his blade and makes a final attempt to kill the Commander from behind. At that moment, Shepard detects him and counters his attack, finishing him off with an omni-blade.Kai Leng is voiced by Troy Baker.Kai Leng's execution by Shepard is considered to be one of the original trilogy's most iconic moments by Kotaku's Gergo Vas, and one of the 13 best Mass Effect Moments by IGN.Oleg Petrovsky Oleg Petrovsky is a general of Cerberus' armed forces, who first appears in the comic Mass Effect: Invasion, where he seizes control of the Omega space station from Aria T'Loak using adjutants, a type of husk-like creature engineered by Cerberus through co-opting Reaper technology. He makes his first video game appearance as the main antagonist of the Mass Effect 3 DLC Omega.The Collectors The Collectors are mysterious aliens first mentioned in the 2008 novel Mass Effect: Ascension, who are known to trade hyper-advanced technology in exchange for living beings from various species. They were widely dismissed as myths within the Mass Effect universe, but are in fact the deformed versions of the original Prothean race. Prior to the events of Mass Effect 2, all known expeditions to investigate the Collectors failed, and no vessel that ventured to their space beyond Omega 4 Relay ever returned save those of the Collectors themselves. Led by a Collector General, a unique being who controls the rest of the Collectors from their base beyond the Omega Four mass relay, they collect humans by incapacitating them using flying insect-like 'seeker swarms' to create a new Reaper on their masters' behest following Sovereign's defeat and destruction at the end of the first game. The Collectors are assisted by a variety of husk units made from Reaper technology, with some created from multiple husks strung together in a grotesque manner such as Scions who provide ranged fire support with their arm cannons, as well as large floating monstrosities called Praetorians. The Collectors' look is based on crabs and microscopic closeups of insect species like beetles and mosquitoes. The Collectors were initially envisioned as robed walking bipedal aliens for a dark, cultlike feel; as Collector soldier units had to fulfill in-game combat mechanic requirements, their design shifted to a more humanoid appearance, while the Collector General has multiple limbs that resemble arthropod legs.András Neltz from Kotaku consider the Collectors to be tragic figures, and 'a demonstration of what evil the Reapers are capable of; a twisted shadow of a once-proud race, forced to serve the ones who destroyed them.'The Shadow Broker The Shadow Broker is the elusive and enigmatic head of an expansive organization which trades in data and information, always selling to the highest bidder. The Shadow Broker's identity is unknown to the general public and always operates through an agent. For the Shadow Broker's design, two disparate concepts were combined: that of the galaxy's greatest information broker whose suit evokes a mob boss look and is fully integrated into the galactic community, as well as that of an unfamiliar alien and a frighteningly inhuman challenge for Shepard. The Broker's final facial design, with his triangular mouth and multiple eyes, is unlike anything BioWare has done in the past, and custom work had to be done to animate his face properly as Mass Effect 2 digital-acting system could not handle the graphical stress.In Mass Effect Tali wanted to trade evidence incriminating Saren to the Shadow Broker in exchange for a safe place to hide; the Broker sends a thug named Fist to deal with her, although he later dispatches Wrex to eliminate Fist, who had turned traitor. Other notable agents of the Broker include the volus financial adviser Barla Von, and Wilson, Miranda Lawson's assistant in the Lazarus Project who joins Shepard as a temporary squad mate on Lazarus Station in Mass Effect 2. Following the events of Mass Effect: Redemption, Liara pursues the Shadow Broker for revenge over her friend Feron's imprisonment and torture. In Mass Effect 2: Lair of the Shadow Broker, Liara survives an assassination attempt by an agent of the Broker, a rogue asari Spectre named Tela Vasir. She then travels to the Shadow Broker Base on the planet Hagalaz with Shepard, where they confront the Shadow Broker, who is revealed to be a member of a pre-spaceflight race called the yahg. They killed the Broker following a boss fight, and Liara succeeds him as the new Shadow Broker.Shepard's meeting and confrontation with the Shadow Broker is considered to be one of the original trilogy's most iconic moments by Kotaku's Gergo Vas, and one of the 13 best Mass Effect Moments by IGN.Dr. Amanda Kenson Dr. Amanda Kenson is a human scientist known for her groundbreaking discoveries on the origins of the mass relays. She appears as a deep cover agent in the Mass Effect 2 DLC Arrival, and is saved from batarian captivity by Shepard on her friend Admiral Hackett's behest. She claims to have found evidence of an imminent Reaper invasion, revealing that her team have set a massive asteroid to collide into a mass relay located within the Bahak system in batarian space in order to slow the Reapers' arrival. After her entire team is revealed to have been indoctrinated by the Reapers, Shepard has to stop Dr. Kenson from interrupting the asteroid's course, which culminates in Dr. Kenson killing herself after detonating an explosive device. If the player imports a save where the Arrival DLC is completed, Shepard's action of facilitating the destruction of the Bahak system's mass relay in order to delay the Reapers' invasion resulted in the loss of over 300,000 batarian lives, which leads to their imprisonment and impending trial in the beginning of Mass Effect 3.Maya Brooks Maya Brooks is the alias of a former Cerberus operative who serves as the main antagonist of the story campaign of the Mass Effect 3 DLC Citadel; she initially presents herself to Shepard as a Systems Alliance staff analyst. She is also responsible for sabotaging Lazarus Station, which housed the Lazarus Project that brought Shepard back from the dead, in order to steal a dormant clone of Shepard. Her actions led to the sequence of events following Shepard's awakening from a coma in Mass Effect 2. She later appears in Mass Effect: Foundation, a 13-issue comic book series starring most of Shepard's squad mates in the original trilogy, which is framed as reconnaissance by Brooks as the point-of-view character.The Kett The kett are a hostile militaristic species with dense formations of bone growing externally as armor protrusions on their bodies. They serve as the main antagonists of Mass Effect Andromeda. The kett are led by the Archon, who is voiced by Robert Kazinsky.Other charactersOriginal trilogyDavid Anderson Captain David Edward Anderson is a protagonist of the novel Mass Effect: Revelation, an experienced N7 marine and Commander Shepard's mentor throughout the Mass Effect trilogy. He is also the love interest of Kahlee Sanders. In the first game he was relieved of command of the SSV Normandy by Donnel Udina, and the starship was transferred to Shepard's command. By the events of Mass Effect 3 he is promoted to the rank of Admiral, and joins Shepard as a temporary squad mate early in the game during the early stages of the Reaper invasion. He appears dressed for battle in fatigues that would not reflect his rank but also wouldn't look out of place in a battlefield.Anderson is voiced by Keith David.IGN included the Finale in Mass Effect 3, where Shepard shares an emotional scene with Anderson and the Illusive man, in their list of 13 Best Mass Effect Moments.Kahlee Sanders Kahlee Sanders is a protagonist of Mass Effect: Revelation and its sequels, Ascension, Retribution, and Deception She is cited as one of the most important characters in the series, and the main heroine of Mass Effect spin-off fiction. She makes her first video game appearance in Mass Effect 3 as a staff member of the Grissom Academy.Dr. Chakwas Dr. Karin Chakwas is a recurring character in the Mass Effect series as the human doctor of the SSV Normandy, and later the Normandy SR-2. Dr. Chakwas survives the destruction of the SSV Normandy in Mass Effect 2, and later accepts Cerberus' offer to join Shepard in their fight against the Collectors, getting a position on the Normandy SR-2 as the ship's Chief Medical Officer. Dr. Chakwas returns in Mass Effect 3, provided she survives the suicide mission in Mass Effect 2. She may be recruited back to the Normandy, or be convinced to stay at the Citadel and assist in the war effort.Dr. Chakwas is voiced by Carolyn Seymour.Richard L. Jenkins Corporal Richard L. Jenkins is an Alliance Marine from the rural world of Eden Prime under the command of Captain Anderson, and a member of the SSV Normandy's crew. He joins Shepard as a squadmate during their incursion to his homeworld in Mass Effect, where he is killed shortly afterwards. He is based on the Leeroy Jenkins character.Conrad Verner Conrad Verner is a human fanatic who is obsessed with Commander Shepard. András Neltz from Kotaku notes that he is a 'crazy fan archetype taken to the next level', and an example of a character whose personality and fate could be shaped by the player throughout the original trilogy depending on how their player character reacts to Verner's antics.Khalisah al-Jilani Khalisah bint sinan al-Jilani is a human reporter from Westerlund News. She appears in all three games as a reporter who employs a belligerentline of questioning whenever she is granted an opportunity to interview Shepard. She also appears in Mass Effect Andromeda: Initiation, a prequel novel to Mass Effect: Andromeda.IGN included the running gag where Shepard can prematurely end their interview sessions with al-Jilani by punching her as a renegade action throughout the original trilogy in their list of 13 Best Mass Effect Moments. Beth Elderkin of Gizmodo referred to the aforementioned running gag as the 'Al-Jilani Saga' and one of her favorite moments.Administrator AnoleisAdministrator Bel Anoleis manages Port Hanshan, the capital of the planet Noveria, in the first Mass Effect. In order to obtain a garage pass to leave the port, Shepard could either prove the salarian bureaucrat's corruption to an undercover investigator named Gianna Parasini, side with Anoleis and turn over all the evidence to him, or pit Anoleis and Parasini against each other which leads to both of their deaths. András Neltz from Kotaku noted that the mission dealing with Anoleis was one of the most complex ones in the first game, and it was an early example 'showing how differently the story can go depending on the player's decisions'.Captain KirraheCaptain Kirrahe was the Salarian Special Tasks Group (STG) intelligence officer who uncovered Saren's facility on Virmire, and fights alongside Shepard's squad during the assault. Kirrahe's determination to destroy Saren's base, and thus the cure with it, causes a rift between Shepard and Wrex which may be resolved by the player in a number of ways. If he survives the battle, he will be promoted to Major and appears in Mass Effect 3 as an ally at various instances. Kirrahe's speech amidst a thunderstorm in Mass Effect is considered to be one of the original trilogy's most iconic moments by Kotaku's Gergo Vas.Steven Hackett Admiral Steven Hackett is a high-ranking official of the Earth Systems Alliance Navy's Fifth Fleet. He first appears as a minor character in Mass Effect who commands the Systems Alliance reinforcements which arrive to assist in the defense during the attack on the Citadel by Sovereign and the geth. During the course of the battle, he will defer to Shepard's wishes to either save the Citadel Councillors aboard the asari dreadnought the Destiny Ascension, or press the attack on Sovereign's forces. After the battle, he is promoted to head of the Alliance Navy. By the events of Mass Effect 3, he leads the entire Alliance forces in their struggle against the Reaper invasion.Hackett is voiced by Lance Henriksen.Kelly Chambers Kelly Chambers is Shepard's yeoman on the Normandy SR-2 in Mass Effect 2 whose primary role is administrative and clerical work. She keeps Commander Shepard notified of new e-mails and pass on meeting requests from Shepard's squad mates. In addition, Kelly utilizes her degree in psychology to provides counseling support and monitors the psychological state of Shepard and the crew. She is a romance option for a male or female Shepard, but does not grant the 'Paramour' achievement. If she survives the suicide mission in Mass Effect 2, she will appear in Mass Effect 3. She informs Shepard that she is on the run from Cerberus, her former employers. Shepard may ask her to continue assisting with the war effort, or go into hiding.Patrick Lee from AV Club brought up Chambers' potential fate in Mass Effect 3 as an example where a Paragon-aligned Shepard is 'not a saintly warrior-poet whose every decision is ethically and practically airtight'.Aria T'Loak Aria T'Loak, also known as 'the Pirate Queen', is an asari organized crime boss who serves as the de facto ruler of Omega Station, an important hub in the lawless Terminus Systems. She owns the Afterlife Club, which serves as the station's central hub. Her first chronological appearance is in Mass Effect: Incursion, an 8-page prequel comic to Mass Effect 2. She then makes a cameo in Mass Effect: Redemption, briefly assisting Liara's search for the missing Shepard. In Mass Effect 2, Aria provides Shepard with information on Omega. She then appears in Mass Effect: Retribution, and in the Mass Effect 3 DLC Omega, she appears as a temporary squad mate who wields powerful biotic abilities.Aria T'Loak is voiced by Carrie-Anne Moss.Armando-Owen BaileyCaptain Armando-Owen Bailey is a human C-Sec officer stationed in the Zakera Ward of the Citadel in Mass Effect 2. In Mass Effect 3, he is promoted to C-Sec Commander in-charge of C-Sec operations of the Citadel Embassies quarters. He is a mostly upstanding officer, but is pragmatic enough to bend the rules if it is more convenient or rewarding for him.Bailey is voiced by Michael Hogan.Kal'Reegar Kal'Reegar is a marine of the quarian Migrant Fleet who is assigned to protect Tali'Zorah, who is on a mission to perform research work on the planet Haestrom in Mass Effect 2.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Jotabeche\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Jotabeche is a Miocene-Pliocene caldera in the Atacama Region of Chile. It is part of the volcanic Andes, more specifically of the extreme southern end of the Central Volcanic Zone (CVZ). This sector of the Andean Volcanic Belt contains about 44 volcanic centres and numerous more minor volcanic systems, as well as some caldera and ignimbrite systems. Jotabeche is located in a now inactive segment of the CVZ, the Maricunga Belt.Jotabeche formed from the subduction of the Nazca plate beneath the South America plate, like the other volcanoes in the CVZ and the Andean Volcanic Belt. In the region of Jotabeche, during the late Miocene and Pliocene a change in the subduction geometry has caused volcanism to end, with volcanism shifting eastwards to the Incapillo volcanic centre. The crust beneath Jotabeche isthick, which has had effects on the rock composition of the volcano.Jotabeche has erupted two major ignimbrites between 8,500,000 and 5,900,000 years ago. The first ignimbrite was the larger one and is named Negro Francisco and the second is called Jotabeche proper. A caldera and some lava domes are also part of the complex. Volcanism ceased 5 million years ago.Geography and structureJotabeche is located at the extreme southern end of the Central Volcanic Zone (CVZ) of the Andes. The Central Volcanic Zone is one of the four volcanic zones of the Andean Volcanic Belt. In this belt, ongoing subduction of the Antarctica plate, Nazca plate and its precursor the Farallon plate are responsible for ongoing volcanic activity, including such volcanoes as Villarrica and Nevado del Ruiz. The Central Volcanic Zone sub-belt itself contains about 44 volcanic centres and over five major Quaternary caldera and ignimbrite complexes. The so-called Abancay deflection separates the CVZ in the north from the Peruvian flat subduction segment where no volcanic activity occurs, while the southern limit is marked by a seismic discontinuity around 27° S.Jotabeche is ahigh volcano with a caldera. A rhyolitic dome formed inside of the caldera. The Jotabeche complex reaches a thickness ofwhen including ignimbrite, lava domes and lavas. Thehigh andwide Jotabeche Norte stratovolcano is found northeast of Jotabeche and is surrounded by pyroclastic flows. The Santa Cecilia lava domes () have diameters ofand sit along along fault. The Miocene volcanic complex branches out in four chains stretching in east-west direction, the Cadillal, Aguas Blancas, Jotabeche Norte and Cordon de Yeguas Heladas. N-S to NE-SW trending faults border the volcanic complex and have allowed the intrusion of diorite porphyries. The resulting hydrothermally altered rocks are the sites of mineral deposits and prospects. These faults include the Yeguas Heladas, Rio La Gallina and Rio Astaburuaga and form a hexagonal structure which partly forms the margin of the caldera. Otherwise, only little erosion has taken place at Jotabeche; stronger erosion though has exposed a > thick hydrothermally altered complex at Aldebaran-Cerro Casale. Other hydrothermally altered areas are found within depressions. The crust beneath Jotabeche reaches a thickness of .GeologyJotabeche is a volcanic centre in the 26-6 mya old andlong Maricunga belt. Some stratovolcanoes in the belt include Copiapó-Azufre, Cerros Bravos, Doña Inés, La Laguna, Lagunillas, Ojos del Maricunga, Santa Rosa and Cadillal-Yeguas Heladas. Volcanic activity in this belt has also generated porphyry deposits containing silver, gold and copper. This belt is bordered by graben and horst tectonic structures that have generated the Salar de Maricunga and the Laguna de Negro Francisco.Jotabeche is located at the southern end of the Maricunga belt, which was active starting from the Oligocene until the Pliocene. The formation of this volcanic belt was influenced by the changes in the subduction of the Nazca plate, which included the shallowing of the subducting plate and the formation of the Puna plateau. Jotabeche, belonging to the fourth stage of Maricunga belt activity after the third stage of Copiapo, is the youngest eruption of the Maricunga belt, whose activity ended with the Jotabeche caldera forming eruption. Volcanism afterwards shifted eastwards. Jotabeche is one of the largest volcanoes in the Maricunga belt. Volcanic activity at Jotabeche is coeval with the last mineralization phase of the Vallecito system in the El Indio belt.LocalJotabeche is part of the so-called Cordillera de Darwin segment of the Andes. The basement in the area consists of various sedimentary-volcanic formations dating back to the Paleozoic Chinches formation but also including the Jurassic Lautaro formation and the Cretaceous Quebrada de Monardes formation. Of the volcanic formations, the Pantanoso rhyolitic formation of the Paleozoic and the thick andesitic-dacitic lava flows of the mesozoic Rio Aguas Blancas formation are the most important. During the Cretaceous, local extension formed a number of small faults in the area. The oldest of these sequences crops out east of Jotabeche at the Chilean-Argentine frontier.CompositionJotabeche has generated rhyodacite rocks.

They were founded in Rouen, France, in 1666, as part of the work of Nicolas Barré, a Minim friar and Catholic priest (1621-1686), who had gathered some young women for the free instruction of the poor in 1662.Today, the Infant Jesus Sisters and their lay volunteers have a presence worldwide through social projects and schools. They are also known as Dames of St.-Maur, from the address of their major house in Paris.The foundation of Barré's schools and of the Sisters suggested to St. John Baptist de La Salle the idea of accomplishing a similar work for boys, resulting in his founding of the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools.HistoryOriginsIn 1659 Barré, who was a respected scholar within his Order, was sent to the monastery of the Order in Rouen. He became widely known as a preacher and his sermons attracted a large audience. In 1662 Barré saw the need for the education of the poor in France.France in the late 17th century was suffering from the effects of the Franco-Spanish War (1635–1659) and a terrible plague. As a result of his efforts to promote a planned parish mission in the nearby village of Sotteville-lès-Rouen, Barré came to see the suffering of the local population. To enable parents to attend the mission, Barré asked two young women to come and help with the children. One was a local resident, Françoise Duval, 18 years old, the other was Marguerite Lestocq, then aged 20, who, like him, was from Amiens and with whom he had family connections.He saw the need to make basic education more accessible to all. There were hardly any schools for girls and very few for boys. Most primary school teachers were poorly educated and religious education was almost non-existent; there was profound ignorance of the Catholic faith. In 1662, half the children in Rouen died of famine. Many were homeless and wandered the streets as beggars and, for some, prostitution became one of the few means of livelihood available.They began to give daily classes to young girls in a room which they were allowed to use, spending that year in this work. Soon three other young women joined them, and two separate schools were opened. Barré would visit the classes frequently, guiding the young women in how to teach and deal with both the children and their parents, drawing upon his own rigorous education under the Jesuits and his experience as a professor. He taught them the value of “instruction and education” and from the beginning he trained the young teachers to respect the uniqueness of each child and to develop each one’s potential. The teachers were to speak in a humble, gentle and simple manner so that even the youngest could understand, and they were to teach only what they themselves had adequately grasped.As the enrollment increased, more schools were established, and four years later, the ladies in charge of these schools began to live in a community under a Superior. This was the beginning of a religious congregation whose main work was the education of the poor.The year 1666 saw the founding of the Congregation of the Sisters of the Infant Jesus. After several years of teaching in the schools, the five young women were invited by Barré to consider becoming part of a committed community. After some reflection, they felt that they were indeed called to this way of life and agreed. These women were not bound by religious vows or confined to a cloister. They were free to serve the local community and provide free education for poor children. They committed themselves to this in a legal document drawn up in 1669, becoming called the Charitable Teachers of the Infant Jesus (). As part of their living in trust in God, it was established that the material needs of the schools were to be handled by women outside the new community.Expansion and division Due to his declining health, in 1675 Barré was sent to the Minim monastery in Paris. Though limited in his activities, he promoted new foundations of his 'charitable schools of Providence', starting with two, Saint Jean en Grèves and Saint Nicolas des Champs, training teachers, both men and women for them. He urged his teachers not to wait until pupils arrived at the school; they were to seek out especially those who might be at risk. He also set up trade schools so that girls could earn a living. Again, the education offered was to be entirely free and any profit derived from the pupils’ work was to go to them.In 1677 Barré began to send teachers to other locations in France, starting with his native Picardy, reaching as far as New France in North America. These women were not part of a religious institute, and so were free to serve their local communities as needed, without the barriers that status would have imposed at that time.Around that time, he acquired a house located on the Rue Saint Maur in the 6th arrondissement of Paris (now called the Rue de l'Abbé Grégoire), which was to become the motherhouse of the Institute. In 1677 a convent was established in Rue Saint Maur, Paris (ii) and the Sisters were subsequently known as the 'Dames of St. Maur'. In 1678, Barré founded a novitiate for the sisters on the Seine.The Daughters of Providence were members of a Catholic religious congregation for women founded in 1643, by a pious widow, Marie Polaillon (née de Lumague) under a Rule of Life drawn up by Vincent de Paul. The Daughters would profess annual vows of obedience, chastity, service and stability. In 1681 several houses of the congregation merged with the Sisters of the Congregation of the Holy Infant Jesus, becoming the Sisters of St. Maur and of Providence. A number of ‘Little Charitable Schools’ were established throughout France. In 1683 Mother Françoise Duval, one of the foundresses, was sent to open a school in Lisieux. At the time of Barré's death in 1686, there were over 100 schools being operated by the Sisters of the Holy Infant Jesus throughout France.Throughout his life, Barré had refused to allow the schools to accept benefices as a means of support, determined to place his trust in God alone, and was followed in this commitment by the teachers of the Institute. Upon his death, however, the lay trustees in Paris and Rouen, who were in charge of the finances of the schools and the teachers who staffed them, strongly disagreed over whether or not to continue this practice.This was eventually referred to the royal court, and, in 1691, King Louis XIV divided the Institute into three independent groups, with motherhouses in Rouen, Paris and Lisieux.The Sisters in the original communities became known as the Sisters of Providence of Rouen and in 1921 became a congregation of diocesan right, under the authority of the local bishops where they served, with a missionary outreach in Madagascar and Central Africa. The group based in Lisieux also became a diocesan congregation. The Sisters of St Maur in Paris became an institute of pontifical right with communities in five continents.Current era The French Revolution closed all the schools of the institute and it was not until 1805 a new community of teachers was formed by seven surviving members. Less than twenty-five years after the opening of the motherhouse in Paris, eighty schools for free education and forty boarding schools had been established in France. With the granting of official approval from Rome, the Sisters extended their work to America, England, Spain, Malaysia, Japan and Thailand. The new growth of the Institute was such that, by the mid-19th century, schools were opened in Spain and Asia. 'Sisters of the Holy Infant Jesus (Dames of Saint Maur) were among the pioneer missionaries in British Malaya, Japan and Thailand. In 1887, after over 200 years of service without the taking of religious vows, this congregation of Sisters became a religious institute of pontifical right, able to operate independently worldwide.Southeast Asia In 1849 a Catholic missionary in the Straits Settlements, Reverend Father Jean-Marie Beurel, a native of Saint-Brieuc in France, suggested to the colonial governor, William John Butterworth, that it might be worthwhile to found a charitable organisation for girls next to the Church in Victoria Street. In August 1852, Beurel bought the house at the corner of Victoria Street and Bras Basah Road. Beurel then appealed to the Superior General of the congregation in France for Sisters to run a school.Malaysia Four Sisters were sent to the East. After a long and perilous voyage, one had died at sea, three of them landed at Penang in April 1852. That same year, the three Sisters established a convent that contained an orphanage and school in Penang. In September 1852, the Congregation sent four Sisters to Penang, with Mother Mathilde Raclot in charge, to guide and support the group of sisters who had arrived earlier. The school, Convent Light Street (Malay: SMK Convent Lebuh Light), is Penang's oldest girls' school and has occupied its current site along Light Street near historic George Town for over 150 years. While on the peninsula, the Sisters continued establishing schools with help from the local community such as Kuala Lumpur's oldest girls' school Convent Bukit Nanas and the only Chinese convent girls school Convent Datuk Keramat in Penang. In 1952, St Bernadette's convent school was built in Pusing Road, Batu Gajah Perak with land donated and funds raised from communities. During World War II, the Japanese invaded Malaya and either took over or closed down many such mission schools, notably the iconic Convent Primary School in the hills of Tanah Rata. The Tanah Rata convent is one of the few in the region which still contains an operating school and a church. Today, CHIJ schools can be found in most states and many major cities and they continue to educate local girls of all races and religions.SingaporeIn February 1854, three Sisters led by Rev. Mother Mathilde Raclot arrived in Singapore from Penang and set up the convent in Singapore at Victoria Street. Soon they also started a Convent Orphanage and a Home for Abandoned Babies as they found day-old babies were being left at their doorstep.To raise funds for their work, Mother Mathilde taught needlework to her fellow nuns and their students, and they sold their products to the wives of the local Chinese merchants. The school became well-known and within ten years, the enrollment had increased to 300. Secondary education began in 1905. Under Mother Hombeline, the expansion programme continued.The convent occupied a full street block bordered by Bras Basah Road, Stamford Road, Victoria St and North Bridge Road. The iconic church was deconsecrated during the 1980s. Part of the Sisters' quarters has been demolished and converted into SMRT Corporation offices. Most of the original buildings were redeveloped as part of the Heritage Board's preservation scheme. The complex has since been redeveloped into a high-end retail complex called CHIJmes while the church is now a popular attraction for tourists and those interested in history.The eleven CHIJ schools in Singapore can trace their history to the Victoria Street convent. Satellite schools were founded before and after World War II. The 'original' convent school is the present-day CHIJ Secondary and CHIJ Primary schools in Toa Payoh. CHIJ Saint Nicholas Girls' School (CHIJ SNGS) was co-located on the same site and functioned as the Chinese section while CHIJ Secondary and Primary were English-medium. After the abolition of vernacular schools, CHIJ SNGS was granted SAP status. All three schools moved out of the Victoria Street complex during the 1980s into larger and more spacious facilities.East AsiaJapan In 1872, Mother Mathilde led the first group of French nuns to Japan and founded the Saint Maur International School in Yokohama, where they teach and cared for the disadvantaged Japanese women and children. Mother Mathilde Raclot died, aged 97, in 1911 whilst still in Yokohama, Japan, and buried there.Europe The shortage of English teachers forced the Sisters to turn to the British Isles in hopes of recruiting and training potential missionary teachers. In 1909, Mother St Beatrice Foley, who had returned from Singapore, established Drishane Convent in Ireland. It had a 'knitting school' for younger girls and was also used to train teachers for the Asian mission. Less than half a decade after opening, the convent was churning out teachers and Sisters and sending them to Asia and South America.South America The Sisters first set foot in South America during the 1960s. Some of the Spanish-speaking Sisters arrived in Peru in 1967 and have since expanded to several other countries in the continent.Motto The motto is Simple dans ma vertu, Forte dans mon devoir, which is often translated into 'Simple in Virtue, Steadfast in Duty', is featured on the badges of IJ schools worldwide.

The order's emblem features the Infant Jesus cradled in the arms of Blessed Virgin Mary. The nuns of the order have a simple dress code that consists of a black habit and a crucifix. Each sister is also encouraged to wear a medal of the Infant Jesus as a symbol of their faith. The congregation is divided into provinces that are presided over by elected leaders. The highest authority in the order is the Superior General based in France, who oversees the governance of the congregation.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Turkish Cypriots\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Turkish Cypriots or Cypriot Turks ( or Kıbrıslı Türkler; ) are mostly ethnic Turks originating from Cyprus. Following the Ottoman conquest of the island in 1571, about 30,000 Turkish settlers were given land once they arrived in Cyprus. Additionally, many of the island's local Christians converted to Islam during the early years of Ottoman rule. Nonetheless, the influx of mainly Muslim settlers to Cyprus continued intermittently until the end of the Ottoman period. Today, while Northern Cyprus is home to a significant part of the Turkish Cypriot population, the majority of Turkish Cypriots live abroad, forming the Turkish Cypriot diaspora. This diaspora came into existence after the Ottoman Empire transferred the control of the island to the British Empire, as many Turkish Cypriots emigrated primarily to Turkey and the United Kingdom for political and economic reasons.Standard Turkish is the official language of Northern Cyprus. The vernacular spoken by Turkish Cypriots is Cypriot Turkish, which has been influenced by Cypriot Greek as well as English.HistoryPre-Ottoman Cyprus Although there was no settled Muslim population in Cyprus prior to the Ottoman conquest of 1570–71, some Ottoman Turks were captured andcarried off as prisoners to Cyprus in the year 1400 during Cypriot raids in the Asiatic and Egyptian coasts. Some of these captives accepted or were forced to convert to Christianity and were baptized; however, there were also some Turkish slaves who remained unbaptized. By 1425, some of these slaves helped the Mamluke army to gain access to Limassol Castle. Despite the release of some of the captives, after the payment of ransoms, most of the baptized Turks continued to remain on the island. The medieval Cypriot historian Leontios Machairas recalled that the baptized Turks were not permitted to leave Nicosia when the Mamlukes approached the city after the battle of Khirokitia in 1426. According to Professor Charles Fraser Beckingham, 'there must therefore have been some Cypriots, at least nominally Christian, who were of Turkish, Arab, or Egyptian origin.'By 1488, the Ottomans made their first attempt at conquering Cyprus when Sultan Bayezid II sent a fleet to conquer Famagusta. However, the attempt failed due to the timely intervention of a Venetian fleet. The Queen of Cyprus, Caterina Cornaro, was forced to relinquish her crown to the Republic of Venice in 1489. In the same year, Ottoman ships were seen off the coast of Karpas and the Venetians began to strengthen the fortifications of the island. By 1500, coastal raids by Ottoman vessels resulted in the heavy loss of Venetian fleets, forcing Venice to negotiate a peace treaty with the Ottoman Empire in 1503. However, by May 1539 Suleiman I decided to attack Limassol because the Venetians had been sheltering pirates who continuously attacked Ottoman ships. Limassol stayed under Ottoman control until a peace treaty was signed in 1540. Cyprus continued to be a haven for pirates who interrupted the safe passage of Ottoman trade ships and Muslim pilgrims sailing to Mecca and Medina. By 1569, pirates captured the Ottoman defterdar (treasurer) of Egypt, and Selim II decided to safeguard the sea route from Constantinople to Alexandria by conquering the island and clearing the eastern Mediterranean of all enemies in 1570–71.Ottoman CyprusThe basis for the emergence of a sizeable and enduring Turkish community in Cyprus emerged when Ottoman troops landed on the island in mid-May 1570 and seized it within a year from Venetian rule. The post-conquest period established a significant Muslim community which consisted of soldiers from the campaign who remained behind and further settlers who were brought from Anatolia as part of a traditional Ottoman population policy. There were also new converts to Islam on the island during the early years of Ottoman rule.In addition to documented settlement of Anatolian peasants and craftsmen, as well as the arrival of soldiers, decrees were also issued banishing Anatolian tribes, 'undesirable' persons, and members of various 'troublesome' Muslim sects, principally those officially classified as heretical. This influx of mainly Muslim settlers to Cyprus continued intermittently until the end of the Ottoman period.Some Turkish Cypriots are descendants of Crypto-Christians, a phenomenon that was not uncommon in the Ottoman Empire given its multi-faith character. In Cyprus, many Latins and Maronites, as well as Greeks, converted to Islam at different points during Ottoman rule for a number of reasons ranging from collectively avoiding heavy taxation to ending an individual woman unhappy marriage. Their artificial embrace of Islam and their secret maintaining of Christianity led this group of crypto-Christians to be known in Greek as 'Linobamvaki' or the cotton-linen sect as they changed religion to curry favour with Ottoman officials during the day but practiced Catholicism at night. In 1636 the conditions for the Christians became intolerable and certain Christians decided to become Muslims. According to Palmieri (1905) the Maronites who became Muslims lived mainly in the Nicosia District and despite the fact that the Maronites turned to Muslims they never gave up their Christian faith and beliefs hoping to become Christians. This is why they baptized their children according to the Christian faith, but they also practiced circumcision. They also gave their children two names, a Muslim and a Christian one. Many of the villages and neighbouring areas accepted as Turkish Cypriot estates, were formerly Linobambaki activity centers. These include:By the second quarter of the nineteenth century, approximately 30,000 Muslims were living in Cyprus, comprising about 35", "machine_text": "Turkish Cypriots are the ethnic Turkish inhabitants of the island of Cyprus.

The result of 95 years of additions, subtractions, deductions, and exclusions, the 62,000 page tax code is so complex that many are voicing their desire to greatly simplify it or to even completely remove it. Currently, tax revenue cannot even pay for government spending. The film follows the progression of taxation through wars, economic booms, and significant presidencies in U.S. history. An Inconvenient Tax includes commentary from some of the nation's best-known economic experts, commentators, and political voices. Noam Chomsky, Ron Paul, Steve Forbes, Joseph Thorndike, Mike Huckabee, Charles Rossotti, David Walker, Neal Boortz, Herman Cain, Michael Graetz, Daniel Shaviro, Leonard Burman, and others discuss perceived problems in the American tax code, and also suggest possible changes. The possible solutions discussed include the FairTax, flat tax, and value added tax (VAT).An Inconvenient Tax was officially released on Tax Day – April 15, 2010.Press On April 11, 2011, Life Is My Movie Entertainment announced that An Inconvenient Tax had been acquired by Gravitas Ventures and would be distributed through cable, satellite, telco, and online Video-on-Demand (VOD) in June of that year.

The film argues that the United States tax system is unfair, complicated, and inefficient, and it advocates for a complete overhaul of the tax code. The documentary uses interviews with economists, business owners, and taxpayers to illustrate the problems with the current system, including high tax rates, excessive regulations, and loopholes that benefit the wealthy. It suggests that a flat tax or a consumption tax would be more fair and simpler, eliminating many of the problems with the current system. An Inconvenient Tax took its title from the 2006 documentary An Inconvenient Truth, which dealt with the issue of global warming and climate change. The producers of the film chose this title to emphasize the complexity and confusion of the tax system, which can create a burden for taxpayers. The film received mixed reviews, with some critics praising its advocacy for tax reform and others criticizing its oversimplification of the issues and its one-sided focus on conservative perspectives. Despite these criticisms, An Inconvenient Tax has become a popular entry point for many viewers to learn about the problems with the U.S. tax system and the potential for reform. In conclusion, An Inconvenient Tax is an American documentary that acts as a call for tax reform in the United States. Through a combination of expert commentary, interviews, and data, the documentary highlights the complexity and inefficiency of the American tax system and suggests a flat tax or consumption tax as a solution. The film has been both praised and criticized, but has become an important reference point for those seeking a better understanding of the current state of the American tax system.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 21065038}

It premiered Off-Broadway at the Phoenix Theatre on February 11, 1965, and ran for 99 performances. The play was later televised on NBC in 1966. The Happy Ending tells the story of a black couple named John and Mary Williams, who are struggling to make ends meet. John is a hardworking factory worker, while Mary is a homemaker trying to keep the family together. They dream of moving out of their rundown apartment in Harlem to provide a better life for their children. Their plans are further complicated by the arrival of John's mother, who disapproves of their living situation and believes John should abandon his dreams of owning a beauty parlor. The play deals with themes of racial identity, economic struggle, and familial conflict. The characters grapple with societal pressures and the limited opportunities available to them due to their race and economic status. Despite these challenges, they maintain a sense of hope and strive for a happy ending. The play was widely acclaimed for its portrayal of the African American experience and its nuanced exploration of racial issues. It was seen as a landmark production that highlighted the struggles and aspirations of black Americans during the Civil Rights Movement. In addition to its theatrical success, The Happy Ending was adapted into a film in 1969, featuring renowned actors such as Jean Simmons and John Forsythe. The play's enduring popularity has made it a staple in the theatrical canon, and it continues to be studied and performed today.

Apparently not satisfied with the Petter Browning design or the changes they had made to it, SIG evaluated no fewer than 11 prototypes from 1942 through 1944. Selbstladepistole Neuhausen model 44/16 pistol production began in 1944. Some of the original Petter Browning features had been retained, specifically the self-contained firing and recoil systems.The Neuhausen 44/16 had a magazine capacity of 16 rounds.Development was slowed by the Second World War. After testing various experimental models (such as the aforementioned 44/16 with a double-column magazine), the 47/8 model was adopted in Oct 1948 as the Pistole Modell 1949 (P49), and SP47/8 for civilian market. Some previous series were tested by Swedish sport shooters and by the Danish army (Danish Defence designation Pistol M/1949).The 47/8 model supported the easy change of the barrels between 7.65 and 9mm Parabellum and a kit to convert to .22 caliber (see table below).SIG M/1949 is the 47/8 model purchased for the Danish military and issued version for officers, military police, and special forces, chambered in 9mm Luger.Usually called only Neuhausen in Denmark, this model is stamped 'P m/49', and also known as 'P210-DK'. First issued beginning in 1950 to the Danish Army Technical Corps (stamped 'HTK'), this remained the standard sidearm in the Danish military throughout 60 years of continuous use, since the 2010s being replaced with the SIG Sauer P320 X-5 Carry.In 1957, the civil designation (SP47/8) was definitively changed to P210 according to the company nomenclature policy. Model P210-1 in retrospect covers all models produced until 1965, the designation P210-2 refers to the standard model as produced from 1966 (beginning with serial nr. P 59071).P210-3 was a police version produced from 1951 to 1964 (serial nrs. P 6791 to P 6840 and P 8001 to P 8893), produced in limited numbers for the cantonal police forces of Basel, Lausanne, and Glarus, with a handful sold on the private market. P210-4 was the model made for the German border guard (serial nrs. D 1 to D 6500). P210-5 and P210-6 were civilian target shooting models made in the 1980s and 1990s. P210-7 was a rarely produced .22lr rimfire model, made in the 1950s and 1960s.SIG was renamed to SIG Sauer upon acquisition by SauerSohn in the 1970s, and to Swiss Arms in 2000.Swiss Arms continued production of the P210 for private customers until 2006.From 2010, a new model, dubbed P210 Legend was made by SIG Sauer, GMBH of Eckernförde, Germany. This model was exported to the USA until 2017, whenSIG Sauer Inc. of New Hampshirebegan production of its own model, dubbed P210A, made in Exeter, N.H., offered in two versions, Standard (210A-9-B) and Target (210A-9-TGT).Serial numbers Serial numbers startingA are the Swiss army ordnance models.Army models run from serial number A 100001 to A 213110. Those that have a P added to the rear of a serial number that starts with an A have been sold by the Swiss army to civilians.A stamped 'P' (='privat') on the front of the trigger guard shows that a weapon was left as a gift to the owner upon leaving the Armed Services.Serial numbers 6001 to 6028 are prototypes made during 1938–1947. 6033 to 6406 are early model SP47/8 made in 1947.Serial numbers with a P were made for police and for private use, running fromP 8001 to P 8250 (1951) andP 50004 (1949) to P 79150 (1975).Serial numbers from P 79600 to P 97950are private models made by SIG Sauer, Switzerland, during 1976–1984, and P 300001 to P 331536 were made by Sig Sauer (Swiss Arms) during 1983–2006; the jump to the 300000s range marks the transition from traditional forged frames to CNC production.During 1966–1969, SIG produced a small number of special heavy frame P210-5 models for the National Match team. These are extremely rare, with a total of 46 pieces known in literature. In the 1970s, these heavy frame models were commercialized and offered on the market, with100 pieces of P210-6 heavy frame pistols (P 76521 to P76620) made in 1979,and 50 pieces ofP210-6 heavy frame pistols, made for HofmannReinhart of Zürich (P 79101 to 79150). These pistols represent the pinnacle of SIG pistol manufacture and are extremely sought after by collectors, and consequently almost never offered on the open market.Another special edition is numbered JP 1 to JP 500 (1978, '125 Years of SIG' anniversary edition). P 555001 to P 555555 are special collectors' edition of 555 sets of five chromed pistols with gilded controls, P210, P220, P225, P226 and P230, made for Vonbank AG in 1987 to 1990), at the time sold for CHF 12,950. In 1991, another special edition numbered № 0001 to № 1991 was made to commemorate '700 Years of Swiss Confederation' (700 Jahre Eidgenossenschaft), at the time sold for CHF 4,100 per piece.Serial numbers starting with a D belong to the Bundesgrenzschutz issues(D 1 to D 6500). The Danish m/49 pistols have their own serial numbers, without a leading letter, engraved on the right side of the slide, running from 7695 (1951) to 35383 (1962). The rare P210-7 .22lr calibre versions have numbers in the range 40501 (1957) to 41762 (1968).GalleryUsers: used by the Danish Defense Force as m/49.: Used by the Presidential Security Service since 2007.: used by the Latvian National Guard. : used by the Compagnie des Carabiniers du Prince.: used by the Swiss Military and various police forces.ReferencesArmbruster, Erwin,Werner Kessler (ed.).

The pistol was initially created for Swiss military use as their standard service weapon and has since gained widespread popularity among gun enthusiasts. The SIG P210 has been a favorite firearm among competitive shooters and collectors alike since its introduction. Characterized by its smooth handling and precision accuracy, the SIG P210 features a single-action trigger and a weight between 900 and 1,000 grams depending on the model. It is a recoil-operated weapon with a vertically tilting barrel that secures its rounds in a locked breech. The P210 is crafted with a steel frame and slide and comes in several variations, including the P210-4, P210-5, and P210-6. The P210-4 was used by the Swiss military and was made in 9mm, .30 Luger, and 7.65mm Browning; the P210-5 is chambered in .22lr, commonly used in competitive shooting; and the P210-6 features a magazine disconnect, allowing the pistol to only fire when the magazine is inserted. The P210 is a firearm with a rich history. In addition to being used by the Swiss Army and marking Switzerland's neutrality during wars, it was adopted by several other military forces and police departments worldwide. In 1949, the French government acquired the rights to produce the P210, which was then manufactured by Manurhin until it discontinued production in 1978. Today, the SIG P210 remains a popular choice among competitive shooters and collectors due to its precision and build quality. The gun has been modernized over the years but still maintains the original design elements that have made it a classic firearm.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 499258}

The building of South Gare lighthouse was planned and supervised by John Fowler, engineer to the Tees Conservancy Commissioners. Both light systems were used until 1892 when use of the light towers at Seaton Carew was discontinued by the Tees Conservancy Commissioners.The South Gare lighthouse light was originally lit by a paraffin wick lamp. and perhaps subsequently by a pressurised paraffin burner. This was removed in 1955, and in about 1980 the chimney and weather vane were removed. The paraffin lamp was replaced by a mains powered 500 Watt tungsten filament Incandescent light bulb with a backup bulb on the bulb changer that operated with a backup diesel generator. The light operated with a 1.5 s flash every 12 seconds. The lens rotation mechanism was originally powered by a clockwork motor but this was replaced by two electric motors, i.e. one duty motor and a backup motor. A fog signal was mounted to the west of the lighthouse but this has evidently been removed. The light source was a 35 Watt CDM-T lamp until 2007 when it was replaced by a 45 Watt high intensity LED lamp.DescriptionThe lighthouse ishigh with a cylindrical cast iron clad stone tower all painted white. Small porthole windows in the north and south side of the column light an internal helical newel staircase.The light source is held in the original eight windowed lantern housing under a hemispherical copper domed roof. Below the windows there is a railed circular platform supported by brackets. The current light source is a 45 Watt high intensity LED with a fourth order prismatic lens and can be seen for a range of . Setabove mean high water the light operates automatically exhibiting sectored red and white with a 0.5 s flash every 12 seconds with an effective intensity of 150,000 Candelas. The light is powered by a Schlunk 100 Watt water-cooled hydrogen fuel cell a world first. This arrangement is more reliable than the mains electricity supply along the exposed breakwater because of its vulnerability in storms.The lighthouse is a listed building and still operates using the original lenses. Today the lighthouse is owned and operated by PD Ports, and has the Admiralty code A2626, NGA code 2020, and Amateur Radio Lighthouse Society (ARLHS) code ENG-131.

The lighthouse's primary purpose is to guide passing vessels through the Teesmouth, which is an important shipping lane. The original South Gare Lighthouse was constructed in 1884 and stood 37 feet tall. It was built of brick with an outer covering of stone, and a single revolving light could be seen from a distance of 13 nautical miles. In 1905, the lighthouse was dismantled and replaced with a larger structure made of reinforced concrete. The new lighthouse was designed by Henry Edmund Goodridge, a prominent lighthouse architect of the time. It stands 48 feet tall with a gallery and lantern room, and its light can be seen up to 20 nautical miles away. During its early years, the lighthouse was manned by a team of keepers who maintained the light and surrounding structures, including the fog signal, which was installed in 1907. After automated equipment was installed in the 1980s, the lighthouse was no longer staffed. However, the Coastguard continues to monitor the light and fog siren remotely. Today, the South Gare Lighthouse and its surrounding structures are listed buildings and protected by law. They are also popular tourist attractions, with visitors able to climb to the top of the lighthouse and enjoy stunning panoramic views of the surrounding landscape. Overall, the South Gare Lighthouse is a significant engineering feat of the late 19th century and continues to serve the purpose for which it was built; to provide vital navigation aid to vessels passing through the Teesmouth.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 35070152}

It is commonly known as the spider starfish or the North Atlantic sea star. The species was first described by the Norwegian zoologist G.O. Sars in 1861. Distribution and Habitat: Luidia sarsii is found in the northern Atlantic Ocean, including the North Sea and the coasts of Norway, Greenland, Iceland, and eastern Canada. They prefer to inhabit rocky areas with a depth range of 15-300 meters, but can also be found in soft seabed like mud or sand. Description: Luidia sarsii has a flat, star-shaped body that has a combination of brown, red, and orange colors. They are quite large and can have five to seven arms, which are very long - about three to four times the length of the central disk. The arms are broad, tapering, and helically twisted when detached from the body. The ventral grooves on the arms are covered in tiny bristle-like spines, which they use to move and capture prey. Behavior and Diet: Luidia sarsii is a carnivorous animal that feeds on a wide range of organisms including clams, snails, crabs, and sea urchins. It captures its prey by extending its arms and enveloping its target, before retracting the arms to bring the prey towards its mouth. The species is nocturnal and is often found feeding at night. Conservation: There is insufficient information on the conservation status of Luidia sarsii. However, like other marine animals, it is threatened by pollution, habitat degradation, and overfishing.

Its tiny territory comprised Cerenzia itself, the (now defunct) hamlets of Verzino and Lucrò and the castrum of Caccuri.It is first documented in the Notitia Episcopatuum of the Patriarchate of Constantinople, edited under Byzantine emperor Leo VI the Wise (died 912).Until the Norman conquest of Calabria (mid 11th century), it was in the sway of the above patriarchate and used its Greek-language Byzantine rite. A papal bulla by Pope Lucius III in 1183 explicitly mentions its being a suffragan of Santa Severina.Noted early (late 11th century) bishop Policronius, recuperated the 'Greek' abbey of Santa Maria di Altilia. The bishoprics rich gifts and possessions aroused greed among the local barons, especially Marchisorto, count of Crotone Stefano, tried to impose in 1205 his chaplain, Madio, instead of legitimate bishop Guglielmo, elected by the (cathedral) chapter.The arrival of the Angevine rule spelled the diocese's decline, among more conflict with the feudal lords, requiring appeals to Metropolitan and Pope.Mid Trecento (14th century), the area suffered health problems like malaria and from its poor position, even for drinking water, leading to the city being abandoned and the countryside depopulated by harsh feudal impositions.In 1342 the phrase 'Bishop of Cerenzia and Cariati' was coined, after the new effective seat, and in 1437[4], Pope Eugenius IV formally erected a Diocese of Cariati, immediately placing it in personal union (aeque principaliter) with the old see of Cerenzia. Given the decay of Cerenzia and its episcopal palace, when the Council of Trento imposed on all bishops a fixed residence, Cariati at sea, despite its exposure to Ottoman Turkish raids, was chosen over sickly isolated Cerenzia.A pest epidemic in 1528 caused the town of Cerenzia and its five parishes to be abandoned, losing its diocesan archive. È in questa occasione che andò in gran parte perduto anche l'archivio. Visiting in the late Cinquecento, bishop Properzio Resta described its pitiful state, including cathedral and palace (Pesavento). Bishops' attempts in the Seicento and Settecento to restore the cathedral and build a new palace were undone by repeated, demotivating earthquakes.As part of a reorganization of the dioceses of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, Pope Pius VII in 1818 incorporated the already united territory of the diocese of Cerenza into that of the diocese of Cariati, later merged itself into the present Archdiocese of Rossano-Cariati Vincenzio d'Avino,As is customary, the bull referred to the see in adjectival form, and called it , suggesting as the Latin substantive (noun) form: .

He attended Truro School on a scholarship and excelled in languages, going on to graduate with a first in French and German from Oriel College, Oxford. He then moved to Queen's College to study for a D.Phil. in 18th-century French literature.House of Commons career He became a clerk in the Commons Library in 1954. When given responsibility for the research area in 1964 he introduced a system of comprehensive daily briefings for MPs, and he was promoted to Deputy Librarian in 1967. When Speaker George Thomas appointed him 10th Librarian of the Commons Library in 1976, he began a process of modernisation. He set up the Public Information Office (now the House of Commons Information Office) in 1978, and electronic publication began the same year, when the Library contributed to the Prestel viewdata system, which at one time had 90,000 subscribers. Computerisation of the Library's information systems began in 1979 with the creation of the Parliamentary On-Line Information System (POLIS). He also established a service for schools. The new systems introduced by Menhennet enabled MPs to find and check information far more easily, and were used particularly often by Gordon Brown and Tony Blair while in opposition.Menhennet hosted international conferences at Westminster, and also acted as an adviser to other parliaments.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Nebuchadnezzar II\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Nebuchadnezzar II (Babylonian cuneiform:Nabû-kudurri-uṣur, meaning 'Nabu, watch over my heir'; Biblical Hebrew:Nəḇūḵaḏneʾṣṣar), also spelled Nebuchadrezzar II, was the second king of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, ruling from the death of his father Nabopolassar in 605 BC to his own death in 562 BC. Historically known as Nebuchadnezzar the Great, he is typically regarded as the empire's greatest king. Nebuchadnezzar remains famous for his military campaigns in the Levant, for his construction projects in his capital, Babylon, and for the important part he played in Jewish history. Ruling for 43 years, Nebuchadnezzar was the longest-reigning king of the Chaldean dynasty. At the time of his death, Nebuchadnezzar was among the most powerful rulers in the world.Possibly named after his grandfather of the same name, or after Nebuchadnezzar I ( 1125–1104 BC), one of Babylon's greatest ancient warrior-kings, Nebuchadnezzar II already secured renown for himself during his father's reign, leading armies in the Medo-Babylonian war against the Assyrian Empire. At the Battle of Carchemish in 605 BC, Nebuchadnezzar inflicted a crushing defeat on an Egyptian army led by Pharaoh Necho II, and ensured that the Neo-Babylonian Empire would succeed the Neo-Assyrian Empire as the dominant power in the ancient Near East. Shortly after this victory, Nabopolassar died and Nebuchadnezzar became king. Despite his successful military career during his father's reign, the first third or so of Nebuchadnezzar's reign saw little to no major military achievements, and notably a disastrous failure in an attempted invasion of Egypt. These years of lacklustre military performance saw some of Babylon's vassals, particularly in the Levant, beginning to doubt Babylon's power, viewing the Neo-Babylonian Empire as a 'paper tiger' rather than a power truly on the level of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. The situation grew so severe that people in Babylonia itself began disobeying the king, some going as far as to revolt against Nebuchadnezzar's rule.After this disappointing early period as king, Nebuchadnezzar's luck turned. In the 580s BC, Nebuchadnezzar engaged in a successful string of military actions in the Levant against the vassal states in rebellion there, likely with the ultimate intent of curbing Egyptian influence in the region. In 587 BC, Nebuchadnezzar destroyed the Kingdom of Judah, and its capital, Jerusalem. The destruction of Jerusalem led to the Babylonian captivity as the city's population, and people from the surrounding lands, were deported to Babylonia. The Jews thereafter referred to Nebuchadnezzar, the greatest enemy they had faced until that point, as a 'destroyer of nations'. The biblical Book of Jeremiah paints Nebuchadnezzar as a cruel enemy, but also as God's appointed ruler of the world and a divine instrument to punish disobedience. Through the destruction of Jerusalem, the capture of the rebellious Phoenician city of Tyre, and other campaigns in the Levant, Nebuchadnezzar completed the Neo-Babylonian Empire's transformation into the new great power of the ancient Near East.In addition to his military campaigns, Nebuchadnezzar is remembered as a great builder-king. The prosperity ensured by his wars allowed Nebuchadnezzar to conduct great building projects in Babylon, and elsewhere in Mesopotamia. The modern image of Babylon is largely of the city as it was after Nebuchadnezzar's projects, during which he, among other work, rebuilt many of the city's religious buildings, including the Esagila and Etemenanki, repaired its current palace and constructed a brand new palace, and beautified its ceremonial centre through renovations to the city's Processional Street and the Ishtar Gate. As most of Nebuchadnezzar's inscriptions deal with his building projects, rather than military accomplishments, he was for a time seen by historians mostly as a builder, rather than a warrior.SourcesThere are very few cuneiform sources for the period between 594 BC and 557 BC, covering much of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar II, and the reigns of his three immediate successors; Amel-Marduk, Neriglissar and Labashi-Marduk. This lack of sources has the unfortunate effect that even though Nebuchadnezzar had the longest reign of all of them, less is confidently known of Nebuchadnezzar's reign than of the reigns of almost all the other Neo-Babylonian kings. Though the handful of cuneiform sources recovered, notably the Babylonian Chronicle, confirm some events of his reign, such as conflicts with the Kingdom of Judah, other events, such as the 586 BC destruction of Solomon's Temple and other potential military campaigns Nebuchadnezzar conducted, are not covered in any known cuneiform documents.As such, historical reconstructions of this period generally follow secondary sources in Hebrew, Greek and Latin to determine what events transpired at the time, in addition to contract tablets from Babylonia. Though using the sources written by later authors, many of them created several centuries after Nebuchadnezzar's time and often including their own cultural attitudes to the events and figures discussed, presents problems in and of itself, blurring the line between history and tradition, it is the only possible approach to gain insight into Nebuchadnezzar's reign.BackgroundAncestry and early lifeNebuchadnezzar was the eldest son of Nabopolassar (626–605 BC), the founder of the Neo-Babylonian Empire. This is confirmed by Nabopolassar's inscriptions, which explicitly name Nebuchadnezzar as his 'eldest son', as well as inscriptions from Nebuchadnezzar's reign, which refer to him as the 'first' or 'chief son' of Nabopolassar, and as Nabopolassar's 'true' or 'legitimate heir'. The Neo-Babylonian Empire was founded through Nabopolassar's rebellion, and later war, against the Neo-Assyrian Empire, which liberated Babylonia after nearly a century of Assyrian control. The war resulted in the complete destruction of Assyria, and the Neo-Babylonian Empire, which rose in its place, was powerful, but hastily built and politically unstable.As Nabopolassar never clarified his ancestry in lineage in any of his inscriptions, his origin is not entirely clear. Subsequent historians have variously identified Nabopolassar as a Chaldean, an Assyrian or a Babylonian. Although no evidence conclusively confirms him as being of Chaldean origin, the term 'Chaldean dynasty' is frequently used by modern historians for the royal family he founded, and the term 'Chaldean Empire' remains in use as an alternate historiographical name for the Neo-Babylonian Empire.Nabopolassar appears to, regardless of his ethnic origin, have been strongly connected to the city of Uruk, located south of Babylon. It is possible that he was a member of its ruling elite before becoming king and there is a growing body of evidence that Nabopolassar's family originated in Uruk, for instance that Nebuchadnezzar's daughters lived in the city. In 2007, Michael Jursa advanced the theory that Nabopolassar was a member of a prominent political family in Uruk, whose members are attested since the reign of Esarhaddon (681–669 BC). To support his theory, Jursa pointed to how documents describe how the grave and body of 'Kudurru', a deceased governor of Uruk, was desecrated due to the anti-Assyrian activities of Kudurru's two sons, Nabu-shumu-ukin and a son whose name is mostly missing. The desecration went so far as to drag Kudurru's body through the streets of Uruk. Kudurru can be identified with Nebuchadnezzar (Nabû-kudurri-uṣur, 'Kudurru' simply being a common and shortened nickname), a prominent official in Uruk who served as its governor under the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal (669–631 BC) in the 640s BC. In Assyrian tradition, the desecration of a dead body showed that the deceased individual and their surviving family were traitors and enemies of the state, and that they had to be completely eradicated, serving to punish them even after death. The name of the son whose name is unpreserved in the letter ended with either ahi, nâsir or uṣur, and the remaining traces can fit with the name Nabû-apla-uṣur, meaning that Nabopolassar could be the other son mentioned in the letter and thus a son of Kudurru.Strengthening this connection is that Nebuchadnezzar II is attested very early during his father's reign, from 626/625 to 617 BC, as high priest of the Eanna temple in Uruk, where he is often attested under the nickname 'Kudurru'. Nebuchadnezzar must have been made high priest at a very young age, considering that his year of death, 562 BC, is 64 years after 626 BC. The original Kudurru's second son, Nabu-shumu-ukin, also appears to be attested as a prominent general under Nabopolassar, and the name was also used by Nebuchadnezzar II for one of his sons, possibly honoring his dead uncle.NameNebuchadnezzar II's name in Akkadian was Nabû-kudurri-uṣur, meaning 'Nabu, watch over my heir'. The name was often interpreted in earlier scholarship as 'Nabu, protect the boundary', given that the word kudurru can also mean 'boundary' or 'line'. Modern historians support the 'heir' interpretation over the 'boundary' interpretation in terms of this name. There is no reason to believe that the Babylonians intended the name to be difficult to interpret or to have a double meaning.Nabû-kudurri-uṣur is typically anglicised to 'Nebuchadnezzar', following how name is most commonly rendered in Hebrew and Greek, particularly in most of the Bible. In Hebrew, the name was rendered as נְבוּכַדְנֶאצַּר (Nəḇūḵaḏneʾṣṣar) and in Greek it was rendered as Ναβουχοδονόσορ (Nabouchodonosor). Some scholars, such as Donald Wiseman, prefer the anglicisation 'Nebuchadrezzar', with an 'r' rather than an 'n', following the assumption that 'Nebuchadnezzar' is a later, corrupted form of the contemporary Nabû-kudurri-uṣur. The alternate anglicisation 'Nebuchadrezzar' derives from how the name is rendered in the books of Jeremiah and Ezekiel, נְבוּכַדְרֶאצַּר (Nəḇūḵaḏreʾṣṣar), a more faithful transliteration of the original Akkadian name. The Assyriologist Adrianus van Selms suggested in 1974 that the variant with an 'n' rather than an 'r' was a rude nickname, deriving from an Akkadian rendition like Nabû-kūdanu-uṣur, which means 'Nabu, protect the mule', though there is no concrete evidence for this idea. Van Selms believed that a nickname like that could derive from Nebuchadnezzar's early reign, which was plagued by political instability.Nebuchadnezzar II's name, Nabû-kudurri-uṣur, was identical to the name of his distant predecessor, Nebuchadnezzar I ( 1125–1104 BC), who ruled more than five centuries before Nebuchadnezzar II's time. Like Nebuchadnezzar II, Nebuchadnezzar I was a renowned warrior-king, who appeared in a time of political upheaval and defeated the forces of Babylon's enemies, in Nebuchadnezzar I's case the Elamites. Although theophoric names using the god Nabu are common in texts from the early Neo-Babylonian Empire, the name Nebuchadnezzar is relatively rare, only being mentioned four times with certainty. Though there is no evidence that Nabopolassar named his son after Nebuchadnezzar I, Nabopolassar was knowledgeable in history and actively worked to connect his rule to the rule of the Akkadian Empire, which preceded him by nearly two thousand years. The significance of his son and heir bearing the name of one of Babylon's greatest kings would not have been lost on Nabopolassar.If Jursa's theory concerning Nabopolassar's origin is correct, it is alternatively possible that Nebuchadnezzar II was named after his grandfather of the same name, as the Babylonians employed patronymics, rather than after the previous king.Nebuchadnezzar as crown princeNebuchadnezzar's military career began in the reign of his father, though little information survives. Based on a letter sent to the temple administration of the Eanna temple, it appears that Nebuchadnezzar participated in his father's campaign to take the city of Harran in 610 BC. Harran was the seat of Ashur-uballit II, who had rallied what remained of the Assyrian army and ruled what was left of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. The Babylonian victory in the Harran campaign, and the defeat of Ashur-uballit, in 609 BC marked the end of the ancient Assyrian monarchy, which would never be restored. According to the Babylonian Chronicle, Nebuchadnezzar also commanded an army in an unspecified mountainous region for several months in 607 BC.In the war against the Babylonians and Medes, Assyria had allied with Pharaoh Psamtik I of Egypt, who had been interested in ensuring Assyria's survival so that Assyria could remain as a buffer state between his own kingdom and the Babylonian and Median kingdoms. After the fall of Harran, Psamtik's successor, Pharaoh Necho II, personally led a large army into former Assyrian lands to turn the tide of the war and restore the Neo-Assyrian Empire, even though it was more or less a lost cause as Assyria had already collapsed. As Nabopolassar was occupied with fighting the Kingdom of Urartu in the north, the Egyptians took control of the Levant largely unopposed, capturing territories as far north as the city of Carchemish in Syria, where Necho established his base of operations.Nebuchadnezzar's greatest victory from his time as crown prince came at the Battle of Carchemish in 605 BC, which put an end to Necho's campaign in the Levant by inflicting a crushing defeat on the Egyptians. Nebuchadnezzar had been the sole commander of the Babylonian army at this battle as his father had chosen to stay in Babylon, perhaps on account of illness. Necho's forces were completely annihilated by Nebuchadnezzar's army, with Babylonian sources claiming that not a single Egyptian escaped alive. The account of the battle in the Babylonian Chronicle reads as follows:The story of Nebuchadnezzar's victory at Carchemish reverberated through history, appearing in many later ancient accounts, including in the Book of Jeremiah and the Books of Kings in the Bible. It is possible to conclude, based on subsequent geopolitics, that the victory resulted in all of Syria and Palestine coming under the control of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, a feat which the Assyrians under Tiglath-Pileser III (745–727 BC) only accomplished after five years of protracted military campaigns. The defeat of Egypt at Carchemish ensured that the Neo-Babylonian Empire would grow to become the major power of the ancient Near East, and the uncontested successor of the Neo-Assyrian Empire.ReignAccession to the throneNabopolassar died just a few weeks after Nebuchadnezzar's victory at Carchemish. At this point in time, Nebuchadnezzar was still away on his campaign against the Egyptians, having chased the retreating Egyptian forces to the region around the city of Hamath. The news of Nabopolassar's death reached Nebuchadnezzar's camp on 8 Abu (late July), and Nebuchadnezzar quickly arranged affairs with the Egyptians and rushed back to Babylon, where he was proclaimed king on 1 Ulūlu (mid-August). The speed in which Nebuchadnezzar returned to Babylon might be due to the threat that one of his brothers (two are known by name: Nabu-shum-lishir and Nabu-zer-ushabshi) could claim the throne in his absence. Though Nebuchadnezzar had been recognised as the eldest son and heir by Nabopolassar, Nabu-shum-lishir, Nabopolassar's second-born son, had been recognised as 'his equal brother', a dangerously vague title. Despite these possible fears, there were no attempts made at usurping his throne at this time.One of Nebuchadnezzar's first acts as king was to bury his father. Nabopolassar was laid in a huge coffin, adorned with ornamented gold plates and fine dresses with golden beads, which was then placed within a small palace he had constructed in Babylon. Shortly thereafter, before the end of the month in which he had been crowned, Nebuchadnezzar returned to Syria to resume his campaign. The Babylonian Chronicle records that 'he marched about victoriously' (meaning that he faced little to no resistance), returning to Babylon after several months of campaigning. The Syrian campaign, though it resulted in a certain amount of plunder, was not a complete success in that it did not ensure Nebuchadnezzar's grasp on the region. He had seemingly failed to inspire fear, given that none of the westernmost states in the Levant swore fealty to him and paid tribute.Early military campaignsThough little information survives concerning them, the Babylonian Chronicle preserves brief accounts of Nebuchadnezzar's military activities in his first eleven years as king. In 604 BC, Nebuchadnezzar campaigned in the Levant once again, conquering the city of Ashkelon. According to the Babylonian Chronicle, Ashkelon's king was captured and taken to Babylon, and the city was plundered and levelled to the ground. Modern excavations at Ashkelon have confirmed that the city was more or less destroyed at this point in time. The Ashkelon campaign was preceded by a campaign in Syria, which was more successful than Nebuchadnezzar's first, resulting in oaths of fealty from the rulers of Phoenicia.In 603 BC, Nebuchadnezzar campaigned in a land whose name is not preserved in the surviving copy of the chronicle. The chronicle records that this campaign was extensive, given that the account mentions the construction of large siege towers and a siege of a city, the name of which does not survive either. Anson Rainey speculated in 1975 that the city taken was Gaza, whereas Nadav Na'aman thought in 1992 that it was Kummuh in south-eastern Anatolia. In the second half of the 5th century BC, some documents mentioned the towns Isqalanu (the name derived from Ashkelon) and Hazzatu (the name possibly derived from Gaza) near the city of Nippur, indicating that deportees from both of these cities lived near Nippur, and as such possibly that they had been captured at around the same time.In both 602 BC and 601 BC, Nebuchadnezzar campaigned in the Levant, though little information survives beyond that a 'vast' amount of booty was brought from the Levant to Babylonia in 602 BC. On account of the entry for 602 BC also referring to Nabu-shum-lishir, Nebuchadnezzar's younger brother, in a fragmentary and unclear context, it is possible that Nabu-shum-lishir led a revolt against his brother in an attempt to usurp the throne in that year, especially since he is no longer mentioned in any sources after 602 BC. The damage to the text however makes this idea speculative and conjectural.In the 601 BC campaign, Nebuchadnezzar departed from the Levant and then marched into Egypt. Despite the defeat at Carchemish in 605 BC, Egypt still had a great amount of influence in the Levant, even though the region was ostensibly under Babylonian rule. Thus, a campaign against Egypt was logical in order to assert Babylonian dominance, and also carried enormous economic and propagandistic benefits, but it was also risky and ambitious. The path into Egypt was difficult, and the lack of secure control of either side of the Sinai Desert could spell disaster. Nebuchadnezzar's invasion of Egypt did fail–the Babylonian Chronicle states that both the Egyptian and Babylonian armies suffered a huge number of casualties. Though Egypt was not conquered, the campaign did result in momentarily curbing Egyptian interest in the Levant, given that Necho II gave up his ambitions in the region. In 599 BC, Nebuchadnezzar marched his army into the Levant and then attacked and raided the Arabs in the Syrian desert. Though apparently successful, it is unclear what the achievements gained in this campaign were.In 598 BC, Nebuchadnezzar campaigned against the Kingdom of Judah, succeeding in capturing the city of Jerusalem. Judah represented a prime target of Babylonian attention given that it was at the epicenter of competition between Babylon and Egypt. By 601 BC, Judah's king, Jehoiakim, had begun to openly challenge Babylonian authority, counting on that Egypt would lend support to his cause. Nebuchadnezzar's first, 598–597 BC, assault on Jerusalem is recorded in the Bible, but also in the Babylonian Chronicle, which describes it as follows:Jehoiakim had died during Nebuchadnezzar's siege and been replaced by his son, Jeconiah, who was captured and taken to Babylon, with his uncle Zedekiah installed in his place as king of Judah. Jeconiah is recorded as being alive in Babylonia thereafter, with records as late as 592 or 591 BC listing him among the recipients of food at Nebuchadnezzar's palace and still referring to him as the 'king of the land of Judah'.In 597 BC, the Babylonian army departed for the Levant again, but appears to not have engaged in any military activities as they turned back immediately after reaching the Euphrates. The following year, Nebuchadnezzar marched his army along the Tigris river to do battle with the Elamites, but no actual battle happened as the Elamites retreated out of fear once Nebuchadnezzar was a day's march away. In 595 BC, Nebuchadnezzar stayed at home in Babylon but soon had to face a rebellion against his rule there, though he defeated the rebels, with the chronicle stating that the king 'put his large army to the sword and conquered his foe.' Shortly thereafter, Nebuchadnezzar again campaigned in the Levant and secured large amounts of tribute. In the last year recorded in the chronicle, 594 BC, Nebuchadnezzar campaigned in the Levant yet again.There were several years without any noteworthy military activity at all. Notably, Nebuchadnezzar spent all of 600 BC in Babylon, when the chronicle excuses the king by stating that he stayed in Babylon to 'refit his numerous horses and chariotry'. Some of the years when Nebuchadnezzar was victorious can also hardly be considered real challenges. Raiding the Arabs in 599 BC was not a major military accomplishment and the victory over Judah and the retreat of the Elamites were not secured on the battlefield. It thus appears that Nebuchadnezzar achieved little military success after the failure of his invasion of Egypt. Nebuchadnezzar's poor military record had dangerous geopolitical consequences. If the biblical record is to be believed, in Zedekiah's fourth year as king of Judah (594 BC), the kings of Ammon, Edom, Moab, Sidon and Tyre met in Jerusalem to deal with the possibility of throwing off Babylonian control. Evidence that Babylonian control was beginning to unravel is also clear from contemporary Babylonian records, such as the aforementioned rebellion in Babylonia itself, as well as records of a man being executed in 594 BC at Borspippa for 'breaking his oath to the king'. The oath-breaking was serious enough that the judge in the trial was Nebuchadnezzar himself. It is also possible that Babylonian–Median relations were becoming strained, with records of a 'Median defector' being housed in Nebuchadnezzar's palace and some inscriptions indicating that the Medes were beginning to be seen as 'enemies'. By 594 BC, the failure of the Egyptian invasion, and the lacklustre state of Nebuchadnezzar's other campaigns, loomed high. According to the Assyriologist Israel Ephʿal, Babylon at this time was seen by its contemporaries more like a 'paper tiger' (i. e. an ineffectual threat) than a great empire, like Assyria just a few decades prior.Destruction of JerusalemFrom his appointment as king of Judah, Zedekiah waited for the opportune moment to throw off Babylonian control. After Pharaoh Necho II's death in 595 BC, Egyptian intervention in affairs in the Levant increased once again under his successors, Psamtik II (595–589 BC) and Apries (589–570 BC), who both worked to encourage anti-Babylonian rebellions. It is possible that the Babylonian failure to invade Egypt in 601 BC helped inspire revolts against the Babylonian Empire. The outcome of these efforts was Zedekiah's open revolt against Nebuchadnezzar's authority. Unfortunately, no cuneiform sources are preserved from this time and the only known account of the fall of Judah is the biblical account.In 589 BC, Zedekiah refused to pay tribute to Nebuchadnezzar, and he was closely followed in this by Ithobaal III, the king of Tyre. In response to Zedekiah's uprising, Nebuchadnezzar conquered and destroyed the Kingdom of Judah in 586 BC, one of the great achievements of his reign. The campaign, which probably ended in the summer of 586 BC, resulted in the plunder and destruction of the city of Jerusalem, a permanent end to Judah, and it led to the Babylonian captivity, as the Jews were captured and deported to Babylonia. Archaeological excavations confirm that Jerusalem and the surrounding area was destroyed and depopulated. It is possible that the intensity of the destruction carried out by Nebuchadnezzar at Jerusalem and elsewhere in the Levant was due to the implementation of something akin to a scorched earth-policy, aimed at stopping Egypt from gaining a foothold there.Some Jewish administration was allowed to remain in the region under the governor Gedaliah, governing from Mizpah under close Babylonian monitoring. According to the Bible, and the 1st-century AD Jewish historian Flavius Josephus, Zedekiah attempted to flee after resisting the Babylonians, but was captured at Jericho and suffered a terrible fate. According to the narrative, Nebuchadnezzar wanted to make an example out of him given that Zedekiah was not an ordinary vassal, but a vassal directly appointed by Nebuchadnezzar. As such, Zedekiah was supposedly taken to Riblah in northern Syria, where he had to watch his sons being executed before having his eyes gouged out and sent to be imprisoned in Babylon.Per the Books of Kings in the Bible, the campaign against Judah was longer than typical Mesopotamian wars, with the siege of Jerusalem lasting 18–30 months (depending on the calculation), rather than the typical length of less than a year. Whether the unusual length of the siege indicates that the Babylonian army was weak, unable to break into the city for more than a year, or that Nebuchadnezzar by this time had succeeded in stabilising his rule in Babylonia and could thus wage war patiently without being pressured by time to escalate the siege, is not certain.Later military campaignsIt is possible that the Egyptians took advantage of the Babylonians being preoccupied with besieging Jerusalem. Herodotus describes Pharaoh Apries as campaigning in the Levant, taking the city of Sidon and fighting the Tyrians, which indicates a renewed Egyptian invasion of the Levant. Apries is unlikely to have been as successful as Herodotus describes, given that it is unclear how the Egyptian navy would have defeated the superior navies of the Phoenician cities, and even if some cities had been taken, they must have shortly thereafter fallen into Babylonian hands again. Tyre had rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar at around the same time as Judah, and Nebuchadnezzar moved to retake the city after his successful subduing of the Jews.The biblical Book of Ezekiel describes Tyre in 571 BC as if it had been recently captured by the Babylonian army. The supposed length of the siege, 13 years, is only given by Flavius Josephus, and is subject to debate among modern scholars. Josephus's account of Nebuchadnezzar's reign is obviously not entirely historic, as he describes Nebuchadnezzar as, five years after the destruction of Jerusalem, invading Egypt, capturing the Pharaoh and appointing another Pharaoh in his place. Josephus states that Nebuchadnezzar besieged Tyre in the seventh year of 'his' reign, though it is unclear whether 'his' in this context refers to Nebuchadnezzar or to Ithobaal III of Tyre. If it refers to Nebuchadnezzar, a siege begun in 598 BC and lasting for thirteen years, later simultaneously with the siege of Jerusalem, is unlikely to have gone unmentioned in Babylonian records. If the seventh year of Ithobaal is intended, the beginning of the siege may conjecturally be placed after Jerusalem's fall. If the siege lasting 13 years is taken at face value, the siege would then not have ended before 573 or 572 BC. The supposed length of the siege can be ascribed to the difficulty in besieging the city: Tyre was located on an island 800 metres from the coast, and could not be taken without naval support. Though the city withstood numerous sieges, it would not be captured until Alexander the Great's siege in 332 BC.In the end, the siege was resolved without a need of battle and did not result in the Tyre being conquered. It seems Tyre's king and Nebuchadnezzar came to an agreement for Tyre to continue to be ruled by vassal kings, though probably under heavier Babylonian control than before. Documents from Tyre near the end of Nebuchadnezzar's reign demonstrate that the city had become a centre for Babylonian military affairs in the region. According to later Jewish tradition, it is possible that Ithobaal III was deposed and taken as a prisoner to Babylon, with another king, Baal II, proclaimed by Nebuchadnezzar in his place.It is possible that Nebuchadnezzar campaigned against Egypt in 568 BC, given that a fragmentary Babylonian inscription, given the modern designation BM 33041, from that year records the word 'Egypt' as well as possibly traces of the name 'Amasis' (the name of the then incumbent Pharaoh, Amasis II, 570–526 BC). A stele of Amasis, also fragmentary, may also describe a combined naval and land attack by the Babylonians. The evidence for this campaign is scant however, and the readings of the relevant inscriptions are not certain. If Nebuchadnezzar did campaign against Egypt again, he was unsuccessful again, given that Egypt did not come under Babylonian rule.Nebuchadnezzar's campaigns in the Levant, most notably those directed towards Jerusalem and Tyre, completed the Neo-Babylonian Empire's transformation from a rump state of the Neo-Assyrian Empire to the new dominant power of the ancient Near East. Still, Nebuchadnezzar's military accomplishments can be questioned, given that the borders of his empire, by the end of his reign, had not noticeably increased in size and that his main rival, Egypt, had not submitted to his rule. Even after a reign of several decades, Nebuchadnezzar's greatest victory remained his victory over the Egyptians at Carchemish in 605 BC, before he even became king.Building projectsThe Babylonian king was traditionally a builder and restorer, and as such large-scale building projects were important as a legitimizing factor for Babylonian rulers. Nebuchadnezzar extensively expanded and rebuilt his capital city of Babylon and the most modern historical and archaeological interpretations of the city reflect it as it appeared after Nebuchadnezzar's construction projects. The projects were made possible through the prospering economy during Nebuchadnezzar's reign, sustained by his conquests. His building inscriptions record work done to numerous temples, notably the restoration of the Esagila, the main temple of Babylon's national deity Marduk, and the completion of the Etemenanki, a great ziggurat dedicated to Marduk.Extensive work was also conducted on civil and military structures. Among the most impressive efforts was the work done surrounding the city's northern ceremonial entrance, the Ishtar Gate. These projects included restoration work on the South Palace, inside the city walls, the construction of a completely new North Palace, on the other side of the walls facing the gate, as well as the restoration of Babylon's Processional Street, which led through the gate, and of the gate itself. The ruins of Nebuchadnezzar's North Palace are poorly preserved and as such its structure and appearance are not entirely understood. Nebuchadnezzar also constructed a third palace, the Summer Palace, built some distance north of the inner city walls in the northernmost corner of the outer walls.The restored Ishtar Gate was decorated with blue and yellow glazed bricks and depictions of bulls (symbols of the god Adad) and dragons (symbols of the god Marduk). Similar bricks were used for the walls surrounding the Processional Street, which also featured depictions of lions (symbols of the goddess Ishtar). Babylon's Processional Street, the only such street yet excavated in Mesopotamia, ran along the eastern walls of the South Palace and exited the inner city walls at the Ishtar Gate, running past the North Palace. To the south, this street went by the Etemenanki, turning to the west and going over a bridge constructed either under the reign of Nabopolassar or Nebuchadnezzar. Some of the bricks of the Processional Street bear the name of the Neo-Assyrian king Sennacherib (705–681 BC) on their underside, perhaps indicating that construction of the street had begun already during his reign, but the fact that the upper side of the bricks all bear the name of Nebuchadnezzar suggests that construction of the street was completed under Nebuchadnezzar's reign. Glazed bricks such as the ones used in the Procession Street were also used in the throne room of the South Palace, which was decorated with depictions of lions and tall, stylized palm trees.Nebuchadnezzar also directed building efforts on the city of Borsippa, with several of his inscriptions recording restoration work on that city's temple, the Ezida, dedicated to the god Nabu. Additionally, Nebuchadnezzar also restored the ziggurat of the Ezida, the E-urme-imin-anki, and also worked on the temple of Gula, Etila, as well as numerous other temples and shrines in the city. Nebuchadnezzar also repaired Borsippa's walls.Other great building projects by Nebuchadnezzar include the Nar-Shamash, a canal to bring water from the Euphrates close to the city of Sippar, and the Median Wall, a large defensive structure built to defend Babylonia against incursions from the north. The Median Wall was one of two walls built to protect Babylonia's northern border. Further evidence that Nebuchadnezzar believed the north to be the most likely point of attack for his enemies comes from that he fortified the walls of northern cities, such as Babylon, Borsippa and Kish, but left the walls of southern cities, such as Ur and Uruk, as they were. Nebuchadnezzar also began work on the Royal Canal, also known as Nebuchadnezzar's Canal, a great canal linking the Euphrates to the Tigris which in time completely transformed the agriculture of the region, but the structure was not completed until the reign of Nabonidus, who ruled as the last king of the Neo-Babylonian Empire from 556 to 539 BC.Death and successionNebuchadnezzar died at Babylon in 562 BC. The last known tablet dated to Nebuchadnezzar's reign, from Uruk, is dated to the same day, 7 October, as the first known tablet of his successor, Amel-Marduk, from Sippar. Amel-Marduk's administrative duties probably began before he became king, during the last few weeks or months of his father's reign when Nebuchadnezzar was ill and dying. Having ruled for 43 years, Nebuchadnezzar's reign was the longest of his dynasty and he would be remembered favourably by the Babylonians.Amel-Marduk's accession does not appear to have gone smoothly. Amel-Marduk was not the eldest living son of Nebuchadnezzar and the reason why he was picked as crown prince is not known. The choice is especially strange given that some sources suggest that the relationship between Nebuchadnezzar and Amel-Marduk was particularly poor, with one surviving text describing both as parties in some form of conspiracy and accusing one of them (the text is too fragmentary to determine which one) of failing in the most important duties of Babylonian kingship through exploiting Babylon's populace and desecrating its temples. Amel-Marduk also at one point appears to have been imprisoned by his father, possibly on account of the Babylonian aristocracy having proclaimed him as king while Nebuchadnezzar was away. It is possible that Nebuchadnezzar intended to replace Amel-Marduk as heir with another son, but died before doing so.In one of Nebuchadnezzar's late inscriptions, written more than forty years into his reign, he wrote that he had been chosen for the kingship by the gods before he was even born. Mesopotamian rulers typically only stressed divine legitimacy in this fashion when their actual legitimacy was questionable, a method often employed by usurpers. Given that Nebuchadnezzar at this point had been king for several decades and was the legitimate heir of his predecessor, the inscription is very strange, unless it was intended to help legitimize Nebuchadnezzar's successor, Amel-Marduk, who as a younger son and a former conspirator could be seen as politically problematic.Family and childrenNo surviving contemporary Babylonian documents provide the name of Nebuchadnezzar's wife. According to Berossus, her name was Amytis, daughter of Astyages, king of the Medes. Berossus writes that '[Nabopolassar] sent troops to the assistance of Astyages, the tribal chieftain and satrap of the Medes in order to obtain a daughter of Astyages, Amyitis, as wife for his son [Nebuchadnezzar]'. Though the ancient Greek historian Ctesias instead wrote that Amytis was the name of a daughter of Astyages who had married Cyrus I of Persia, it seems more likely that a Median princess would marry a member of the Babylonian royal family, considering the good relations established between the two during Nabopolassar's reign. Given that Astyages was still too young during Nabopolassar's reign to already have children, and was not yet king, it seems more probable that Amytis was Astyages's sister, and thus a daughter of his predecessor, Cyaxares. By marrying his son to a daughter of Cyaxares, Nebuchadnezzar's father Nabopolassar likely sought to seal the alliance between the Babylonians and the Medes. According to tradition, Nebuchadnezzar constructed the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, featuring exotic shrubs, vines and trees as well as artificial hills, watercourses and knolls, so that Amytis would feel less homesick for the mountains of Media. No archaeological evidence for these gardens has yet been found.Nebuchadnezzar had six known sons. Most of the sons, with the exceptions of Marduk-nadin-ahi and Eanna-sharra-usur, are attested very late in their father's reign. It is possible that they might have been the product of a second marriage and that they could have been born relatively late in Nebuchadnezzar's reign, possibly after his known daughters. The known sons of Nebuchadnezzar are:Marduk-nadin-ahi (Akkadian: Marduk-nādin-aḫi) – the earliest attested of Nebuchadnezzar's children, attested in a legal document, probably as an adult as he is described as being in charge of his own land, already in Nebuchadnezzar's third year as king (602/601 BC). Presumably Nebuchadnezzar's firstborn son, if not eldest child, and thus his legitimate heir. He is also attested very late in Nebuchadnezzar's reign, named as a 'royal prince' in a document recording the purchase of dates by Sin-mār-šarri-uṣur, his servant, in 563 BC. Eanna-sharra-usur (Akkadian: Eanna-šarra-uṣur) – named as a 'royal prince' among sixteen people in a document at Uruk from 587 BC recorded as receiving barley 'for the sick'. Amel-Marduk (Akkadian: Amēl-Marduk), originally named Nabu-shum-ukin (Nabû-šum-ukīn) – succeeded Nebuchadnezzar as king in 562 BC. His reign was marred with intrigues and he only ruled for two years before being murdered and usurped by his brother-in-law, Neriglissar. Later Babylonian sources mostly speak ill of his reign. Amel-Marduk is first attested, notably as crown prince, in a document 566 BC. Given that Amel-Marduk had an older brother in Marduk-nadin-ahi, alive as late as 563 BC, why he was named crown prince is not clear.Marduk-shum-usur (Akkadian: Marduk-šum-uṣur or Marduk-šuma-uṣur) – named as a 'royal prince' in documents from Nebuchadnezzar's 564 BC and 562 BC years, recording payments by his scribe to the Ebabbar temple in Sippar.Mushezib-Marduk (Akkadian: Mušēzib-Marduk) – named as a 'royal prince' once in a contract tablet from 563 BC. Marduk-nadin-shumi (Akkadian: Marduk-nādin-šumi) – named as a 'royal prince' once in a contract tablet from 563 BC. Three of Nebuchadnezzar's daughters are known by name:Kashshaya (Akkadian: Kaššaya) – attested in several economic documents from Nebuchadnezzar's reign as 'the king's daughter'. Her name is of unclear origin; it might be derived from the word kaššû (kassite). Kashshaya is attested from contemporary texts as a resident of (and landowner in) Uruk. Kashshaya is typically, although speculatively, identified as the daughter of Nebuchadnezzar who married Neriglissar.Innin-etirat (Akkadian: Innin-ēṭirat) – attested as 'the king's daughter' in a 564 BC document which records her granting mār-banûtu status ('status of a free man') to a slave by the name Nabû-mukkê-elip. The document in question was written at Babylon, but names including the divine prefix Innin are almost unique to Uruk, suggesting that she was a resident of that city.Ba'u-asitu (Akkadian: Ba'u-asītu) – attested as the owner of a piece of real estate in an economic document. The precise reading and meaning of her name is somewhat unclear. Paul-Alain Beaulieu, who in 1998 published the translated text which confirms her existence, believes that her name is best interpreted as meaning 'Ba'u is a/the physician'. The document was written at Uruk, where Ba'u-asitu is presumed to have lived. It is possible that one of Nebuchadnezzar's daughters married the high official Nabonidus. Marriage to a daughter of Nebuchadnezzar could explain how Nabonidus could became king, and also explain why certain later traditions, such as the Book of Daniel in the Bible, describe Nabonidus's son, Belshazzar, as Nebuchadnezzar's son (descendant). Alternatively, these later traditions might instead derive from royal propaganda. The ancient Greek historian Herodotus names the 'last great queen' of the Babylonian Empire as 'Nitocris', though that name (nor any other name) is not attested in contemporary Babylonian sources. Herodotus's description of Nitocris contains a wealth of legendary material that makes it difficult to determine whether he uses the name to refer to Nabonidus's wife or mother, but William H. Shea proposed in 1982 that Nitocris may tentatively be identified as the name of Nabonidus's wife and Belshazzar's mother.LegacyAssessment by historiansBecause of the scarcity of sources, assessment by historians of Nebuchadnezzar's character and the nature of his reign have differed considerably over time. He has typically been regarded as the greatest and most prestigious king of the Neo-Babylonian Empire.Since military activity was not a major issue described in the inscriptions of any Neo-Babylonian king regardless of their actual military accomplishments, in sharp contrast to the inscriptions of their Neo-Assyrian predecessors, Nebuchadnezzar's own inscriptions talk very little about his wars. Out of the fifty or so known inscriptions by the king, only a single one deals with military action, and in this case only small-scale conflicts in the Lebanon region. Many Assyriologists, such as Wolfram von Soden in 1954, thus initially assumed that Nebuchadnezzar had mainly been a builder-king, devoting his energy and efforts to building and restoring his country. A major change in evaluations of Nebuchadnezzar came with the publication of the tablets of the Babylonian Chronicle by Donald Wiseman in 1956, which cover the geopolitical events of Nebuchadnezzar's first eleven years as king. From the publication of these tablets and onwards, historians have shifted to perceiving Nebuchadnezzar as a great warrior, devoting special attention to the military achievements of his reign.According to the historian Josette Elayi, writing in 2018, Nebuchadnezzar is somewhat difficult to characterise on account of the scarcity of Babylonian source material. Elayi wrote, about Nebuchadnezzar, that 'He was a conqueror, even though reservations can be had about his military capabilities. There was no lack of statesmanlike qualities, given his success in building the Babylonian Empire. He was a great builder, who restored a country that for a long time had been devastated by war. That is roughly all we know about him because the Babylonian Chronicles and other texts say little about his personality.'In Jewish and biblical traditionThe Babylonian captivity initiated by Nebuchadnezzar came to an end with the fall of Babylon to the Achaemenid king Cyrus the Great in 539 BC. Within a year of their liberation, the captured Jews returned to their homeland. Their liberation did little to erase the memory of five decades of imprisonment and oppression. Instead, Jewish literary accounts ensured that accounts of the hardship endured by the Jews, as well as the monarch responsible for it, would be remembered for all time. The Book of Jeremiah calls Nebuchadnezzar a 'lion' and a 'destroyer of nations'.Nebuchadnezzar's story thus found its way into the Old Testament of the Bible. The Bible narrates how Nebuchadnezzar destroyed the Kingdom of Judah, besieged, plundered and destroyed Jerusalem, and how he took away the Jews in captivity, portraying him as a cruel enemy of the Jewish people. The Bible also portrays Nebuchadnezzar as the legitimate ruler of all the nations of the world, appointed to rule the world by God. As such, Judah, through divine ruling, should have obeyed Nebuchadnezzar and not rebelled. Nebuchadnezzar is also depicted as carrying out death sentences pronounced by God, slaying two false prophets. Nebuchadnezzar's campaigns of conquest against other nations are portrayed as being in-line with God's will for Nebuchadnezzar's dominance.Despite Nebuchadnezzar's negative portrayal, he is notably referred with the epithet 'my servant' (i.e. God's servant) in three places in the Book of Jeremiah. Nebuchadnezzar's attack on the Kingdom of Judah is theologically justified in the Book of Jeremiah on account of its populace's 'disobedience' of God, and the king is called 'Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant'. The Book of Jeremiah also states that God has made all the Earth and given it to whom it seemed proper to give it to, deciding upon giving all of the lands of the world to 'Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant'. The Book of Jeremiah also prophesises Nebuchadnezzar's victory over Egypt, stating that 'Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant' will invade Egypt and 'deliver to death those appointed for death, and to captivity those appointed for captivity, and to the sword those appointed for the sword'. Given that Nebuchadnezzar was the enemy of what the Bible proclaims as God's chosen people, possibly the worst enemy they had faced until this point, there must be a special reason for referring to him with the epithet 'my servant'. Other uses of this epithet are usually limited to some of the most positively portrayed figures, such as the various prophets, Jacob (the symbol of the chosen people) and David (the chosen king). Klaas A. D. Smelik noted in 2004 that 'in the Hebrew Bible, there is no better company conceivable than these; at the same time, there is no candidate less likely for this title of honour than the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar'. It is possible that the epithet is a later addition, as it is missing in the Septuagint version of the Old Testament, perhaps added after Nabuchadnezzar began to be seen in a slightly more favourable light than immediately after Jerusalem's destruction. Alternatively, possible theological explanations include Nebuchadnezzar, despite his cruelty, being seen as an instrument in fulfilling God's universal plan, or perhaps that designating him as a 'servant' of God was to show that readers should not fear Nebuchadnezzar, but his true master, God.In the Book of Daniel, recognised by scholars as a work of historical fiction, Nebuchadnezzar is given a portrayal that differs considerably from his portrayal in the Book of Jeremiah. He is for the most part depicted as a merciless and despotic ruler. The king has a nightmare, and asks his wisemen, including Daniel and his three companions Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, to interpret the dream, but refuses to state the dream's contents. When the servants protest, Nebuchadnezzar sentences all of them (including Daniel and his companions) to death. By the end of the story, when Daniel successfully interpreted the dream, Nebuchadnezzar is nevertheless shown to be very grateful, showering Daniel with gifts, making him the governor of the 'province of Babylon' and making him the chief of the kingdoms' wisemen. A second story again casts Nebuchadnezzar as a tyrannical and pagan king, who after Daniel and his companions refuse to worship a newly erected golden statue sentences them to death through being thrown into a furnace. After Daniel interprets another dream as meaning that Nebuchadnezzar will lose his mind and live like an animal for seven years before being restored to his normal state, Nebuchadnezzar saves Daniel and his companions from their fiery fate and acknowledges Daniel's god as the 'lord of kings' and 'god of gods'. Though Nebuchadnezzar is also mentioned as acknowledging the Jewish god as the true god in other passages of the Book of Daniel, it is apparent that his supposed conversion to Judaism does not change his violent character, given that he proclaims that anyone who speaks amiss of God 'shall be cut in pieces and their houses shall be made a dunghill'. The portrayal of Nebuchadnezzar in the Book of Daniel is a fickle tyrant who is not particularly consistent in his faith, far from the typical 'servants of God' in other books of the Bible.Given that Nebuchadnezzar is referred to as the father of Belshazzar in the Book of Daniel, it is probable that this portrayal of Nebuchadnezzar, especially the story of his madness, was actually based on Belshazzar's real father, Nabonidus, the last king of the Neo-Babylonian Empire (556–539 BC). Separate Jewish and Hellenistic traditions exist concerning Nabonidus having been mad, and it is likely that this madness was simply reattributed to Nebuchadnezzar in the Book of Daniel through conflation. Some later traditions conflated Nebuchadnezzar with other rulers as well, such as the Assyrian Ashurbanipal (669–631 BC), the Persian Artaxerxes III (358–338 BC), the Seleucids Antiochus IV Epiphanes (175–164 BC) and Demetrius I Soter (161–150 BC) and the Armenian Tigranes the Great (95–55 BC). The apocryphal Book of Judith, which probably applies the name Nebuchadnezzar to Tigranes the Great of Armenia, refers to Nebuchadnezzar as a king of the Assyrians, rather than Babylonians, and demonstrates that Nebuchadnezzar was still viewed as an evil king, responsible for destroying Jerusalem, looting its temple, taking the Jews hostage in Babylon, and for the various misdeeds ascribed to him in later Jewish writings.TitlesIn most of his inscriptions, Nebuchadnezzar is typically only titled as 'Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, son of Nabopolassar, king of Babylon' or 'Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, the one who provides for Esagil and Ezida, son of Nabopolassar, king of Babylon'. In economic documents, Nebuchadnezzar is also ascribed the ancient title 'king of the Universe', and he sometimes also used the title 'king of Sumer and Akkad', used by all the Neo-Babylonian kings. Some inscriptions accord Nebuchadnezzar more elaborate version of his titles, including the following variant, attested in an inscription from Babylon:See alsoList of biblical figures identified in extra-biblical sources Nebuchadnezzar (Blake) – famous 19th-century painting depicting the biblical story of Nebuchadnezzar's madness Nabucco – 19th-century opera by Giuseppe Verdi based loosely on the biblical story of NebuchadnezzarNotesReferencesBibliographyWeb sources630s BC births 560s BC deaths Year of birth uncertain Year of death uncertain 7th-century BC Babylonian kings 6th-century BC Babylonian kings 6th-century BC biblical rulers 7th-century BC biblical rulers Babylonian kings Book of Daniel people Babylonian captivity Monarchs of the Hebrew Bible Chaldean kings Kings of the Universe Chaldean dynasty 7th-century BC religious leaders 6th-century BC religious leaders", "machine_text": "Nebuchadnezzar II was a king of Babylon who ruled from 605 BCE until his death in 562 BCE. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most powerful monarchs of the ancient world, known for his military conquests, vast building projects, and cultural achievements. Born into the Chaldean nobility, Nebuchadnezzar II became king after his father Nabopolassar led a successful rebellion against the Assyrian Empire. He quickly established himself as a strong leader, restoring Babylon to its former glory and expanding its territory through a series of military campaigns. Nebuchadnezzar II is perhaps best known for his conquest of Judah, which led to the destruction of the First Temple in Jerusalem and the exile of the Jewish people to Babylon. He also waged successful campaigns against the Egyptians, Elamites, and Persians, making Babylon the dominant power in the ancient Near East. In addition to his military exploits, Nebuchadnezzar II was a prolific builder. He oversaw the construction of some of Babylon's most impressive monuments, including the famous Hanging Gardens, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. He also built an extensive complex of palaces, fortresses, and temples, many of which still stand today. Nebuchadnezzar II was a patron of the arts, sponsoring numerous cultural and literary works during his reign. He is also credited with creating the Babylonian astronomical diaries, which provided important data on the movement of the stars and planets. Despite his impressive achievements, Nebuchadnezzar II's reign was not without its problems. He faced several rebellions from within his own empire, and his policies of forced deportation and religious intolerance were criticized by some.

It is endemic to New Caledonia, where it is an endangered species. Its populations are fragmented and are generally made up of scattered individuals. It is restricted to serpentine soils, often with high nickel levels, and its natural range is almost completely restricted to areas rich in nickel. Nickel mining in New Caledonia has consequently been a major cause of its decline.Araucaria rulei grows to around 30 meters in height, with long slender branches arranged symmetrically around the trunk, which extend horizontally and then turn upwards and branch out at the end, giving the tree an appearance sometimes compared to a chandelier. Male and female cones are produced on the same tree but on different branches, with branches at the top of the tree tending to produce female cones, while branches lower down make male cones. The cones stay on the tree for 2–3 years while the seeds ripen, which are around 3 cm long when mature. It is a slow-growing plant with slow regeneration capabilities, though in its natural environment it is tolerant of both very dry conditions and high winds which many other species of araucaria will not tolerate. The species was named for an Australian nurseryman John Rule, and is sometimes grown as an ornamental tree in Australia, with its large smooth leaves and the symmetrical dome shaped growth habit of mature trees considered attractive.Referencesrulei Endangered plants Trees of New Caledonia Endemic flora of New Caledonia Taxonomy articles created by Polbot", "machine_text": "Araucaria rulei is a species of conifer tree that is endemic to the temperate rainforests of Chile and Argentina. It is a member of the family Araucariaceae, which has a fossil record dating back to the Triassic period, over 200 million years ago. Araucaria rulei is also known by its common name, the Rauli tree, and is often referred to as a Chilean beech due to its similar appearance to the deciduous beech trees found in the southern hemisphere. The Rauli tree can grow up to 40 meters tall and 120 cm in diameter, and can live for up to 500 years. It has a straight trunk and a symmetrical crown of branches, with dark green needle-like leaves that can grow up to 5 cm long. The bark of the Rauli tree is smooth and dark, and the wood is highly prized for its durability and resistance to decay. The seeds of the Rauli tree are contained within large, woody cones that can reach up to 20 cm in length and 10 cm in diameter. The cones take up to two years to mature and when they do, they start to disintegrate, releasing the seeds that fall to the ground and are dispersed by the wind. The Rauli tree is an important species for both the timber industry and indigenous communities in Chile and Argentina who use the wood for construction, furniture, and fuel. The tree is also valued for its role in maintaining ecological diversity in the temperate rainforests of South America. The Rauli tree is under threat from deforestation, particularly in Argentina, where large areas of natural forest have been converted to livestock grazing and soybean cultivation. Efforts are being made to conserve the Rauli tree, including replanting programs and the establishment of protected areas. In Chile, the Rauli tree is considered a national treasure and is protected by law. The Rauli tree's long lifespan and slow growth rate mean that conservation efforts must be sustained over the long term to ensure the survival of this iconic species.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 12189782}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Organoiodine compound\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Organoiodine compounds are organic compounds that contain one or more carbon–iodine bonds.They occur widely in organic chemistry, but are relatively rare in nature.The thyroxine hormones are organoiodine compounds that are required for health and the reason for government-mandated iodization of salt.Structure, bonding, general properties Almost all organoiodine compounds feature iodide connected to one carbon center.These are usually classified as derivatives of I−. Some organoiodine compounds feature iodine in higher oxidation states.The C–I bond is the weakest of the carbon–halogen bonds.These bond strengths correlate with the electronegativity of the halogen, decreasing in the order F > Cl > Br > I.This periodic order also follows the atomic radius of halogens and the length of the carbon-halogen bond. For example, in the molecules represented by CH3X, where X is a halide, the carbon-X bonds have strengths, or bond dissociation energies, of 115, 83.7, 72.1, and 57.6 kcal/mol for X = fluoride, chloride, bromide, and iodide, respectively. Of the halides, iodide usually is the best leaving group. Because of the weakness of the C–I bond, samples of organoiodine compounds are often yellow due to an impurity of I2.A noteworthy aspect of organoiodine compounds is their high density, which arises from the high atomic weight of iodine. For example, one millilitre of methylene iodide weighs 3.325 g.Industrial applications Few organoiodine compounds are important industrially, at least in terms of large scale production. Iodide-containing intermediates are common in organic synthesis, because of the easy formation and cleavage of the C–I bond.Industrially significant organoiodine compounds, often used as disinfectants or pesticides, are iodoform (CHI3), methylene iodide (CH2I2), and methyl iodide (CH3I). Although methyl iodide is not an industrially important product, it is an important intermediate, being a transiently generated intermediate in the industrial production of acetic acid and acetic anhydride.The potential for methyl iodide to replace the ubiquitous dependence on methyl bromide as a soil fumigant has been considered, however limited information is available on environmental behavior of the former. Ioxynil (3,5-diiodo-4-hydroxybenzonitrile), which inhibits photosynthesis at photosystem II, is among the very few organoiodine herbicides. A member of the hydroxybenzonitrile herbicide class, ioxynil is an iodinated analog of the brominated herbicide, bromoxynil (3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybenzonitrile).Iodinated and brominated organic compounds are of concern as environmental contaminants owing to very limited information available on environment fate behavior. However, recent reports have shown promise in biological detoxification of these classes of contaminants. For example, Iodotyrosine deiodinase is a mammalian enzyme with the unusual function of aerobic reductive dehalogenation of iodine- or bromine-substituted organic substrates. Bromoxynil and ioxynil herbicides have been shown to undergo a variety of environmental transformations, including reductive dehalogenation by anaerobic bacteria.Polyiodoorganic compounds are sometimes employed as X-ray contrast agents, in fluoroscopy, a type of medical imaging. This application exploits the X-ray absorbing ability of the heavy iodine nucleus.A variety of agents are available commercially, many are derivatives of 1,3,5-triiodobenzene and contain about 50", "machine_text": "Organoiodine compounds are a class of chemical compounds that contain one or more iodine atoms and a carbon covalently bonded to each other. These compounds have found significant use in organic synthesis, pharmaceuticals, and materials science. They are also used as reagents in the laboratory and in some industrial processes. Organoiodine compounds can be prepared by direct iodination of organic compounds, or by substitution of halogens (usually chlorine or bromine) in existing organic compounds with iodine. The iodine atom in these compounds can be in its elemental state (as in iodobenzene) or in various organic functional groups such as alcohols, ethers, and amines. One of the most well-known and widely used organoiodine compounds is iodine monochloride (ICl). It is used as a reagent in organic synthesis, especially in the conversion of alcohols to alkyl chlorides. Another example is iodomethane (also known as methyl iodide), which is used as a methylating agent in organic synthesis and as a pesticide fumigant. Organoiodine compounds have also been explored for their potential medical applications. For example, radioiodinated compounds have been used as imaging agents in nuclear medicine for the detection and treatment of various diseases. Iodoform, a trihalomethane compound containing an iodine atom, has been used as an antiseptic for over a century. However, due to the toxicity and environmental impact of some organoiodine compounds, their use is regulated by various government agencies and organizations. Iodinated contrast agents used in medical imaging, for example, can sometimes cause adverse effects and are therefore carefully monitored. In conclusion, organoiodine compounds are a versatile class of compounds that have found widespread use in various fields including organic synthesis, pharmaceuticals, and materials science. While their use is regulated and sometimes restricted, further research and development may lead to the discovery of new applications for these compounds.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 20439768}

The two ships in the class may be described as a hybrid between a frigate and military transport ship with multiple role capabilities, with the capacity to be transformed from a combat ship with the firepower of a traditional frigate to a hospital ship within a day.Design The class is based on a frigate-like design, but built with an internal multipurpose deck (flex deck) and a stern vehicle ramp. The ships can serve as command platforms for a staff of 75 persons (naval or joint staff) with a containerized command and control centre, transport and base of operations for a company-sized landing force of some 200 soldiers with vehicles. Alternatively, the flex deck can be used for mine-laying operations with a capacity of some 300 mines, or be fitted out for mine-clearing operations and launch and recover mine detecting and clearing equipment via a retractable gantry crane, adjacent to the stern vehicle ramp, which also is used for launching and recovering the fast landing craft. Furthermore, the flex deck can support a containerized hospital or simply transport a number of ISO standard containers or some 55 vehicles, including up to seven MBTs. The ships can carry two landing craft, personnel (LCPs) (Storebro SB90E), two rigid hull inflatable boats and two EH101 helicopters.The ships have been designed by a joint team from The Royal Danish Navy (RDN), the Danish Defence Acquisition and Logistics Organization (DALO) and a group of contractors, primarily Odense Maritime Technology (OMT) to the Royal Danish Navy's requirements for a multi-mission frigate-like ship with an emphasis on flexibility.The ships are built to the naval standards of Det Norske Veritas (DNV GL), an international certification body and classification society, heavily utilizing STANAG.The design is built with the aim of a large margin for growth over life-cycle, to a relatively low cost of ownership, with open architecture for ease of upgrades, with a high degree of automation allowing smaller crews, and utilizing StanFlex modules that can be shared across several ship classes in service with the Royal Danish Navy.The hulls were built in highly competitive commercial shipyards using the latest development in the industries shipbuilding technology and cost-effective production procedures and processes. The outfitting and integration of sensor, communication and weapons systems was primarily carried out 'in-house' by the RDN and DALO.The standard weapons of the Absalon class can be supplemented through the use of StanFlex mission modules. A special weapons deck (nicknamed the 'Bathtub') is designed with five StanFlex module slots. Because of the Bathtub's position, only missile-firing weapons modules can be installed.History The ships were named after two brothers, Esbern Snare and archbishop Absalon, who led the naval campaigns in the 12th century against the Wends, a group of pagan Slavs in northern Germany.Production started at Odense Steel Shipyard on 30 April 2003, with the lead ship Absalon laid down on 28 November of that year. Esbern Snare followed on 24 March 2004; they were both launched later that year. They were delivered on 19 October 2004 and 17 April 2005 respectively, and commissioned on 10 January 2005 and 17 June 2005. At this point they had the StanFlex modules installed, but would have to wait until 2007 for full operational capability, with the installation of the 35mm CIWS, Mk32 torpedo launchers and Seagnat/SRBOC decoy systems.Among other upgrades the two ships of the Absalon class were fitted with the newer Terma Scanter 6002 to replace the Scanter 2001 in 2020.For political reasons, the ships were originally launched as 'Flexible support ships' to avoid antagonising Russia after the end of the cold war. On the 16th of October 2020, both ships were reclassed as ASW-frigates. Both ships will be upgraded with towed array sonars in addition to the existing, hull-mounted sonar and the Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk helicopters will be equipped with dipping sonars, sonobuoys and torpedoes.

The term 'sherds' refers to broken pieces of pottery or other ceramic material that are often found in archaeological excavations. The McClelland sherd, in particular, was discovered in 1973 during an archaeological survey of the McClelland Park site in Tucson, Arizona. The McClelland sherd is believed to date back to the prehistoric Hohokam culture, which flourished in the region from around 200 BCE to 1500 CE. The Hohokam were known for their sophisticated irrigation systems and their sophisticated pottery techniques. The McClelland sherd is one of the finest examples of this pottery, featuring intricate designs and an unusual black-on-red color scheme. The sherd measures about 8 cm in length and 7 cm in width. It is decorated with a series of interlocking geometrical patterns that are typical of the Hohokam style. The design is created by using a technique called 'negative painting,' in which the background of the pottery is painted black and the pattern is left unpainted, resulting in a striking contrast. The McClelland sherd has been studied in detail by archaeologists and art historians, who have used it to better understand the Hohokam culture and their artistic traditions. The sherd is now on display at the Arizona State Museum in Tucson, where visitors can view this remarkable artifact and learn more about the rich history of the region.

He was born in Claines, near Worcester, the son of James Dyson Perrins, the owner of the LeaPerrins Worcestershire sauce factory and the grandson of William Perrins, co-originator of the LeaPerrins secret recipe.Biography He was educated at Charterhouse School and The Queen's College, Oxford, and then served in the Highland Light Infantry. After the death of his father, he took over management of LeaPerrins. His father had also been a director of Royal Worcester Porcelain Factory, and Charles followed him, becoming a director in 1891. He became chairman in 1901, and supported the factory financially. He bought the company outright in 1934 and ensured its continuity from his own fortune, until it could be taken public in 1954.In 1927, he purchased the Royal Worcester Porcelain Factory's historic ceramics collection for a price above market value, to assist the firm's cashflow. In 1946, he established the Perrins Trust to unite the factory museum collection and his own private holdings of Royal Worcester and ensure their survival. After his death, his widow established the 'Dyson Perrins Museum' at the factory site to house the collection. It is now called 'The Museum of Royal Worcester' (previously 'Worcester Porcelain Museum').Perrins lived in Malvern for most of his life and amongst his many charitable deeds in Worcestershire was the endowment of Dyson Perrins Church of England Academy in Malvern. He served as Mayor of Worcester for 1897–98 and as High Sheriff of Worcestershire for 1899–1900.He was a major benefactor of the Royal Grammar School, Worcester, and endowed new buildings including Perrins Hall (1914) named after his father, an old boy. The school organ is in this building and is played regularly at assemblies. He became a Six Master and chairman of the governors of that school until the 1950s. His portrait by A. Hacker c. 1907 hangs in the hall.In Oxford, he funded the building of the Dyson Perrins Laboratory, which was the main centre for research into organic chemistry at Oxford University from its foundation in 1916 until its retirement as a laboratory in 2003. He received an honorary DCL from Oxford University.During Perrins's life he amassed one of the most important book collections in the world, particularly strong in medieval illuminated manuscripts and printed ballads. To help finance and re-establish the Royal Worcester factory after World War II, he decided to sell his important collection of early printed books, and they were mostly dispersed in a series of sales at Sotheby's in London in 1946 and 1947. His illuminated manuscripts and other remaining printed books were sold after his death in three major auction sales in 1958 to 1960. A record total for a single collection of £1,100,000 was raised by these sales. Items once owned by C. W. Dyson Perrins now form the basis of many other prominent collections, such as the Lessing J. Rosenwald Collection now in the Library of Congress.Many other items from his collection were given or bequeathed by him to public institutions such as the Victoria and Albert Museum, the National Gallery, the Ashmolean Museum, Winchester Cathedral library, and the British Museum.

He was known for his contributions in the preservation of the arts, specifically in the field of ceramics and paintings. He is best known for his role in saving the Worcestershire-based LeaPerrins sauce company from financial ruin and building it into a global brand. Perrins was born in 1864 in Clapham, London to Charles Hubert Dyson Perrins, a solicitor, and his wife Sophia Elizabeth (née Peckham). He attended Harrow School, and later studied law at Trinity College, Cambridge. However, his interest in art and ceramics led him to leave his legal career behind and instead develop his family's business of creating exquisite ceramics. Perrins was a great patron of the arts, and his donations to museums like the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum were incredibly significant. He was instrumental in acquiring rare and important ceramics for these museums, many of which would have been forgotten without his help. In addition to his contributions to museums, Perrins was also a collector and expert on paintings, and built up an impressive personal collection in his lifetime. Perrins' most significant contribution, however, was to the family business, LeaPerrins, the creator of the world-famous Worcestershire Sauce. The company had been struggling financially when Perrins joined in 1896. However, with his business acumen and determination, Perrins managed to turn the company around, and by the time of his death in 1958, the sauce had become one of the most widely recognized and loved condiments in the world. Perrins' philanthropy extended to the wider community. He was a generous supporter of many charities and organizations, and was particularly committed to supporting education. He helped to establish the University of Birmingham and was a major donor to the Imperial College of Science in London. Charles William Dyson Perrins was a man of many talents; he was a successful businessman, a philanthropist, a collector, and a patron of the arts. He dedicated his life to preserving and promoting the things he loved, and his contributions have had a lasting impact on the world of ceramics and culture in Britain.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2618531}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Frank Staff\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Frank Staff (15 June 1918 – 10 May 1971) was a South African ballet dancer, choreographer, producer, and company director. He was a major figure in the history of European theatrical dance in South Africa.Early life Frank Cedric Staff was born to an Irish mother and an English father in the diamond mining town of Kimberley, in what is now the Northern Cape Province of South Africa. As a teenager, he moved to Cape Town, where he attended Diocesan College and received his early dance training from Helen Webb and Maude Lloyd, who had studied with Marie Rambert in London. After Lloyd returned to England in 1933, she encouraged her young pupil to join her. At age fifteen, Staff moved to London to continue his training at Rambert's school in Bedford Gardens.Career Staff was soon invited to join Rambert's Ballet Club, as her performing group was then called. For the next twelve years, from 1933 to 1945, he worked with the Rambert company as both a dancer and choreographer. Except for two seasons with the Vic-Wells Ballet, 1934/35 and 1938/39, and a brief stint with Walter Gore's London Ballet in 1940, he was a featured performer and choreographer with Ballet Rambert.Dancer Staff inherited many of Hugh Laing's roles in the Rambert repertory, including The Lover in Jardin aux Lilas and Mercury in The Planets, both works by Antony Tudor. He also danced in several ballets by Frederick Ashton, among them Recamier, Façade, and Mephisto Valse. For the Vic-Wells company, he appeared as Horn Blower in The Rake's Progress by Ninette de Valois and created the role of Cupid in Ashton's Cupid and Psyche (1939). For the London Ballet, he created the role of The Boy, Julien, in La Fête Ėtrange (1940), set to music of Gabriel Fauré by Andrée Howard. Other roles in his varied repertory included The Poet in Les Sylphides, the Spectre in Le Spectre de la Rose, and Harlequin in Le Carnaval, all choreographed by Michel Fokine. He also danced such different roles as Bluebird in The Sleeping Beauty, by Petipa; the Faun in Afternoon of a Faun, by Nijinsky; and Death in Death and the Maiden, by Howard.Choreographer Staff's first choreographic work, The Tartans, was a new version of Ashton's ballet of the same name. A pas de trois for himself, his wife Elisabeth Schooling, and Walter Gore, set to music by William Boyce, it was made for Ballet Rambert in 1938. Over the next two years, he contributed three of his best works to the company's repertory: Czernyana (1939), to the piano exercises of Carl Czerny; Enigma Variations (1939), to the score by Edward Elgar; and Peter and the Wolf (1940), to the music and text of Sergei Prokofiev. All these works displayed his facility for witty invention that would characterize many of his later ballets. He also created Czerny 2 (1941), a second version of his popular hit, a series of dances caricaturing different kinds of ballet. Combined with its predecessor under the title Czernyana, it remained in the Rambert repertory for many years. During the war years in England—September 1939 to May 1945—Staff served as a captain in the Argyle and Sutherland Highlanders but was released temporarily to choreograph Peter and the Wolf and Czerny 2.Upon completion of his military service, Staff returned to his homeland in 1946 and joined the South African National Ballet in Cape Town. There he danced in his own ballets and produced works in which he had appeared in England, notably Nijinsky's L'Après-midi d'un Faune and Howard's Death and the Maiden. Returning to Britain in 1947, Staff spent the next few years as an international freelance. He served as resident choreographer of the Metropolitan Ballet (1947–1948), toured Australia with Ballet Rambert (1948), toured the United States and Canada with Sadler's Wells Ballet (1949), and was subsequently appointed ballet master and choreographer at the Empire Theatre (1950) on London's Leicester Square. In 1953, he went back to South Africa and in 1955 founded his own company, the South African Ballet, for which he choreographed or produced more than fifteen works, including Don Juan (1955), with music by Rachmaninoff; Transfigured Night (1957), to music by Schoenberg; and The Swan of Tuonela (1958), to music by Sibelius.In 1963, the South African government established four professional ballet companies, one in each of the four provinces, and Staff would eventually work with them all: the companies of the Cape Performing Arts Board (CAPAB Ballet), the Natal Performing Arts Council (NAPAC Ballet), the Performing Arts Council of the Transvaal (PACT Ballet), and the Performing Arts Council of the Orange Free State (PACOFS Ballet). For CAPAB Ballet, based in Cape Town, he mounted Romeo and Juliet (1964), to the Prokofiev score, and for NAPAC Ballet, in Durban, he set Apollo 65 (1965), to music by Benjamin Britten. Moving on to the Transvaal in 1966, he worked in Johannesburg until 1968 as resident producer and choreographer with PACT Ballet under the direction of Faith de Villiers. These years were especially productive. Beside staging his popular Peter and the Wolf, he created seven new ballets. Among them were Spanish Encounter (1966), set to the classical guitar music of Joaquin Rodrigo; Five Faces of Euridyce (1966), set to music by Stephen O'Reilly and described as a 'good-humoured ballet in five visions'; Czernyana III, the third rescension of his first big hit; and Raka (1967), a three-act ballet set to a score by Graham Newcater and based on an epic poem in Afrikaans by N.P. van Wyk Louw. Raka proved such a success that it was soon made into a film that was distributed worldwide by Twentieth Century Fox.Thereafter, Staff was artistic director of PACOFS Ballet in Bloemfontein from 1969 until his death in 1971. Among the six ballets he created for this company were two notable works made in 1970: Mantis Moon, based on a Bushman legend and set to music by Hans Maske, and Séance, derived from Menotti's opera The Medium but set to music by Britten. Staff's unfinished work, The Rain Queen (1971), set to a commissioned score by Newcater, was planned as the first full-length ballet with an indigenous South African theme. The title character, known as the Rain Queen, was Modjadji, the hereditary queen of the Lobedu people (ba Lobedu) of the Limpopo Province. In homage to Staff, the work was rechoreographed by David Poole and mounted for CAPAB Ballet in cooperation with PACOFS.Personal life Staff married four times. He wed his fellow Ballet Rambert dancer Elisabeth Schooling in 1942, and she danced in many of his early works. He next married English dancer Jaqueline St. Clere, followed by South African musical comedy actress Heather Lloyd-Jones. All three of these marriages ended in divorce. Staff's fourth wife was South African dancer Veronica Paeper, who became a prolific choreographer in her own right as director of CAPAB Ballet, later known as Cape Town City Ballet.

He was known for his paintings, set designs and abstract sculptures. Staff began his formal art education at the Hastings School of Art before being accepted to the prestigious Royal College of Art, London, in 1938, where he studied painting under well-known artists such as Henry Moore and Eric Ravilious. During his time at the RCA, Staff started experimenting with set design and sculpture, gaining a reputation as a versatile and talented artist. After serving in the Royal Navy during World War II, he worked as an art director for various advertising agencies before returning to his painting and sculpture in the early 1950s. Staff's early painting works were heavily influenced by the neo-romantic movement, but he soon shifted towards abstract expressionism, with works featuring bold, gestural brushstrokes and intense colours. His sculptures were similarly abstract and often monumental in scale, featuring curious forms that seemed to defy gravity. Throughout his career, Staff exhibited his works in major galleries and museums throughout the UK and abroad, including the Royal Academy of Arts and the Tate Gallery in London. He also received numerous awards and honours for his contributions to the arts, including being made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in 1975.

The movie’s distinctiveness comes from its role-reversing plot, showing a world where gender roles are reversed, and women occupy positions of privilege and power while men have to navigate social and cultural hierarchies with the limited resources at their disposal. The film follows the story of Damien (Vincent Elbaz), a chauvinistic advertising executive who, after receiving a blow to the head, wakes up in an alternate universe where women are the dominant sex, and men are the ones who are objectified and oppressed. In this world, women take on traditionally male roles, such as the President of France and CEO positions, while men are relegated to lower-paying jobs and objectified in the media. Throughout the movie, Damien struggles to fit into this new world, often experiencing discrimination and being sexually harassed by women in positions of power. At the same time, he finds himself drawn to Alexandra (Marie-Sophie Ferdane), a feminist writer who challenges him to confront his prejudices and rethink his assumptions about gender equality. The movie received positive reviews, with critics praising its thought-provoking premise and the strong performances of its cast. I Am Not an Easy Man has also been lauded for its ability to flip gender norms and provoke discussions about the ways traditional gender roles affect men and women. Overall, I Am Not An Easy Man is a must-watch for anyone looking for a fresh and insightful take on gender issues in society. Its unique blend of comedy, romance, and social commentary is sure to leave a lasting impression on viewers.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 57301074}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Ana Brnabić\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Ana Brnabić (, ; born 28 September 1975) is a Serbian politician serving as the prime minister of Serbia since 2017. She is the first woman and first openly gay person to hold the office.She entered government as the minister of public administration and local self-government from 11 August 2016 until 29 June 2017, under Prime Minister Aleksandar Vučić and Acting Prime Minister Ivica Dačić. In this role, Brnabić initiated reforms of central government services in Serbia.After he was inaugurated as the president of Serbia on 31 May 2017, Vučić proposed Brnabić as his successor in June 2017. Prime Minister Brnabić and her cabinet were voted into office on 29 June 2017 by a majority of 157 out of 250 Members of the National Assembly of Serbia. Elected as a non-partisan politician, she joined the ruling Serbian Progressive Party in 2019, and was subsequently elected as vice president in 2021.In 2019, Brnabić was ranked by Forbes magazine as the 88th most powerful woman in the world and as the 19th most powerful female political and policy leader. Some observers believe that she has no political power in line with the constitutional role of chief of the executive, arguing instead that Vučić wields power in his capacity as the president.Early and personal life Brnabić was born in Belgrade. Her paternal grandfather Anton Brnabić, an ethnic Croat Yugoslav military officer, was born in Stara Baška on the Croatian island of Krk in Croatia. He fought with the Yugoslav Partisans during World War II and was ranked lieutenant colonel after the war. Her paternal grandmother Mica was born in Gorobilje near Požega. Her maternal grandparents are from Babušnica, southeastern Serbia. Her father Zoran was born in Užice in 1950 and finished his studies in Belgrade, where the family lived.Brnabić is a lesbian, the second female LGBT head of government in the world following Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir (Iceland 2009–13), and fifth openly LGBT head of government overall following , Elio Di Rupo (Belgium 2011–14), Xavier Bettel (Luxembourg 2013–present), and Leo Varadkar (Ireland 2017–20).In 2017, she became the first head of government of any Balkan country to attend a gay pride march when she attended one in Belgrade.In 2019, her partner Milica Đurđić gave birth to a boy; Brnabić is the first openly gay prime minister whose partner gave birth while the prime minister was in office.Education and business career Brnabić was raised in Belgrade, Serbia, where she attended the prestigious Belgrade Fifth Gymnasium. In addition to her Serbian education, Brnabić holds a Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) diploma of Northwood University, Michigan, USA, and an MBA of the University of Hull, England, UK, and worked for over a decade with international organizations, foreign investors, local self-government units, and the public sector in Serbia.Prior to Brnabić's appointment to the Government of Serbia, she was director of Continental Wind Serbia, where she worked on the implementation of the investment of €300 million into a windpark in Kovin. She was a member of the managing board of the non-profit foundation Peksim.She has been engaged in different US consulting companies that implemented USAID-financed projects in Serbia. She was deputy manager of the Serbia Competitiveness Project, the expert on the Local Self-government Reform Program in Serbia and the senior coordinator of the Program of Economic Development of Municipalities. She was active in the foundation of the National Alliance for Local Economic Development (NALED) in 2006. During that engagement, she participated in the introduction of the concept of local economic development in Serbia and building of potentials of municipalities to improve the business environment at the local level with active promotion of investments. She became a member, and thereafter the president, of the managing board of NALED.PoliticsIn August 2016, she was appointed as the Minister of Public Administration and Local Self-Government. In addition, she is the president of the Council for Innovative Entrepreneurship and Information Technologies of the Government of Serbia, as well as of the Republic Council for National Minorities and the vice president of the Republic Council for Public Administration Reform.Brnabić described herself as a pro-European and technocratic prime minister. She explained that the priorities for her government are modernization, education reform and digitization. On the other hand, she has been criticised because she is the head of a conservative and nationalist government which also includes openly anti-Western and pro-Russian ministers.In May 2018, Brnabić took over the Ministry of Finance until the new Minister was appointed, following the resignation of Dušan Vujović. On 29 May 2018, she appointed Siniša Mali as Vujović's successor on that position. On 26 July 2018, Brnabić hosted a ceremony at the United States Congress in Washington, which was held to mark the 100th anniversary of raising the Serbian flag in front of the White House.In October 2019, the Prime Minister confirmed she had joined the ruling Serbian Progressive Party. On 25 October 2019, Brnabić signed a Free Trade Agreement between Serbia and the member states of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), extending the list of Serbian products that can be exported to the EAEU territory.After the COVID-19 pandemic spread to Serbia in March 2020, Brnabić was appointed for the head of the Health Crisis Committee. After president Vučić declared a state of emergency on 15 March, the government issued regulations on measures during a state of emergency with the aim of suppressing the consequences of the outbreak. A curfew was introduced for the first time in Serbia since World War II. Brnabić was elected as vice president of SNS in November 2021.Debate on constitutional roles Political scientists Krzysztof Zuba listed Brnabić as an example of the head of government with extensive political dependence on a leader of the governing party. He defined a situation in which the Prime Minister does not have their own political position as the chief of the executive as a “surrogate government”, explaining that a distribution of power that is contrary to constitutional determinants is a characteristic of non-democratic systems.In February 2019, Freedom House reported that Serbia's status declined from Free to Partly Free due to deterioration in the conduct of elections, continued attempts by the government and allied media outlets to undermine independent journalists through legal harassment and smear campaigns, and Vučić's accumulation of executive powers that conflict with his constitutional role. Opposition leaders and some observers describe her as a mere puppet of Vučić, whose presidency, according to the Constitution, is largely ceremonial with no significant executive power. Brnabić never denied this, and even said that Vučić should act as a 'mentor' of the prime minister.KosovoIn December 2018, commenting on the announced transformation of the Kosovo Security Force into the Kosovo Armed Forces, Brnabić said: 'I hope we won’t have to use our military, but at the moment, that’s one of the options on the table because one cannot witness a new ethnic cleansing of the Serbs and new Storms — although Edi Rama is calling for them. When someone knows you have a strong army, then they have to sit down and talk to you.'In addition, in May 2019, Foreign Minister of Kosovo Behgjet Pacolli said that he would not allow Brnabić to enter Kosovo because of what he said is her racist ideology. Brnabić, during the handover of a European Commission 2019 progress report, said: 'Haradinaj, Thaçi and Veseli are competing to see who the biggest nationalist and chauvinist is. What scares me most is that we are dealing with irrational people, the worst kind of populist, people who literally walked out of the woods.' This was met with strong criticism, particularly by Twitter users, who campaigned with the hashtag #literallyjustemergedfromthewoods in order to mock the Prime Minister.On 20 January 2020, the governments of Serbia and Kosovo agreed to restore flights between their capitals for the first time in more than two decades. The deal came after months of diplomatic talks by Richard Grenell, the United States ambassador to Germany, who was named special envoy for Serbian-Kosovar relations by President Donald Trump the year before.Srebrenica genocide remarks In an interview on 14 November 2018 with the German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle, Brnabić denied that the July 1995 massacres of Bosniaks by Bosnian Serb forces in Srebrenica had been an act of genocide. Two weeks later, the European Parliament adopted a resolution saying that the parliament regretted the continuing denial of the Srebrenica genocide by parts of the Serbian authorities and recalled that full cooperation with the ICTY and its successor mechanism included accepting its judgements. The Hague Court criticised Brnabić for denial of the Srebenica genocide.LGBT rightsAfter she was appointed prime minister, Brnabić said that she did not want to be branded Serbia's gay prime minister and that she did not plan 'to push LGBT legal reforms at this stage' because she wanted to prioritise other policy reforms. In September 2017, Brnabić took part in the pride parade in Belgrade and became the first Serbian prime minister to attend a pride parade. At the event, Brnabić said:Brnabić says that she advocates inheritance rights of same-sex couples. In February 2019, Milica Đurđić, Brnabić's partner, gave birth to a son named Igor, but same-sex marriage is constitutionally banned and LGBT parenting is not regulated in Serbia. According to Agence France-Presse, 'Ana Brnabić is one of the first prime ministers whose partner has given birth while in office... and the first in the world in a same-sex couple'. Some journalists and LGBT activists have concluded that Brnabić has failed to advocate for LGBT equality in Serbia.Awards She has been awarded a number of plaudits for the development projects on which she worked, for the promotion of socially accountable business operation and tolerance. She has been awarded the Order of the Republika Srpska.See alsoPrime Minister of SerbiaCabinet of Ana BrnabićSecond cabinet of Aleksandar VučićList of elected and appointed female heads of state and governmentList of the first LGBT holders of political officesList of openly LGBT heads of governmentReferencesExternal linksPrime Minister of Serbia|-|-1975 births Living people 21st-century Serbian women politicians Alumni of the University of Hull Female heads of government Lesbian politicians LGBT heads of government LGBT people from Serbia Northwood University alumni Politicians from Belgrade Prime Ministers of Serbia Serbian people of Croatian descent Women government ministers of Serbia Women prime ministers 21st-century LGBT people", "machine_text": "Ana Brnabić is a prominent Serbian politician who currently serves as the Prime Minister of Serbia, making her the first openly gay head of government in a conservative country.

The Ural Republic has been supported by a minority of Ural residents who feel that the region's economy, culture, and politics differ from those of western Russia, and would benefit from greater autonomy. Historically, the Ural Mountains have been a crossroad for different empires, tribes, and cultures. It was the home for various tribes, including Bashkirs, Tatars, Udmurts, and Russians, who have established their own states and cultural heritage. The idea of the Ural Republic has gained traction after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the Ural region's economic decline. The supporters of the Ural Republic argue that the region's abundant natural resources, such as oil, gas, and minerals, would be better managed if controlled by local authorities, rather than being exploited by the Russian government. However, the movement for the Ural Republic has faced opposition from the Russian government, which sees the region as an integral part of the federation. The Russian government has also accused the Ural Republic supporters of being separatists and financed by foreign powers. Political tensions have risen in recent years, with the Ural Republic supporters staging protests and demanding greater autonomy. However, the Russian government has responded with arrests, repression, and censorship. As of yet, the Ural Republic remains a hypothetical state, without clear pathways towards independence.

Born into a wealthy family in Devon, Rolle was educated at Oxford University before studying law in London. He was called to the bar in 1627 and quickly established himself as a respected jurist. However, it was his political acumen that earned him the most acclaim, and he was elected to Parliament in 1640 as part of the Long Parliament. During his time in the House of Commons, Rolle was a vocal opponent of King Charles I and his policies. He was a strong supporter of the Puritan cause and argued vehemently for religious and political reform. Rolle was also one of the leading figures in the Parliamentary Army, helping to organize troops and equipment during the early stages of the Civil War. Despite his contributions to the Parliamentary cause, Rolle was expelled from Parliament in 1653 following the rise of Oliver Cromwell's Protectorate. He retired from politics soon thereafter and spent the remainder of his life in relative obscurity.

Heller in Salzburg. His musique concréte work Requiem was premiered in 1975 at the Austrian Broadcasting (ORF).He earned his master's (M.A.) and doctoral (Ph.D.) degrees with distinction at the Benjamin T. Rome School of Music of The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., where he was a graduate student of Conrad Bernier and Helmut Braunlich (composition), Donald Thulean (conducting), Cyrilla Barr, Ruth Steiner, and Robert M. Stevenson (musicology).Recent works His original compositions have been performed in Europe and the Americas. His Misa de San Isidro (2001) for a cappella chorus was premiered in Tenerife, the Canary Islands, Spain, in 2002, and has been performed by different professional choirs at festivals in Medellín, Tokyo, and New York City. His Piano Concerto No. 1 (2005), dedicated to the Russian pianist and teacher, Alexandr Sklioutovski, was premiered in June, 2006 at the National Theatre in Guatemala City by José Pablo Quesada as soloist and the Millennium Orchestra, the composer conducting. In 2007, it was performed to critical acclaim and great enthusiasm at the National Theatre in San José, Costa Rica, again with pianist Quesada and the composer conducting the National University Symphony Orchestra. Quesada also performed it at the 15th Latin American Music Festival in Caracas, Venezuela in May, 2008, with the National Philharmonic Orchestra of Venezuela. Lehnhoff's Piano Concerto No. 2 (2007) was very successfully premiered in August, 2008 in Guatemala City by concert pianist Sergio Sandí, with the combined Millennium Orchestra and Bachensemble Leipzig, the composer conducting. The concertos are written in a personal, highly original post-modern style in which contemporary art-music idioms and techniques, but also blues, tango, and jazz influences can be traced. His aphoristical twelve-tone Hai-kai for piano have attracted the attention of scholars such as the distinguished musicologist Dr. Tamara Sklioutovskaia, and have been performed by international pianists. His piano and chamber music has been performed at numerous festivals in Europe, North- and South America. His diptych Escenas primigenias was published on CD and served as a model for cinematic development. His stage work in progress Satuyé, on an own multilingual libretto, is about the Afro-Caribbean Garinagu (or Garifuna) people and their arrival at Central American shores.Revival of historical music His research of the Music of Guatemala has revealed a previously unknown musical wealth, including the Maya, Renaissance, baroque, classical, romantic, 20th century, and current trends. From the early 1980s on, Dieter Lehnhoff had become interested in searching for music composed in Central America and specifically Guatemala during the Spanish rule (1524–1821). His research initiatives brought to light a number of compositions by Renaissance masters Hernando Franco, Pedro Bermúdez, and Gaspar Fernández, as well as Guatemalan baroque composers Manuel José de Quirós, Rafael Antonio Castellanos, Pedro Antonio Rojas, and José Eulalio Samayoa. A first anthology was published in Antigua Guatemala in 1984. The music was revived in a number of concerts conducted by Lehnhoff, thus surprising the musical world with a new repertoire of high quality. The first series of digital recordings (1992–99), which spanned from the late Maya times to the end of the 20th century, was released as part of the monumental Historia General de Guatemala, an encyclopedic publication in six volumes written by over 150 specialists in every historical area. The series of seven CDs included premiere recordings of music from every historical period. The revival of the historic Music of Guatemala through Lehnhoff's concerts, writings, and recordings had a significant effect on the strengthening of the cultural identity of Guatemalans in times of civil confrontation and turmoil. The dissemination of his musical and historical findings at more than 40 international festivals, concerts, congresses, and meetings also helped to restore the cultural image and prestige of the country.As a conductor, he has founded and directed various instrumental groups, orchestras, and choral groups. He has been invited to perform as a conductor, composer, lecturer, or leader of his Millennium Ensemble at over forty international festivals and concerts in Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, El Salvador, Germany, Guatemala, Japan, Mexico, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Spain, the United States, and Venezuela. He has produced a series of compact discs with premiere recordings of works by Guatemalan composers of all times.Academic programmes In the academic field he also pioneered by establishing and directing several institutions and programmes devoted to the strengthening of musical culture in Guatemala. Thus, he proposed and carried out the design and establishment of the Music Department at the Universidad del Valle de Guatemala, which offered, for the first time in the country, a Bachelor's degree and a teaching license in Music. He also established the Institute of Musicology at the Universidad Rafael Landívar , which is under his direction, and which is primarily devoted to musicological research. He has taught numerous courses in musicology, music theory, applied music, and composition. He has also been an invited professor at the doctoral programme of the National University of Costa Rica. For his extensive writings he was made a corresponding member of the Royal Spanish Academy, being also invited to join the Academies of History of Argentina, Guatemala, Puerto Rico, Spain, Uruguay, and Venezuela.He is founder and president of the Guatemalan Music Council, affiliated to the International Music Council.Selected compositionsOrchestral:Symphony No. 1 (1975) Symphony No. 2 (1990) Concerto for Piano and Orchestra No. 1 (2005)Concerto for Piano and Orchestra No. 2 (2007) Tardes de feria (2008) Caribe Suite No. 1 (2009)Stage:Streichquartett, music theatre (1974) Milarepa Superstar, musical (1977, score lost) Caribe, opera (2007–11)Vocal-choral:Cinco canciones criollas, own lyrics (1976) Cantos latinos de natividad, Latin texts (1988) Misa de San Isidro, Latin text of the Mass ordinary (2001) Chaaj: el juego de pelota Maya, own poem (2003) Salve, cara Parens, mezzo-soprano or baritone, strings, and piano, Latin poem by Rafael Landívar (2011)Chamber:Canto IV, clarinet quartet (1985) In memoriam, violin, clarinet, and cello (1989) Santelmo, solo violin (1990) Cantares del Llano, string or wind quintet (1994) Incidente en Izabal, clarinet and marimba (1997) Kyrieleis, string quartet (2002) Llegó Pacheco, wind quintet (2004) Tardes de feria, wind quintet (2005) Sonata urbana, clarinet and piano, also a version for cello and piano (2010) Música lúdica, flute, clarinet, and piano (2012) Sonata porteña, flute and piano (2013) Caribe Suite No. 2, clarinet and string quartet (2013)Piano:Album para la juventud (1988) Hai-kai (2001) Doppler (2012)Electro-acoustic:Requiem (1975)Memorias de un día remoto (1999) Rituales nocturnos (1999)BooksCreación musical en Guatemala.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Social order\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The term social order can be used in two senses: In the first sense, it refers to a particular system of social structures and institutions. Examples are the ancient, the feudal, and the capitalist social order. In the second sense, social order is contrasted to social chaos or disorder and refers to a stable state of society in which the existing social structure is accepted and maintained by its members. The problem of order or Hobbesian problem, which is central to much of sociology, political science and political philosophy, is the question of how and why it is that social orders exist at all.Sociology Thomas Hobbes is recognized as the first to clearly formulate the problem, to answer which he conceived the notion of a social contract. Social theorists (such as Karl Marx, Émile Durkheim, Talcott Parsons, and Jürgen Habermas) have proposed different explanations for what a social order consists of, and what its real basis is. For Marx, it is the relations of production or economic structure which is the basis of social order. For Durkheim, it is a set of shared social norms. For Parsons, it is a set of social institutions regulating the pattern of action-orientation, which again are based on a frame of cultural values. For Habermas, it is all of these, as well as communicative action.Principle of extensiveness Another key factor concerning social order is the principle of extensiveness. This states the more norms and the more important the norms are to a society, the better these norms tie and hold together the group as a whole.A good example of this is smaller religions based in the U.S., such as the Amish. Many Amish live together in communities and because they share the same religion and values, it is easier for them to succeed in upholding their religion and views because their way of life is the norm for their community.Groups and networks In every society, people belong to groups, such as businesses, families, churches, athletic groups, or neighborhoods. The structure inside of these groups mirrors that of the whole society. There are networks and ties between groups, as well as inside of each of the groups, which create social order.Some people belong to more than one group, and this can sometimes cause conflict. The individual may encounter a situation in which he or she has to choose one group over another. Many who have studied these groups believe that it is necessary to have ties between groups to strengthen the society as a whole, and to promote pride within each group. Others believe that it is best to have stronger ties to a group, enabling social norms and values to be reinforced.Status groups 'Status groups' can be based on a person's characteristics such as race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, caste, region, occupation, physical attractiveness, gender, education, age, etc. They are defined as 'a subculture having a rather specific rank (or status) within the stratification system. That is, societies tend to include a hierarchy of status groups, some enjoying high ranking and some low.' One example of this hierarchy is the prestige of a school teacher compared to that of a garbage man.A certain lifestyle usually distinguishes the members of different status groups. For example, around the holidays a Jewish family may celebrate Hanukkah while a Christian family may celebrate Christmas. Other cultural differences such as language and cultural rituals identify members of different status groups.Smaller groups exist inside of one status group. For instance, one can belong to a status group based on one's race and a social class based on financial ranking. This may cause strife for the individual in this situation when he or she feels they must choose to side with either their status group or their social class. For example, a wealthy African American man who feels he has to take a side on an issue on which the opinions of poor African Americans and wealthy white Americans are divided and finds his class and status group opposed.Values and norms Values can be defined as 'internal criteria for evaluation'. Values are also split into two categories, there are individual values, which pertains to something that we think has worth and then there are social values. Social values are our desires modified according to ethical principles or according to the group, we associate with: friends, family, or co-workers. Norms tell us what people ought to do in a given situation. Unlike values, norms are enforced externally – or outside of oneself. A society as a whole determines norms, and they can be passed down from generation to generation.Power and authority An exception to the idea of values and norms as social order-keepers is deviant behavior. Not everyone in a society abides by a set of personal values or the group's norms all the time. For this reason, it is generally deemed necessary for a society to have authority. The adverse opinion holds that the need for authority stems from social inequality.In a class society, those who hold positions of power and authority are among the upper class. Norms differ for each class because the members of each class were raised differently and hold different sets of values. Tension can form, therefore, between the upper class and lower class when laws and rules are put in place that do not conform to the values of both classes.Spontaneous order The order does not necessarily need to be controlled by the government.Individuals pursuing self-interest can make predictable systems.These systems, being planned by more than one person, may actually be preferable to those planned by a single person.This means that predictability may be possible to achieve without a central government's control.These stable expectations do not necessarily lead to individuals behaving in ways that are considered beneficial to group welfare.Considering this, Thomas Schelling studied neighborhood racial segregation. His findings suggest that interaction can produce predictability, but it does not always increase social order.In his researching, he found that 'when all individuals pursue their own preferences, the outcome is segregation rather than integration,' as stated in 'Theories of Social Order', edited by Michael Hechter and Christine Horne.Social honor Social honor can also be referred to as social status. It is considered the distribution of prestige or 'the approval, respect, admiration, or deference a person or group is able to command by virtue of his or its imputed qualities or performances'. The case most often is that people associate social honor with the place a person occupies with material systems of wealth and power. Since most of the society finds wealth and power desirable, they respect or envy people that have more than they do. When social honor is referred to as social status, it deals with the rank of a person within the stratification system. Status can be achieved, which is when a person position is gained on the basis of merit or in other words by achievement and hard work or it can be ascribed, which is when a person position is assigned to individuals or groups without regard for merit but because of certain traits beyond their control, such as race, sex, or parental social standing. An example of ascribed status is Kate Middleton who married a prince. An example of achieved status is Oprah Winfrey, an African American woman from poverty who worked her way to being a billionaire.Attainment Two different theories exist that explain and attempt to account for social order. The first theory is 'order results from a large number of independent decisions to transfer individual rights and liberties to a coercive state in return for its guarantee of security for persons and their property, as well as its establishment of mechanisms to resolve disputes,' as stated in Theories of Social Order by Hechter and Horne. The next theory is that 'the ultimate source of social order as residing not in external controls but in a concordance of specific values and norms that individuals somehow have managed to internalize.' also stated in Theories of Social Order by Hechter and Horne. Both arguments for how social order is attained are very different. One argues that it is achieved through outside influence and control, and the other argues that it can only be attained when the individual willingly follows norms and values that they have grown accustomed to and internalized. Weber's insistence on the importance of domination and symbolic systems in social life was retained by Pierre Bourdieu, who developed the idea of social orders, ultimately transforming it into a theory of fields.See alsoAnti-social behaviourAntinomianismConformityMarx's theory of historyNorm (sociology)Social hierarchyReferencesFurther readingHobbes, T.Leviathan or The Matter, Forme and Power of a Common Wealth Ecclesiasticall and Civil.Sociological terminology Structural functionalism", "machine_text": "Social order refers to the set of norms, values, and expectations that govern the behavior of individuals within a society. It is a complex phenomenon that arises from the interaction of multiple factors such as culture, history, geography, and politics. Social order dictates what is considered acceptable or unacceptable behavior within a given society, providing a framework for individual action that allows people to predict how others will behave. The concept of social order has been the focus of much academic debate over the years. Some scholars have argued that social order is inherently oppressive, designed to maintain the power and privilege of dominant groups at the expense of others. Others have suggested that social order is a necessary condition for the functioning of society and that without it, chaos and anarchy would ensue. Regardless of one's perspective, the fact remains that social order is an essential feature of human society. It provides a sense of stability and predictability, allowing people to interact with one another in a relatively smooth and efficient manner. Without social order, societies would be unable to function, and individuals would be left to fend for themselves in a world characterized by constant conflict and uncertainty. There are many different types of social order, each with its own set of norms, values, and expectations. Some societies maintain social order through the use of formal institutions such as churches, governments, and legal systems. Others rely on informal mechanisms such as customs, traditions, and social norms. Still, others use a mixture of both formal and informal methods to maintain social order. Ultimately, the nature of social order varies from society to society and depends on a host of factors. Whether one sees it as a force for good or a source of oppression, social order remains one of the defining features of human society and a crucial factor in our ability to live together in peace and harmony.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 396418}

Boeing\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "William Edward Boeing (; October 1, 1881 – September 28, 1956) was an American aviation pioneer who founded the Pacific Airplane Company in 1916, which a year later was renamed to The Boeing Company, now the largest exporter in the United States by dollar value and among the largest aerospace manufacturers in the world. William Boeing's first design was the Boeing Model 1 (or BW Seaplane), which first flew in June 1916, a month before the company was founded. He also helped create the United Aircraft and Transport Corporation (known as 'United Airlines' today) in 1929 and served as its chairman. He received the Daniel Guggenheim Medal in 1934 and was posthumously inducted in to the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1966, ten years after his death.Early lifeWilliam Boeing was born in Detroit, Michigan, to Marie M. Ortmann, from Vienna, Austria, and Wilhelm Böing (1846–1890) from Hohenlimburg, Germany. Wilhelm Böing emigrated to the United States in 1868 and initially worked as a laborer. His move to America was disliked by his father and he received no financial support. He later made a fortune from North Woods timber lands and iron ore mineral rights on the Mesabi Range of Minnesota, north of Lake Superior.In 1890, when William was eight, his father died of influenza and his mother soon remarried. He attended school in Vevey, Switzerland, and returned to the US for a year of prep school in Boston. He enrolled at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, dropping out in 1903 to go into the lumber business.CareerHe was successful in the venture, in part by shipping lumber to the East Coast via the then-new Panama Canal, generating funds that he would later apply to a very different business.While president of Greenwood Timber Company, Boeing, who had experimented with boat design, traveled to Seattle. During the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition in 1909, he saw a manned flying machine for the first time and became fascinated with aircraft. In 1910, at the Dominguez Flying Meet, Boeing asked every pilot foreign and domestic if he could go for an airplane ride and was repeatedly denied except for French aviator Louis Paulhan. Boeing waited and Paulhan finished the meet and left never giving Boeing his ride. Boeing took flying lessons at Glenn L. Martin Flying School in Los Angeles and purchased one of Martin's planes. Martin pilot James Floyd Smith traveled to Seattle to assemble Boeing's new Martin TA hydroaeroplane and continue to teach its owner to fly. Huge crates arrived by train and Smith assembled the plane in a tent hangar erected on the shore of Lake Union. Boeing's test pilot, Herb Munter, soon damaged the plane. When he was told by Martin that replacement parts would not be available for months, Boeing told his friend, Commander George Conrad Westervelt of the US Navy, 'We could build a better plane ourselves and build it faster.' Westervelt agreed. They soon built and flew the BW Seaplane, an amphibian biplane that had outstanding performance. Boeing decided to go into the aircraft business, using an old boat works on the Duwamish River near Seattle for his factory.Founding of Boeing Aircraft In 1916, Boeing went into business with George Conrad Westervelt as 'BW' and founded Pacific Aero Products Co. The company's first plane was the Boeing Model 1 (BW Seaplane). When America entered the First World War on April 8, 1917, Boeing changed the name to Boeing Airplane Company and obtained orders from the US Navy for 50 planes. At the end of the war, Boeing concentrated on commercial aircraft to service airmail contracts.International airmail attempt On March 3, 1919, Willam Boeing partnered with Eddie Hubbard made the first delivery of international airmail to the United States. They flew a Boeing C-700 seaplane for the demonstration trip from Vancouver, British Columbia, to Seattle's Lake Union, carrying a bag of 60 letters from the Canadian post office for delivery in the U.S.Boeing family In 1921, Boeing married Bertha Marie Potter Paschall (1891-1977). She had previously been married to Nathaniel Paschall, a real estate broker with whom she had two sons, Nathaniel 'Nat' Paschall Jr. and Cranston Paschall. The couple had a son of their own, William E. Boeing Jr. (1922–2015). The stepsons went into aviation manufacturing as a career. Nat Paschall was a sales manager for competitor Douglas Aircraft, which later became McDonnell Douglas. Bill Jr. became a private pilot and industrial real estate developer.Bertha Boeing was the daughter of Howard Cranston Potter and Alice Kershaw Potter. Through her father, she was a descendant of the founders of Alex. BrownSons merchant bankers Alexander Brown, James Brown, and Brown's son-in-law and partner Howard Potter; and through her mother, the granddaughter of Charles James Kershaw and Mary Leavenworth Kershaw (a descendant of Henry Leavenworth).The name Boeing is anglicized from the German name Böing, and had Welsh origins as a patronymic from Owen. The prefix and suffix were added later.Breakup of Boeing GroupIn 1929, Boeing joined with Frederick Rentschler of PrattWhitney to form United Aircraft and Transport Corporation. The new grouping was a vertically integrated company with interests in all aspects of aviation, intending to serve all aviation markets. In a short time, it bought a host of small airlines, merging them with Boeing's pioneering airline under a holding company, United Air Lines.In 1934, the United States government accused William Boeing of monopolistic practices. The same year, the Air Mail Act forced airplane companies to separate flight operations from development and manufacturing. William Boeing divested himself of ownership as his holding company, United Aircraft and Transport Corporation, broke into three separate entities:United Aircraft Corporation, holding the former eastern US manufacturing (later United Technologies Corporation)Boeing Airplane Company, with western US manufacturing, which later became The Boeing CompanyUnited Air Lines for flight operationsHe began investing most of his time in his horses in 1937. Boeing Airplane Company, though a major manufacturer in a fragmented industry, did not become successful until the beginning of World War II.Later lifeBetween 1935 and 1944, William Boeing and his wife Bertha set aside a large tract of land north of the Seattle city limits for subdivision, including the future communities of Richmond Beach, Richmond Heights, Innis Arden, Blue Ridge, and Shoreview. The Boeings placed racially restrictive covenants on their land to enforce segregation, forbidding properties from being 'sold, conveyed, rented, or leased in whole or in part to any person not of the White or Caucasian race.' Non-whites could only occupy a property on the land if they were employed as a domestic servant 'by a person of the White or Caucasian race.'He spent the remainder of his life in property development and thoroughbred horse breeding. Concerned about the possibility of World War II battles in the Pacific Northwest, he purchased afarm in the countryside east of Seattle, which he dubbed 'Aldarra.' The estate remained in the family until most of the land was developed into a golf course residential community in 2001. Several acres, however, remained in the family, including the Boeing's own and two smaller houses. His primary residence for most of his life, however, was a mansion in The Highlands community close to Seattle; the William E. Boeing House was later listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Boeing Creek running near this property bears his name.On May 14, 1954, William Boeing and his wife Bertha went back to the Boeing Airplane Company to participate in the rollout ceremony for the Boeing 367-80 prototype.William Boeing died on September 28, 1956, at the age of 74, three days before his 75th birthday. He was pronounced dead on arrival at the Seattle Yacht Club, having had a heart attack aboard his yacht, Taconite, in Puget Sound, Washington. His ashes were scattered off the coast of British Columbia, where he spent much of his time sailing.He was posthumously inducted into the Aviation Hall of Fame in Dayton, Ohio, in 1966.In 1984, Boeing was inducted into the International AirSpace Hall of Fame at the San Diego AirSpace Museum.

This festival is mainly celebrated by the Vaishnavas of the Vaishnavism tradition in Hinduism.SignificanceKalki is said to be born in the village of Shambala, to a Brahmin family, whose parents are Vishnuyasha (father) and Sumati (mother). This event commences at the end of Kali Yuga, which is described that when Kalki grows up and becomes a warrior, he rides a Divine white horse named Devadatta with a blazing sword, accompanied by a talking parrot, Shuka, who knows everything; the past, present and future. He then goes around the world to fight evil kingdoms and especially Kali, who is a demon that has the powers of a yogi to control beings and makes them commit Adharma. He then restores Dharma and returns to his homeland, heaven or Vaikuntha.CelebrationDuring the festival, the devotees wake up early in the morning, take a bath before sunrise, fast and recite the Vishnu Stotram, either in the temple or at home. At home, they recite the Narayana Mantra and other mantras 108 times. The performance of the pooja (worship) starts with the Beej mantra, where then an offering of a seat to the Lord (asana) takes place, whereby in the further process, the idol is washed spiritually with water and panchamrita, with the offering of flowers, diya and incense.

Trails from the valley floor and down from other park areas outside the valley lead to both the top and base of Upper Yosemite Fall.The upper fall is formed by the swift waters of Yosemite Creek, which, after meandering through Eagle Creek Meadow, drop over the edge of a hanging valley in a spectacular and deafening show of force.Middle Cascades: Between the two obvious main plunges there are a series of four smaller plunges collectively referred to as the Middle Cascades. Taken together these account for a total drop of , more than twice the height of the Lower Fall. Because of the narrow, constricted shape of the gorge in which these drops occur and the lack of public access, they are rarely noted. Most viewpoints in the valley miss them entirely. Several vantage points for the cascades are found along the Yosemite Falls trail. Several hikers climbing down from the trail towards the cascades have required an expensive helicopter rescue due to steep and slippery terrain and features.Lower Yosemite Fall: The finaldrop adjacent to an accessible viewing area, provides the most-used viewing point for the waterfalls. Yosemite Creek emerges from the base of the Lower Fall and flows into the Merced River nearby. Like many areas of Yosemite the plunge pool at the base of the Lower Fall is surrounded by dangerous jumbles of talus made even more treacherous by the high humidity and resulting slippery surfaces.In all but the wettest years, the falls cease flowing altogether in late summer or fall.A very small number of rock climbers have taken the opportunity to climb the normally inaccessible rock face beneath the falls, although this is an extraordinarily dangerous undertaking; a single afternoon thunderstorm could restart the falls, sweeping the climbers off the face.Lower Yosemite Fall is easily accessible near the Yosemite Lodge in Yosemite Valley. The top of Upper Yosemite Fall may be reached via a steep, strenuous, and usually crowdedhike beginning near Camp 4 in Yosemite valley. Upper Yosemite Fall may also be reached via the Yosemite Creek Trail from the Tioga Road to the north.The Ahwahneechee Legend The main village of the native people of Yosemite Valley, the Ahwahneechee, was located at the base of the falls.The Ahwahneechee people called the waterfall 'Cholock' ('the fall') and believed that the plunge pool at its base was inhabited by the spirits of several witches, called the Poloti. An Ahwaneechee folktale describes a woman going to fetch a pail of water from the pool, and drawing it out full of snakes.

Upper Yosemite Falls is the largest of the three sections and is the main attraction for visitors to the park. It is a strenuous hike to reach the top, but the views and experience are well worth it. The hike to the top of the falls is around 3.5 miles and takes around 6-8 hours round trip. The trail is steep and rugged, with switchbacks and rocky terrain. The Middle Cascades and Lower Yosemite Falls are visible from the valley floor and can be accessed via a shorter hike of around 1 mile. The Lower Falls also has a wheelchair-accessible trail and is a popular spot for families and visitors with limited mobility. Yosemite Falls is fed by snowmelt and can vary in flow throughout the year. The peak flow is typically in late spring or early summer, and the falls can sometimes dry up entirely in late summer or fall. Yosemite Falls and the surrounding area are an essential part of the history and culture of Yosemite National Park. The waterfall has been an inspiration for artists, photographers, and writers, and is a symbol of the beauty and majesty of the wilderness. Visitors to the park are encouraged to follow Leave No Trace principles and respect the natural environment and wildlife. Yosemite Falls is a fragile ecosystem that requires protection and preservation for generations to come.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 154298}

It was built in the late 19th century in order to transport lumber and slate from the small town of Mount Gretna to the surrounding areas. The railway was constantly used until the 1930s, when it was abandoned and its tracks were removed. The railway was constructed in 1878 and was initially used to transport lumber and other materials to the towns surrounding Mount Gretna. It was a 2-foot gauge railway, which means that the distance between the rails was only 2 feet. The locomotives used on the railway were small and nimble, and were able to navigate the steep grades and narrow curves of the railway. In the early 20th century, the railway began to transport slate from local quarries as well. The slate was used for roofing and other construction purposes. The railway became an important part of the local economy, and provided jobs for many people in the area. However, with the advent of automobiles and trucks, the railway became less important. By the 1930s, the railway was no longer profitable, and it was abandoned. The tracks were removed and the locomotives were sold or scrapped. In the 1970s, a group of local enthusiasts began to restore the railway. They rebuilt the tracks, and acquired several small locomotives and cars. Today, the Mount Gretna Narrow Gauge Railway operates as a tourist attraction, giving visitors a glimpse into the past and allowing them to experience the joys of a ride on a historic narrow gauge railway. The railway is open to the public from May through October, and offers rides on weekends and holidays. The rides cover a distance of approximately 1.5 miles, and provide visitors with beautiful views of the surrounding mountains and forests. The railway is staffed by volunteers, who are passionate about preserving the history of the railway and sharing it with others.

It is difficult to accomplish in part because of the extremely careful regulation of temperature required to fuse the enamel without damaging the glass in which it is embedded. The edges of the foil form a frame for the enamel, giving the appearance, as artist William Claude Harper described it, of 'the most delicate cloisonné that you can imagine'.1950s rediscovery In 1953, metalsmith Margret Craver saw a pin decorated using the technique.Craver began studying the technique, researching and testing it over the course of about thirteen years to reproduce it.Because the technique was not being practiced, and there were no instructional texts in existence, the work was slow, and Craver had to design her own tools.On the technique, Craver said 'it took forever, because this was such an ancient technique and no one knew a darn thing about it.I just had to start out and do it myself.'See alsoCreativity techniquesList of art techniquesReferencesArtistic techniques Jewellery making Vitreous enamel", "machine_text": "En résille is a French term that refers to a type of fabric that features an open, net-like pattern.

This type of eruption is named after the Roman writer and naturalist Pliny the Younger, who witnessed the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD. During a Plinian eruption, a column of volcanic gas and ash can reach heights of tens of kilometers, with ashfall and pyroclastic flows being the major hazards from such eruptions. The plume can be sustained for several hours or days, and the eruption can cause widespread devastation to the surrounding landscape. The Plinian Core eruption type is considered to be the most violent type of volcanic eruption, and is caused by highly viscous magma that is unable to easily escape through volcanic vents. Instead, pressure builds up within the magma chamber, leading to an explosive eruption. The eruption may be triggered by a number of factors, including earthquakes, rising magma, and gas pressure within the magma chamber. The Plinian Core eruption type has been observed in many volcanoes around the world, including Mount St. Helens in the United States, Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, and Mount Tambora in Indonesia. The eruption of Mount Tambora in 1815 was one of the most powerful Plinian eruptions in recorded history, and led to global cooling and crop failures for several years afterward. Despite the destructive nature of Plinian Core eruptions, they also play an important role in shaping the Earth's surface and providing fertile soil for agriculture. The ash and other volcanic materials deposited during eruptions can enrich the soil and promote plant growth, leading to the development of new ecosystems over time.

South Africa had declared war on Germany, one of the Axis powers, on September 6, 1939. South African troops were sent to North Africa, where they fought in the desert campaign against the Axis powers. The country also played an important role in the Battle of Madagascar, which took place in May 1942. South African forces, with the support of the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force, captured the strategic island from the Vichy French. The war had a significant impact on South African society. Thousands of South Africans joined the military and were sent to fight in different parts of the world. The government also introduced measures to control the economy and resources, including rationing of food, goods, and services. The Union Defence Force was also expanded to cope with the increased demand for soldiers. The army was divided into two divisions, the 1st and 2nd South African Infantry Divisions, and the South African Air Force was formed in 1940. The Navy was also expanded, with the creation of the South African Naval Forces in August 1940. The war had a profound effect on race relations in the country. Although the government initially refused to allow black and coloured soldiers to fight in the war, many still volunteered and formed their own segregated units. The Labour Party, which represented mainly coloured and Indian interests, also gained strength during this time and demanded greater political representation for non-whites. In conclusion, 1940 was a significant year in South African history. The country was deeply involved in the Second World War and played an important role in various campaigns. The war had a significant impact on society, and it also helped to reshape the political landscape of the country.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 3604754}

From an early age he was attracted to painting.His uncle, the sculptor Jules Printemps, a student of François Jouffroy at the École nationale des Beaux-Arts, supported his vocation and prepared him for the entrance examination to this school. He was admitted in 1892, joined the workshop of Gustave Moreau and regularly visited it until Moreau’s death in 1898. He also associated with such artists asRouault, Matisse, Evenepoel, Albert Marquet, Edgar Maxence and Charles Milcendeau.Around this period his work was largely part of the Symbolist movement and he experimented with a poetic or mythological vision and with the sensuality of the female nude.WorkPortrait painterHe soon established his reputation as a portrait artist receiving commissions from such eminent personalities as Sully Prudhomme, the first recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature, the Prince and Princess of Waldeck, Mr and Mrs Commettant, and Prince Yusupov, the assassin of Rasputin.Léon Printemps married in 1903 and frequently painted his family in an intimate tone, particularly his daughter Lucile whose death at the age of 6 touched him profoundly, as well as his son René.Landscape painterLéon Printemps was a landscape painter his entire life. His desire to meet Flemish masters prompted him to travel to Belgium and the Netherlands at the end of the nineteenth century, returning home with various studies.Later in life his attraction to the beaches of Normandy, which were quite fashionable at the time, became more marked. After the First World War he started painting landscapes in Brittany and particularly the islands of the Vendée coast, the island of Noirmoutier, the island of Yeu, where he painted seascapes and portraits of fishermen and old farmers’ wives.Flemish and Dutch influenceThe appeal of the work of Flemish and Dutch masters during Printemps’ visits to the Louvre Museum inspired him to travel to Belgium and the Netherlands on several occasions with a desire to better understand the art of these great Flemish and Dutch masters. Several paintings, which were the outcome of his first visits to Belgium, were presented at the Salon des artistes français (1898 and 1905), the Salon artistique des PTT (1905) and in regional exhibitions, in Lille (1898) and in Nantes (1906).In 1894 Printemps travelled to Belgium for the first time, presumably in the company of other students of Gustave Moreau, visiting Bruges, Ghent, Mechelen and Antwerp. Two years later he travelled to the Meuse Valley where he painted the Bayard Rock, a remarkable sight in Dinant. In 1897, he spent some time in the Netherlands visiting the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. In 1898, he returned to Bruges and Mechelen. In 1929 and 1933 he also took his son René, who was also studying to become a painter at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, on a trip to explore these two cities.Léon Printemps died on 9 July 1945, in his studio at 6 rue Furstenberg, where the Musée National Eugène Delacroix is currently located.GalleryParticipation in Exhibitions – Awards and MeritsSalon des artistes français, between 1893 and 1939.

Born in Paris in 1848, he was a lawyer by profession and became involved in politics during the Third Republic. Printemps was first elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1898 as a member of the Radical Party. He quickly established himself as a vocal advocate for social justice and reform, particularly in the areas of education, labor rights, and public health. Printemps was one of the leading voices pushing for the creation of a national healthcare system in France, which eventually became a reality in the form of the National Health Insurance scheme in 1945. During World War I, Printemps was a member of the French parliament’s Commission for Foreign Affairs and was responsible for negotiating with the United States government. He played a key role in convincing U.S. President Woodrow Wilson to enter the war on the side of the Allies. After the war, Printemps continued to be an influential figure in French politics, using his platform to fight for the rights of workers and the poor. He was a passionate believer in the power of the state to effect positive change in society, and his policies helped lay the groundwork for France’s post-war social welfare system. Printemps passed away in 1935 at the age of 87. He remains a revered figure in French political history, remembered as a tireless advocate for social justice and reform. His legacy endures in the form of his contributions to the development of France’s modern welfare state.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 34871387}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Nagelfluhkette\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Nagelfluhkette is a mountain range located in Bavaria, Germany and Vorarlberg, Austria, bordering on the northern edge of the Allgäu Alps. It has a maximum altitude of 1,834 m above sea level. Its name derives from the rock type Nagelfluh. In older and geological literature, as well as in the local vernacular language, one also finds the term Hochgratkette.The geotope Nagelfluhkette is the most extensive object of the Nagelfluhkette Nature Park, which was established on 1 January 2008.LocationThe Nagelfluhkette extends throughout the western part of the Allgäu Alps west of the Illertal, in which the Bavarian cities Sonthofen and Immenstadt lie. Between these cities is Blaichach, from where the mountain range stretches for about 20 km in west-southwest direction to the Vorarlberg community of Hittisau. The German-Austrian border runs along the saddle of the mountain ridge between Hohenfluhalpkopf and Hochhäderich (Hoher Häderich).The Nagelfluhkette is one of the last higher elevations of the Alps before further north the Alpine foothills of the Allgäu begin. In the north lies the valley of the west-flowing Weißach; in the southeast the Hörnergruppe rises beyond the valley of the northeast-flowing Aubach.Nagelfluhkette Nature ParkThe Nagelfluhkette Nature Park is the first cross-border nature park to be created between Germany and Austria, thus representing an international natural protection pilot project. It also constitutes the first natural park in the Bavarian Alps.Priority objectives are the protection, care and development of nature and the diverse landscapes. Nature parks are relatively weak protection instruments, which primarily serve to harmonize the interests of nature conservation and local tourism. This part is located primarily in parts of the Bavarian Forest which are still in use, and not in the well-developed alpine area. In Vorarlberg – unlike in the other federal states of Austria – a nature park is not a legally protected area. The Nagefluhkette Nature Park is a voluntary commitment of the nature park communities themselves. Therefore, the park is (as of 5/2011) not a member of the Association of Nature Parks of Austria (VNÖ).Size and participating communitiesThe Nagelfluhkette Nature Park covers 24,700 hectares in the district of Oberallgäu and 16,300 hectares in the adjacent Bregenzerwald, making a total of about 410 square kilometers. Six Oberallgäu communities and eight Vorarlberg communities joined forces for this project:Germany: Balderschwang, Blaichach, Bolsterlang, Fischen, Immenstadt, Oberstaufen, ObermaiselsteinAustria: Doren, Hittisau, Krumbach, Langenegg, Lingenau, Riefensberg, Sibratsgfäll, SulzbergAdministrationThe nature park administration ('Naturpark Nagelfluhkette e.V.') is based in Bühl am Alpsee, a district of Immenstadt. On the Austrian side, the park is looked after in the community offices.TourismThe Nagelfluhkette is flanked by lower mountain ridges to the north and south and thus offers excellent views in almost all directions. Mountain railways are operated all year round in Mittagberg (Mittagbahn) and Hochgrat (Hochgratbahn).HikingHikes on the Kammweg chain are of the most popular in the district of Oberallgäu, thanks to the glorious views. Since all mountains are individually accessible, there is a great variety of secure walks, with only a minimum ofclimbing obstacles. Some places, especially between Steineberg and Stuiben, and between Falken and Hochhädrich, are difficult and exposed, requiring a high degree of sure-footedness and a head for heights.Shorter routes lead, for example, from the mountain station of the Mittagbahn over the Steineberg and Stuiben through the Steigbachtal back to Immenstadt. Another trail is the Maximiliansweg, which leads over the mountains Hochgrat, Rindalphorn, and Buralpkopf.Well-secured and -signposted medium-length tours include the crossing of the entire eastern chain from Hochgrat to the Mittag (Nagelfluh-Gratwanderung), which follows the European long-distance hiking trails E4 and E5 at this stage, and the crossing of the western chain between Hochgrat and Falken (Luftiger Grat).The Königstour, an entire crossing of the Nagelfluh from Mittagberg to Hochhädrich, is doable on a single day, provided the hiker is sportive and fit (length of the tour: about 8.5 hours, including breaks). In any case, the Staufner Haus of the German Alpine Club is available as an accommodation hut.Winter sportsIn addition to the mountain railways, there are ski lifts to the Einguntkopf (from Falkenhütte) and Hochhädrich, each on the snow-sure north side.Slopes for skiers are located at Mittagberg, Hochgrat, Einguntkopf and Hochhädrich in Austria. Large parts of the Nagelfluh crossing are accessible as winter hikes with snowshoes or touring skis.MountainsThe highest mountain of the Nagelfluhkette is the Hochgrat with a height of 1,834 m.External linksWebsite of the Nature Park NagelfluhketteReferencesMountain ranges of Vorarlberg Mountain ranges of Bavaria", "machine_text": "Nagelfluhkette is a mountain range in the Allgäu Alps located in southern Germany. The range is located in the state of Bavaria and stretches for approximately 35 kilometres. Nagelfluhkette is also the name given to a geologic formation found in the Allgäu Alps. The geologic formation that makes up Nagelfluhkette is distinctive due to its composition of sedimentary rock called Nagelfluh, which is made up of small pebbles and sand. This type of rock formation is also found in other parts of the Alps and is known for its resistance to erosion. Nagelfluhkette includes several prominent peaks, including Hochgrat, which stands at 1,834 metres and is the highest peak in the range. Other notable peaks in the range include Rindalphorn, Mittagberg, and Stuiben. The region surrounding Nagelfluhkette is popular with hikers and skiers, due to the area’s stunning natural landscapes and numerous trails. During the summer months, the range is a popular location for hiking, biking, and mountain climbing. In the winter, the mountains are popular with skiers and snowboarders. Nagelfluhkette is also an important location for biodiversity, as the range is home to a wide variety of flora and fauna, including alpine marmots, chamois, ibex, and golden eagles. In addition to its natural beauty and recreational opportunities, Nagelfluhkette also has cultural significance. The range has served as a location for Alpine farming and has been inhabited by humans for thousands of years. Today, visitors can explore local traditions and cultural heritage in the range’s numerous villages and towns. Overall, Nagelfluhkette is a stunning and unique natural wonder, offering visitors the opportunity to experience breathtaking landscapes, recreational activities, and cultural history.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 58240447}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Nomos Glashütte\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "NOMOS Glashütte is a German watchmaking company based in Glashütte, Saxony, which specializes in artisan manual-winding and automatic mechanical watches. It was founded in January 1990, two months after the fall of the Berlin Wall, by Roland Schwertner. The designs for the first collection were drawn up by Susanne Günther, drawing influence from the Bauhaus purist style. NOMOS designs are known for their clean and modernist aesthetic. NOMOS Glashütte is a member of the Deutscher Werkbund, a predecessor of the Bauhaus movement and a group that represents the interests of companies that combine handcraft with industrial production, and design with functionality. The management team is made up of CEO Uwe Ahrendt, a graduate engineer and responsible for production; Judith Borowski, heading up communications and design in Berlin; and Roland Schwertner, who continues to be in charge of sales.HistoryIn 1990, Roland Schwertner, an IT expert and photographer from Düsseldorf, registered the trademark NOMOS Glashütte/SA. The first collection of NOMOS watches came out in 1992. NOMOS Glashütte now has three sites in Glashütte, a place renowned for its tradition of watchmaking: The administration department can be found in the former Glashütte station building, while most of the watchmakers are located on Am Erbenhang street. Since 2017, a further manufacturing facility can be found in the Schlottwitz district. Annual production is approximately 20,000 pieces. In its early years, the company focused on manufacturing mechanical watches with hand-wound movements. The basis for these movements was, until 2005, the Swiss-made ETA SA / Peseux 7001. Since April 2005, NOMOS Glashütte has only used in-house movements. Beginning with α (Alpha), a manual winding caliber, the range has since been expanded to include a range of other manual winding movements with additional functions. The first automatic NOMOS watch, the Tangomat, was first introduced in the summer of 2005.In 2014, the company unveiled its own in-house escapement, known as the NOMOS swing system, which made it no longer reliant on Swiss manufacturers. This new component was gradually introduced into NOMOS’ caliber range. Since 2016, the company has concentrated on upgrading its caliber range with the NOMOS swing system; once upgraded, the calibers receive a name beginning with 'DUW'. This acronym stands for 'Deutsche Uhrenwerke' and is intended to highlight the company's in-house caliber production.The calibers in the company's neomatik (“new automatic”) series are very thin: NOMOS Glashütte introduced DUW 3001, its tenth in-house caliber, in 2015. At only 3.2 mm in height, this caliber is exclusive to the neomatik series, launched at BaselWorld 2016. The latest movement, DUW 6101, or “neomatik date,” was introduced in 2018. In this year the company also introduced the models Autobahn and Tangente Update, which debuted the neomatik date caliber. At BaselWorld 2019, the company introduced three new collections: the duo series, three new sport watches (two versions of Tangente Sport and one of Club Sport), and three automatic Club Campus models.ModelsThe brand started production in 1992 with four basic models (Tangente, Orion, Ludwig, and Tetra). NOMOS Glashütte has since gradually expanded its range of watches to include new models and sizes, such as Club and Metro. In 2013 the company introduced two gold models to its collection, Lambda and Lux. There are currently thirteen NOMOS watch models, which come in a number of variations. These are:Tangente (1992): originally hand-wound with optional date function, power reserve indicator, white or champagne-colored dial, in 33, 35,38, 39, and 41 mm diameter; also available as a limited edition for Doctors Without Borders in the UK, USA, and Germany Tetra (1992): hand-wound with optional automatic winding, power reserve indicator, various dial colors, in 27, 29.5, and 33 mm diameter; also available as a special edition for Doctors Without Borders in Germany Orion (1992): hand-wound with optional automatic winding, date function, various dial colors, in 33, 35, 38, 39, and 41 mm diameter Ludwig (1992): hand-wound with optional automatic winding, date function, white or champagner dial, in 33, 35, 38, and 41 mm diameter Tangomat (2005): automatic in 38 mm diameter with optional date function, white or dark-colored dial, and world time function Club (2007): hand-wound with optional automatic winding, date function, white or dark-colored dial, in 36, 38, and 40 mm diameter Zurich (2009): automatic in 40 mm diameter with optional date function, various dial colors, and world time function Ahoi (2013): automatic, 36 or 40 mm in diameter with water-resistance to 20 atm, optional date function, and various dial color options Lux (2013): hand-wound shape watch in 18 kt white or rose gold, various dial colors, in two sizes: 40.5 × 36 mm and 38.5 × 34 mm Lambda (2013): hand-wound watch in 18 kt white or rose gold; black, deep blue or off-white dial, in two sizes: 39 and 42 mm diameter Metro (2014): hand-wound in 35, 37, 38, or 39 mm diameter with date, power reserve indicator, and various dial color options Minimatik (2015): automatic in 35.5 mm diameter, available in white, champagne, or midnight blue Autobahn (2018): automatic in 41 mm diameter with date function, superluminova on dial, and three dial color optionsCalibersNOMOS Glashütte owns multiple patents for their calibers, such as for the in-house date mechanism, power reserve display and for the proprietary escapement, the NOMOS swing system.

It was written in 1979 but was not published until 1990, after the Berlin Wall fell.SummaryIt is the story of a day in the life of a nameless East German woman whose apartment and occupational activity are openly watched by the Stasi.The story raises the subject of surveillance, particularly the feeling of paranoia, self-doubt, and the disturbances it causes in everyday life; symptoms of fear and nervousness, such as unrest, sleeplessness, weight-loss, and hair-loss. Her daily routine is shaped around this surveillance. She trusts no one and suspects everyone.No conversation can be held within her apartment without the telephone jack being pulled to prevent calls from having unwanted listeners. Telephone calls are a façade, where only code words and petty banter take place. She becomes obsessed with her observers. Who are they? Who sent them? Do they have normal lives? Are they normal people outside their jobs?As a first-person narrative, the reader is transported into the author's inner monologue and introspection. By the end of the story she is very much influenced by the guests at her manuscript reading, young adults by whom the establishment feels threatened and remove by force. The main character realizes that the youth are watching and writing everything down. There is hope and one day she will be able to speak of this time and her experiences freely. And she realizes that perhaps 'they' are right in distrusting her.1990 German novels Novels set during the Cold War East German novels Novels by Christa Wolf Works about the Stasi", "machine_text": "What Remains is a novella by the American author Christa Wolf, first published in 1990. The novella is set in East Germany during the final days of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) and explores the ways in which people deal with loss and change. The story is narrated by an unnamed woman who is reflecting on her life in East Germany before the fall of the Berlin Wall. She is haunted by memories of her former lover who died in a car accident before they could reunite. As she grapples with her grief, the unnamed woman also tries to come to terms with the collapse of the GDR and the uncertain future that lies ahead. One of the novella's key themes is the idea of nostalgia. Wolf explores the ways in which people are drawn to the past, even when it may not have been a particularly happy time. The unnamed woman is torn between her memories of her former lover and her desire to move on and embrace the changes that are happening in her country. What Remains is also a meditation on the nature of history and memory. The unnamed woman reflects on her own experiences and how they have been shaped by the political and social climate of the GDR. She also grapples with the legacy of her country's past and what it means for her future. Overall, What Remains is a powerful and poignant exploration of loss, change, and the enduring human capacity for hope. Wolf's writing is introspective and lyrical, and she captures the complex emotions and conflicting thoughts of her protagonist with sensitivity and nuance. The novella has been widely praised for its deep insights into the human condition and its vivid evocation of a pivotal moment in German history.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 34541087}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"ITF World Champions\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The International Tennis Federation (ITF) designates a World Champion each year based on performances throughout the year, emphasising the Grand Slam tournaments, and also considering team events such as the Davis Cup and Fed Cup. Men's and women's singles champions were first named in 1978; the title is now also awarded for doubles, wheelchair, and junior players. It is sometimes named the 'ITF Player of the Year' award, alluding to similar other year-end awards in tennis.Rules and procedures The ITF's constitution states that no tennis tournament can be designated the 'World Championships' without unanimous consent of the ITF Council. There is currently no such tournament. The constitution also states: The ITF may award the title of World Champion to players who, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, are the most outstanding players in any one-year. The names of players who have been awarded this title shall be listed in the Roll of Honour. It also states: Official Tennis Championships [i.e. the Grand Slam events] shall be the decisive factor in the determination of the ITF World Champions for each year.For singles, ITF appoints a panel of former top players at the start of the season, which votes on the champion at the end of the season.The boys' and girls' singles and doubles titles prior to 2003 were awarded based on world ranking. Since then singles and doubles rankings have been combined in a single award each for boys and for girls.The world champion accolade has been extended by the ITF to wheelchair tennis players of the Men's and Women's division since 1991. In November 2017, the ITF announced that the quad wheelchair tennis division is to be recognised in its annual list of ITF World Champions.In 1996, the Philippe Chatrier Award was introduced, honouring individuals or organisations who have made outstanding contributions to tennis globally, both on and off the court. The award is considered to be the ITF's highest accolade and is named after the former French tennis player Philippe Chatrier, who was President of the governing body between 1977 and 1991.The ITF World Champions' Dinner takes place in Paris during the French Open, to honour the previous year's champions, who are presented with a trophy, but not any monetary prize.For 2020 there were no ITF World Champion awards given due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The tennis season was suspended for about 5 months for both the female and the male tennis players.Men's singles The first men's panel in 1978 had three members, Don Budge, Fred Perry, and Lew Hoad, who attended the season's Grand Slam events at ITF expense to inform their choice. The 1983 panel split two to one between John McEnroe (votes of Budge and Perry) and Mats Wilander (vote of Hoad). The 1984 panel had five members, while the 1985 panel had four: Budge, Perry, Hoad, and Tony Trabert. When Ivan Lendl was chosen as champion for 1985, the panel's announcement was accompanied with a rebuke for Lendl's criticism of some tournaments and his refusal to play in the Davis Cup. Perry and Trabert were on the 1986 panel, with performances outside the Grand Slams taken into consideration.The 1990 designation of Lendl as champion was a surprise.That year, the Association of Tennis Professionals named Stefan Edberg its 'Player of The Year', in accordance with the ATP Rankings, while Tennis Magazine (France) ranked Edberg first, Andre Agassi second, and Lendl third. Tennis also suggested the ITF was punishing Edberg for denigrating the Grand Slam Cup tournament it had introduced. The ITF panel, of Perry, Trabert, and Frank Sedgman, called it 'the toughest decision any of us can remember having to make', and stated it was Lendl's better average performance in the Grand Slams that made the difference.The choice to award Djokovic the ITF World Champion of 2013 over Nadal was unexpected. Nadal finished the year ranked #1 and with more slams (2 to 1), more Masters titles (5 to 3), and more tournament titles (10 to 7).Similar to the situation with Edberg in 1990, the ITF cited Nadal's failure to win a match at 2 of the 4 slams (DNP the Australian Open, 1st round loss at Wimbledon) to justify their decision and Djokovic's consistent results across all four Slams (1 title, 2 runner-ups, 1 SF), Davis Cup (led Serbia to final, won 7/7 singles rubbers) and the ATP World Tour Finals (won title).Other instances when the ITF choices differed from the ATP rankings are 1978 (Jimmy Connors), 1982 (McEnroe), 1989 (Lendl).None of these, however, were controversial and were generally agreed upon, with the 1978 and 1982 choices being particularly clear cut in favor of Borg (1978) and Connors (1982).Women's singles The women's panel initially featured three former women's champions, Margaret Court, Margaret duPont and Ann Jones. Althea Gibson was a member through the early 1980s.ITF world champions for women differed from the WTA year-end rankings the following years: 1978 (Martina Navratilova), 1994 (Steffi Graf), 2001 (Lindsay Davenport), 2004 (Lindsay Davenport), 2005 (Lindsay Davenport), 2011 (Caroline Wozniacki), 2012 (Victoria Azarenka), 2017 (Simona Halep).DoublesBoysGirlsSingles (1978–2003)Doubles (1978–2003)WheelchairQuad's wheelchairSee also World number 1 ranked male tennis players World number 1 ranked female tennis players International Tennis Federation Philippe Chatrier Award ATP Awards WTA Awards Tennis statisticsReferences ITF ConstitutionFootnotesExternal linksHistory of tennis Tennis awards Lists of tennis players Tennis records and statistics International Tennis Federation ITF", "machine_text": "ITF World Champions refer to individuals who have won the International Tennis Federation's (ITF) annual senior world championships. The ITF has hosted annual world championships tournaments since 1913 and currently recognizes champions in four categories – men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, and women's doubles. The ITF World Champions are determined based on a points system, with players earning points according to their performance in ITF-sanctioned tournaments throughout the year. The players with the highest accumulation of points in each category are declared the ITF World Champions. Some of the most notable and successful ITF World Champions include Rod Laver, Margaret Court, John McEnroe, Steffi Graf, and Serena Williams. Laver holds the record for most ITF World Champion titles, having won the men's singles title seven times. The ITF World Champions are widely recognized as some of the most accomplished and skilled players in the history of tennis. Their skill, dedication, and success have inspired generations of tennis players and fans around the world. In addition to recognizing individual champions, the ITF also honors National Teams as World Champions in men's and women's categories. The Davis Cup, established in 1900, is the premier team competition event of men's tennis. The Fed Cup, founded in 1963, is the premier team competition event in women's tennis.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Cruising (driving)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Cruising is a social activity that primarily consists of driving a car. Cruising can be an expression of the freedom of possessing a driver's license. Cruising is distinguished from regular driving by the social and recreational nature of the activity, which is characterized by an impulsively random, often aimless course. A popular route (or 'strip') is often the focus of cruising. 'Cruise nights' are evenings during which cars drive slowly. A cruise can be a meeting of car enthusiasts at a predetermined location, organised predominantly through the internet (in recent times) but also largely through mobile phone, word of mouth or simply by a cruise being established enough that it becomes a regular event.Some ethnic groups identify with lifestyles related to cruising, such as the Hispanos of New Mexico, Chicanos, and Mexican-Americans of the Southwestern United States along U.S. Route 66. Meets, like those at lowrider and auto shows, are popular across the United States and worldwide in large part due to these ethnic communities.United StatesHistory There is no clear-cut date when casual driving turned into cruising along a specific route, although it generally began in the years after World War II with youths of Mexican heritage driving lowriders in Southern California towns, and it rapidly became a popular teenage activity.Cruising culture was an evolution of old traditions of strolling down Main Street or around the town square. Although cruising was predominantly boys showing off their cars (ostensibly to meet girls), groups of girls joined in cruising as well. One appeal of cruising was that youths could evade the supervision of parents and family.Driving slowly down long, straight streets, preferably with many traffic lights to increase opportunities to talk to other cruisers or pedestrians, was only one part of cruising. Cruisers would also gather in parking lots, particularly those of drive-ins. As a Tucson journalist noted, 'Cruisers, like moths and June bugs, eventually congregate around brightly lighted areas.' Cruisers were also apt to arrange impromptu races with other cruisers.As early as the 1960s, some towns established ordinances to prohibit driving through parking lots without stopping and the police issued tickets for loitering and curfew violations. Increasingly, cruisers would travel from wider areas to gather on popular strips, with police viewing these visitors as troublemakers. Reports of clashes between groups of cruisers began to appear in local newspapers.However, cruising continued to remain popular, with wildly painted vans and pickup trucks joining hot rods and muscle cars in the 1970s. In many locales, there was a generally positive relationship with law enforcement. Racing in populated areas was discouraged by police surveillance and traffic, but cruisers engaged in other games such as mooning onlookers, laying rubber when a signal turned green, and 'chinese fire drills' in which all occupants of a car stopped at a light would get out, run around the car, and jump back in.There was some decline in cruising in the 1970s, possibly connected to the rise of gas prices but also due to a growing change in community attitudes toward cruising. The San Francisco Bay Area had a 'cruising summit' in 1977 for area police to discuss 'our mutual problems with cruising'. The gathering numbers of vehicles and increases in tensions and violence led many communities to begin looking for ways to discourage cruising, despite many adults retaining a permissive acceptance of cruising with nostalgia for their own cruising days. Although business merchants and shoppers had been inconvenienced for years by cruisers, tolerance had dissipated and law enforcement was encouraged to step in.During the summer of 1974, Los Angeles police began cracking down on cruising, first by banning parking along Van Nuys Boulevard and then in August making it a one-way street. The following summer, as many as 15,000 youths from as far away as San Diego converged on Van Nuys, encouraged by local disc jockeys. A similar crackdown on Whittier Boulevard led to the formation of a cruiser's rights group. Police barricaded portions of Whittier in an attempt to disrupt cruising, but even local adults objected to this practice. Other measures were tried, such as shutting portions of Whittier down completely at night. Cruisers moved to Highland Avenue, resulting in the arrest of 170 during the second weekend of September 1979. The following summer, a section of Van Nuys was closed after 9 p.m. The rationale for the blockade was that it only required fifteen police to close the road, but they would need at least 150 officers to police the 15,000 cruisers who had gathered there.As quickly as one strip became unusable, cruisers would find new sites. It became a persistent battle between authorities and cruisers. In 1982, the California state legislature passed a law that gave cities express sanction to shut down streets being used for cruising, when driving 'for purposes of socializing and assembling interferes with the conduct of businesses, wastes precious energy resources, impedes the progress of general traffic and emergency vehicles, and promotes the generation of local concentrations of air pollution and undesirable noise levels'.Efforts to stop cruising continued, with increasing blockades and mass arrests. In 1985, random checkpoints began to appear, with police stopping cars passing the spot more than once in a given timeframe. Computers were added in 1988 to help track the cars. New curfews for minors were established. Cruising in southern California was generally suppressed by 1990. Other regions used tactics similar to southern California's, with similar mixed results. Police in Galveston, Texas began arresting cruisers, but had to back down in the face of parental complaints. Joplin, Missouri attempted a ban on cruising, but had to repeal it. Merchants in Portland, Oregon complained that they were losing business because of the crackdowns. Multiple towns across the U.S. adopted the checkpoint system.Other towns tried creative alternatives, such as Laurel, Mississippi and Princeton, West Virginia, which both channeled cruisers onto routes that would not interfere with local businesses. Setting aside parking lots specifically for cruisers was tried in Cedar Rapids, Iowa and Columbus, Indiana. The town of Big Stone Gap, Virginia chose to embrace cruising, awarding prizes for the best customized vehicles.Cities continue to struggle with the problems of cruising into the 2000s. In 2006, Milwaukee, Wisconsin even explored letting police confiscate cruisers' cars.While communities try to prevent impromptu cruising, multiple towns have embraced organized cruising revivals. The Woodward Dream Cruise occurs on the third Saturday in August along the original cruising strip in Detroit's northern suburbs. The event is a tribute to the classic Woodward cruisers and attracts approximately 1 million people and 40,000 muscle cars, street rods, and custom, collector, and special interest vehicles. Waukegan, Illinois, has an annual summer cruising festival called 'Scoopin' Genesee'. and Modesto, California celebrates 'Graffiti Summer' with an annual cruise parade. Renton, Washington hosts 'Cruz the Loop' each summer, and in 2020 erected a sculpture to honor cruising the loop.Well-known strips One of the oldest cruising strips in East Los Angeles is located on Whittier Boulevard. Cruising on this strip became a popular pastime among lowriders during the 1940s before spreading to surrounding neighborhoods in the 1950s.Van Nuys Boulevard in the central San Fernando Valley has been a popular cruising strip since the 1950s; the 1979 film Van Nuys Blvd. depicted the cruising culture on the strip. In the late 1970s, the Wednesday night cruise on Van Nuys attracted up to 40,000 cars. Sunset Boulevard was another popular cruise strip.Perhaps the most famous cruising strip (or main drag), however, is McHenry Avenue in Modesto, California.The cruising culture of the late 1950s and early 1960s was depicted in the film American Graffiti. The film was set (but not actually filmed) in director George Lucas's home town of Modesto, which also hosts an annual 'Graffiti Summer' celebration in the film's honor.Cruising in Detroit was popular from the 1950s to the 1970s in the city's northern suburbs along M-1 (Woodward Avenue), from Ferndale north to Pontiac. Cruising along Woodward reached its peak in the mid-1960s, with muscle car competitions that were covered by journalists from Car and Driver, Motor Trend, and CBS World News Roundup. Other popular cruising strips in the Detroit area include US 24 (Telegraph Road) from 12 Mile Road in Southfield to Michigan Avenue in Dearborn, and M-3 (Gratiot Avenue) on the East Side.United KingdomDescription There are two main types of cruise: regular cruises, also known as meets, and one-off cruises.The events that take place are similar; cars meet in car parks, park up or cruise (drive slowly) around the car park while people socialise – often meeting people from cruise websites, show off their cars and admire others' cars. If there is enough space there are often drag races, burnouts, and doughnuts.Meets A meet is a regular gathering, usually weekly or monthly, where the time and place is freely publicised and well known. It is becoming more common these days for these events to be referred to incorrectly as cruises.One-off cruises A one-off cruise is an event organised by a particular group of people or club which would usually be advertised through cruise websites.The final destination of the cruise is often kept secret; it is known only to the convoy leaders in an attempt to keep the cruise unknown to the police until there are a large enough numbers of people at the cruise to make it difficult to disperse.One-off cruises tend to be larger than meets, but larger meets may have magazine attendance.This type of cruise is increasing in recent times due to increased police interest in regular, established cruises.Some large cruises operate a 'convoy-only' policy.Locations Cruises are generally held in retail parks due to the large open car parks needed to accommodate high attendance numbers (sometimes more than 500 cars). Naturally, with many cruises situated in retail parks, most cruise locations are also in close proximity to fast food restaurants such as McDonald's or Burger King.Cruising and the lawAlthough cruising is often not a crime in itself, there are many illegal activities associated with it, and as such cruises are often monitored by the police or even closed. The most commonly cited reasons for breaking up cruises are breach of the peace, caused by loud exhausts and sound systems disturbing local residents, and dangerous driving (such as street racing, burnouts and doughnuts). Police also claim that cruises are used as cover for drug dealing and are attended by stolen or otherwise illegal cars. More recently, police have been using ASBO laws which enable them to seize and impound cars if anti-social behaviour is taking place or if a group refuses to disperse from an area.As a result of increased police powers, legal cruises have been established such as Weston Wheels, although these tend to resemble car shows with camping, music stages and trade stalls.This passive, organised nature often does not satisfy the desires of cruisers, so illegal cruising continues.Many city councils have successfully placed court injunctions to prevent boy racers parking cars in areas that have been popular with them.MagazinesCruising and modifying have long been represented in the commercial magazines Max Power, Fast Car and Redline.In mid-2006, Max Power, the magazine that brought cruises to the forefront, abandoned the scene – preferring to concentrate on 'dream' cars such as Nissan Skylines. Long-time rival Fast Car assumed Max Power's position and now covers multiple cruises across the UK in each edition.See alsoCar customizingHot rodCal-Style VWImport sceneStreet racingBack to the BricksSwedenRaggareUK and Republic of IrelandBoy racerChavSupercar SeasonScangerReferencesFurther readingAutomotive events Driving Kustom Kulture Transport culture", "machine_text": "Cruising is a term commonly used in the United States to refer to the act of driving around in a car for leisure, pleasure or to show off. This activity has its roots in the 1950s when teenage culture started gaining popularity in the country. Since then, cruising has become a widespread phenomenon in many parts of America, particularly in suburban areas. The activity of cruising typically involves driving slowly around a predetermined circular route, or a cruising loop, usually in a downtown or suburban area. The loop may be chosen depending on the availability of facilities such as parking lots, restaurants, shopping centers and other points of interest. Cruisers usually drive around in their personal cars or motorcycles, stop, chat and display their cars to onlookers. Cruising has been associated with the development of a car culture since the 1950s, particularly among young people. It is a form of socializing and a way to connect with others with whom one shares common interests, in this case, cars. In addition to socializing, cruising has also been viewed as a way of self-expression, particularly among young people in search of identity. In some cases, cruising has become a cause of concern for local authorities due to traffic congestion and noise pollution. Consequently, some cities have enforced regulations to control or prohibit the activity, or created designated areas for cruising. Nevertheless, many still participate in the activity, and it remains a popular pastime in the United States. In conclusion, cruising is an American multidimensional activity that has influenced popular culture, music, fashion, and advertising. It is an activity that continues to be celebrated in various communities across the United States, although it has also been the subject of scrutiny. Cruising remains a significant part of popular culture and will continue to evolve and influence the younger generation of drivers in the country.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2473207}

The drillship was designed by Global Marine Inc. (now Transocean Inc.) specifically for a long term contract with the American National Science Foundation and University of California Scripps Institution of Oceanography and built by Levingston Shipbuilding Company in Orange, Texas. Launched on March 23, 1968, the vessel was owned and operated by the Global Marine Inc. corporation. Glomar Challenger was given its name as a tribute to the accomplishments of the oceanographic survey vessel . Glomar is a truncation of Global Marine.AccomplishmentsStarting from August 1968, the ship was embarked on a 15-year-long scientific expedition, the Deep Sea Drilling Program, criss-crossing the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between South America and Africa and drilling core samples at specific locations. When the age of the samples was determined by paleontologic and isotopic dating studies, this provided conclusive evidence for the seafloor spreading hypothesis, and, consequently, for plate tectonics.During 1970, when doing research in the Mediterranean Sea while supervised by Kenneth Hsu, geologists aboard the vessel brought up drill cores containing gypsum, anhydrite, rock salt, and various other evaporite minerals that often form from drying of brine or seawater. These were the first solid evidence for the ancient desiccation of the Mediterranean Sea, the Messinian salinity crisis.ScrappingAfter being operated for fifteen years, Glomar Challenger”'s active duty was ended during November 1983 and she was later scrapped. Her successor, JOIDES Resolution, was launched during 1985.

It was designed and built specifically for deep-sea drilling expeditions and was used extensively in oceanographic research throughout its operational history. The Glomar Challenger was the first vessel of its kind to feature Dynamic Positioning (DP) technology, which allowed the vessel to remain in a fixed position despite external forces such as wind or current. This technology made it possible to drill for oil and gas in deep-sea locations previously thought to be inaccessible. The vessel was equipped with advanced drilling equipment, including a drilling rig capable of penetrating over 4,000 meters of ocean floor. It also had laboratories on board where scientists could analyze samples collected from the sea floor. Over the course of its operational lifetime, the Glomar Challenger conducted over 600 scientific research projects in various parts of the world. One of the most noteworthy expeditions of the Glomar Challenger was the Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP), which was jointly organized by the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Federal Republic of Germany. Over the course of nine years, the Glomar Challenger travelled to various locations in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, drilling over 600 boreholes and collecting samples of sediment and rock from the sea floor. The data collected by the DSDP provided significant insights into the Earth's geology, climate, and evolution. In 1983, the Glomar Challenger was retired from service and was replaced by a newer vessel, the JOIDES Resolution. However, its contributions to oceanographic research and deep-sea drilling technology remain significant. The vessel was subsequently sold to Searex, a Nigerian-based oil exploration company, where it was renamed the Explorer and was used for oil exploration in the African region. However, in 1984, it was converted into an oil production platform named Papahānaumokuākea for tests off the coast of California and Hawaii. In conclusion, the Glomar Challenger was a crucial contributor to oceanographic research and deep-sea drilling technology. Its innovative design and advanced technology allowed scientists to explore previously unreachable depths of the ocean, leading to significant advancements in geological research. Its work on the Deep Sea Drilling Project remains one of the most significant oceanographic research efforts in history.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2014645}

She was found dead at her house on 28 April 8.30 pm by her mother Rajeswari. Jisha was a Hindu woman belonging to the scheduled caste. She was living with her mother, who works as a casual labourer. Her father, Pappu, who had separated from the family, lived alone and was found dead on 9 November 2017 due to natural causes. Police were puzzled in the initial stages of the investigation, due to the mother's paranoia and the family's lack of relationships with neighbors or relatives. This affected the case's progress initially, among other factors.Murder The police found the body mutilated and disturbingly sliced. Forensics concluded the body injuries showed violence, possible torture and presence of alcohol. The report also noted that the culprit had used a sharp weapon to disembowel her. Jisha was stabbed over 30 times. Her chest was pierced with a dagger. The postmortem conducted at Alappuzha Medical college states that, severe infliction on the neck led to her death. According to forensic officials, samples of blood and saliva recovered have been sent for examination, and DNA is recorded for matching.Upon preliminary investigation, the police revealed that Jisha would have been murdered when she resisted the rape attempt. The investigators also probed into migrant workers in the area for any clue on the murder.Case impact The crime took place in the backdrop of the Kerala Legislative elections, and hence gained momentum and focus from political parties. As a woman brutally murdered in her home in Perumbavoor, Justice for Jisha was the hashtag (#JusticeForJisha) used in the social media during April 2016 to quicken efforts for justice to Jisha by politicians and largely by people. The film industry also joined forces in demanding justice for Jisha. The government has declared to offer a financial consolation of Rs 10 lakh to the family of Jisha and a home will be provided for her parents. Also many artists and humanitarians pledged support to the case.Arrest of murderer Through continuous search of the police and involvement of people, the Jisha murder case came through a breakthrough. A man hailing from Assam informed his doubts about a worker he knew to the Kerala police; following the lead they picked up the Assamese labourer, and learnt that 24-year-old Ameer-ul-Islam was the culprit and was arrested from Kancheepuram in Tamil Nadu. He admitted committing the gruesome murder of the woman in Perumbavoor. Police found that the crime was motivated by previous grudge and revenge and committed under the influence of alcohol. The alcoholic assailant observed Jisha's routine and waited to sexually assault her; in that effort and rage he killed her and when she asked for water moments before death he gave her alcohol that he had with him. DNA tests conducted, matched and the police also recovered the knife used by the perpetrator. Police also suspect Anarul Islam's involvement, a friend of Ameerul Islam who fled after the murder news. He allegedly escaped from Assam before the arrest.Sentencing and aftermath Advocate Biju Antony Aloor (popularly known as Advocate B A Aloor) appeared in the court as the defence lawyer for the accused Ameer ul Islam in the Jisha murder case. Advocate Biju Antony Aloor (popularly known as Advocate B A Aloor) hails from Aloor, a place in the Thrissur district in the Kerala state of India. He has also appeared in the court as the defence lawyer for Govindachamy, the man who was accused of murdering a woman traveling in a train in 2011 in Thrissur.For premeditated murders, rape, and the use of disabling violent force, the verdict is usually life imprisonment or death sentence.The case also has motivated the government to structure a policy to halt differentiating people overly as men and women, which creates stereotyped societal divide and asked media to regulate depictions of gender-negative stereotypes to cultivate gender equity, lessen the crimes as a long-term plan to a certain extent and to regulate yellow journalism in forms of discussions and unnecessary probings through media, primarily to minimize the impact of trauma. This case also made the government to actively saddle on the implementation of alcohol prohibition in a phased manner. The Ernakulam principal district and sessions court, in December 2017, awarded death penalty to Ameer ul-Islam, the sole accused in the case. He was also awarded life term, and rigorous imprisonment of 10 and 7 years.References2016 crimes in India Rape in India Stalking May 2016 crimes in Asia Murder in India 2016 murders in Asia 2010s murders in India Deaths by stabbing in India", "machine_text": "The Jisha murder case was a high-profile murder case that took place in the Indian state of Kerala in April 2016. Jisha, a 30-year-old law student, was found murdered in her home in Perumbavoor, Kerala. The brutal nature of the murder shocked the entire state and led to widespread protests and demands for justice. The investigation into the murder was conducted by the Kerala police and lasted for over a year. The police arrested a migrant worker, Ameerul Islam, in May 2016 in connection with the murder. Islam was charged with rape, murder, and destruction of evidence. The case drew significant media attention, particularly from women's rights groups, who highlighted the issue of violence against women in India. The case also sparked a debate on the issue of safety for women in the country, with many calling for stronger measures to protect women from violence. The trial of Ameerul Islam began in April 2017 and lasted for over a year. The prosecution presented evidence, including DNA samples and witnesses, to prove that Islam was responsible for the murder. In December 2017, the court found Islam guilty of the charges and sentenced him to death. The verdict was welcomed by women's rights groups and the general public, who applauded the police and the judiciary for their efforts in bringing the perpetrator to justice. The case has also led to a renewed focus on the need for better safety measures for women in India and has sparked a national conversation on the issue of violence against women. In conclusion, the Jisha murder case is a tragic but important landmark in the fight against violence against women in India. It has highlighted the urgent need for better safety measures for women and has helped to create greater awareness of the issue across the country.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 50480156}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"European Rugby Champions Cup\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The European Rugby Champions Cup (known as the Heineken Champions Cup for sponsorship reasons) is an annual rugby union tournament organised by European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR). It is the top-tier competition for clubs whose countries' national teams compete in the Six Nations Championship. Clubs qualify for the Heineken Champions Cup via their final positions in their respective national/regional leagues (English Premiership, French Top 14, and United Rugby Championship) or via winning the second-tier Challenge Cup; those that do not qualify are instead eligible to compete in the second-tier Challenge Cup.Between 1995 and 2014, the equivalent competition was known as the Heineken Cup and was run by European Rugby Cup. Following disagreements between its shareholders over the structure and governance of the competition, it was taken over by EPCR and its name was changed to the European Rugby Champions Cup, without title sponsorship. Heineken returned as sponsor for the 2018–19 season, resulting in the competition being known as the Heineken Champions Cup.Toulouse are the current holders of the title, having won their record setting fifth title by beating Stade Rochelais in the 2021 final.HistoryHeineken Cup1995–1999The Heineken Cup was launched in the summer of 1995 on the initiative of the then Five Nations Committee to provide a new level of professional cross border competition. Twelve sides representing Ireland, Wales, Italy, Romania and France competed in four pools of three with the group winners going directly into the semi-finals. English and Scottish teams did not take part in the inaugural competition. From an inauspicious beginning in Romania, where Toulouse defeated Farul Constanţa 54–10 in front of a small crowd, the competition gathered momentum and crowds grew. Toulouse went on to become the first European cup winners, eventually beating Cardiff in extra time in front of a crowd of 21,800 at Cardiff Arms Park.Clubs from England and Scotland joined the competition in 1996–97. European rugby was further expanded with the advent of the European Challenge Cup for teams that did not qualify for the Heineken Cup. The Heineken Cup now had 20 teams divided into four pools of five. Only Leicester and Brive reached the knock-out stages with 100 per cent records and ultimately made it to the final, Cardiff and Toulouse falling in the semi-finals. After 46 matches, Brive beat Leicester 28–9 in front of a crowd of 41,664 at Cardiff Arms Park, the match watched by an estimated television audience of 35 million in 86 countries.The season 1997–98 saw the introduction of a home and away format in the pool games. The five pools of four teams, which guaranteed each team a minimum of six games, and the three quarter-final play-off matches all added up to a 70-match tournament. Brive reached the final again but were beaten late in the game by Bath with a penalty kick. Ironically, English clubs had decided to withdraw from the competition in a dispute over the way it was run.Without English clubs, the 1998–99 tournament revolved around France, Italy and the Celtic nations. Sixteen teams took part in four pools of four. French clubs filled the top positions in three of the groups and for the fourth consecutive year a French club, in the shape of Colomiers from the Toulouse suburbs, reached the final. Despite this it was to be Ulster's year as they beat Toulouse (twice) and reigning French champions Stade Français on their way to the final at Lansdowne Road, Dublin. Ulster then carried home the trophy after a 21–6 win over Colomiers in front of a capacity 49,000 crowd.1999–2004 English clubs returned in 1999–00. The pool stages were spread over three months to allow the competition to develop alongside the nations' own domestic competitions, and the knockout stages were scheduled to take the tournament into the early spring. For the first time clubs from four nations – England, Ireland, France and Wales – made it through to the semi-finals. Munster's defeat of Toulouse in Bordeaux ended France's record of having contested every final and Northampton Saints' victory over Llanelli made them the third English club to make it to the final. The competition was decided with a final between Munster and Northampton, with Northampton coming out on top by a single point to claim their first major honour.England supplied two of the 2000–01 semi-finalists – Leicester Tigers and Gloucester – with Munster and French champions Stade Français also reaching the last four. Both semi-finals were close, Munster going down by a point 16–15 to Stade Français in Lille and the Tigers beating Gloucester 19–15 at Vicarage Road, Watford. The final, at Parc des Princes, Paris, attracted a crowd of 44,000 and the result was in the balance right up until the final whistle, but Leicester walked off 34–30 winners.Munster reached the 2001–02 final with quarter-final and semi-final victories on French soil against Stade Français and Castres. Leicester pipped Llanelli in the last four, after the Scarlets had halted Leicester's 11-match Heineken Cup winning streak in the pool stages. A record crowd saw Leicester become the first side to successfully defend their title.From 2002, the European Challenge Cup winner now automatically qualified for the Heineken Cup. Toulouse's victory over French rivals Perpignan in 2003 meant that they joined Leicester as the only teams to win the title twice. Toulouse saw a 19-point half-time lead whittled away as the Catalans staged a dramatic comeback in a match in which the strong wind and showers played a major role, but Toulouse survived to win.In 2003–04 the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) voted to create regions to play in the Celtic League and represent Wales in European competition. Henceforth, Wales entered regional sides rather than the club sides that had previously competed. English side London Wasps had earned their first final appearance by beating Munster 37–32 in a Dublin semi-final while Toulouse triumphed 19–11 in an all-French contest with Biarritz in a packed Stade Chaban-Delmas in Bordeaux. The 2004 final saw Wasps defeat defending champions Toulouse 27–20 at Twickenham to win the Heineken Cup for the first time. The match was widely hailed as one of the best finals. With extra time looming at 20–20, a late opportunist try by scrum half Rob Howley settled the contest.2005–2014 The tenth Heineken Cup final saw the inaugural champions Toulouse battle with rising stars Stade Français when Murrayfield was the first Scottish venue to host the final. Fabien Galthié's Paris side led until two minutes from the end of normal time before Frédéric Michalak levelled the contest for Toulouse with his first penalty strike. He repeated this in the initial stages of extra time and then sealed his side's success with a superb opportunist drop-goal. Toulouse became the first team to win three Heineken Cup titles.In 2006, Munster defeated Biarritz in the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff, 23–19. It was third time lucky for the Irish provincial side, who had previously been denied the ultimate prize twice by Northampton and Leicester.The 2006–07 Heineken Cup would be distributed to over 100 countries following Pitch International's securing of the rights. That season was the first time in the history of the competition that two teams went unbeaten in pool play, with both Llanelli Scarlets and Biarritz doing so. Biarritz went into their final match at Northampton Saints with a chance to become the first team ever to score bonus-point wins in all their pool matches, but were only able to score two of the four tries needed. Leicester defeated Llanelli Scarlets to move into the final at Twickenham, with the possibility of winning a Treble of championships on the cards, having already won the Anglo-Welsh Cup and the English Premiership. However, Wasps won the final 25 points to 9 in front of a tournament record 81,076 fans.During competition there was uncertainty over the future of the tournament after the 2006–07 season as French clubs had announced that they would not take part because of fixture congestion following the Rugby World Cup and an ongoing dispute between English clubs and the RFU. It was speculated that league two teams might compete the next season, the RFU saying 'If this situation is not resolved, the RFU owes it to the sport to keep this competition going...We have spoken to our FDR clubs, and if they want to compete we will support them.'. A subsequent meeting led to the announcement that the tournament would be played in 2007–08, with clubs from all the six nations. On 20 May it was announced that both French and English top-tier teams would be competingIn the 2008 final, Munster won the cup for their second time ever by beating Toulouse at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.Leinster won the title in 2009 in their first ever final after beating Munster in the semi-final in front of a then world record Rugby Union club match attendance in Croke Park. They beat the Leicester Tigers in the final at Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh. They also beat Harlequins 6–5 in the quarter-finals at Twickenham Stoop, in the famous Bloodgate scandal.In the 2010 final, Toulouse defeated Biarritz Olympique in the Stade de France to claim their fourth title, a Heineken Cup record.The 16th Heineken Cup tournament in 2011 resulted in an Irish province lifting the title for the fourth time in six years as Leinster recorded their second triumph in the competition. They defeated former multiple Heineken Cup winners Leicester and Toulouse in the quarter- and semi-finals. At the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, in front of 72,000 spectators, Leinster fought back from a 22–6 half-time deficit in the final against Northampton Saints, scoring 27 unanswered points in 26 second-half minutes, winning 33–22 in one of the tournament's greatest comebacks. Jonathan Sexton won the man-of-the-match award, having scored 28 of Leinster's points total, which included two tries, three conversions, and four penalties.Leinster successfully defended their crown in 2012 at Twickenham, eclipsing fellow Irish province and former champions Ulster 42–14 to establish the highest Heineken Cup final winning margin. The performance broke a number of Heineken Cup Final records. Leinster became only the second team to win back-to-back titles, and the only team ever to win three championships in four years. In addition, the game had the highest attendance at a final (81,774), the highest number of tries (5) and points (42) scored by one team and the highest points difference (28).The final edition of the tournament as constituted as the Heineken Cup was won for a second time by Toulon at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff in May 2014.Champions Cup2014–18 The tournament began on 17 October 2014, with Harlequins playing Castres Olympique in the first ever Champions Cup game. Toulon retained their title, beating Clermont 24–18 in a repeat of the 2013 Heineken Cup Final, thereby becoming the first club to win three European titles in a row.Following the November 2015 Paris attacks, all Round 1 games due to take place in France that weekend were called off, along with the Round 2 fixture between Stade Français and Munster. Rescheduling of some matches was difficult, partly caused by fixture congestion due to the 2015 Rugby World Cup.Saracens won their first title defeating Racing 92 in Lyon 21–9 in 2016 final and followed it up with their second in 2017, beating Clermont 28–17 in Edinburgh.In 2017–18 season, Leinster overcame the 'pool of death' consisting of Glasgow Warriors (who finished the 2017–18 season top of the Pro14), Montpellier (who finished the 2017–18 season top of the TOP 14) and Exeter (who finished the 2017–18 season top of the English Premiership), beating all three teams both home and away. Leinster went on to face the back to back Champions Saracens, dispatching a defeat at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin, to set up a semi-final against reigning Pro12 champions Scarlets. Leinster defeated Scarlets to face Racing 92 in Champions Cup Final in Bilbao. Leinster defeated Racing 92 by a scoreline of 15–12, becoming only the second team in history to earn four European titles. Leinster also won the Pro14 title to become the first Pro14 side to win such a double of trophies.Heineken Champions Cup2018–2020 Saracens won the 2018–19 competition, defeating defending champions Leinster 20–10 in the final. Saracens were in breach of the Premiership salary cap during this edition and the previous year, in which they qualified for the 2018–19 cup. However, the EPCR have confirmed that Premiership ruling will not affect the results of the Heineken Champions Cup for 2018–19 or previous years, stating: 'The Saracens decision is based on Gallagher Premiership Rugby regulations and does not affect the club's European record or current status in the Heineken Champions Cup.' There were no Saracens representatives at the launch of the 2019–20 competition, held in Cardiff on 6 November 2019. EPCR released a statement saying they were 'disappointed to learn of Saracens' decision to make their club representatives unavailable for today's official 2019–20 season launch'.2020– Because of the COVID-19 pandemic the 2020–21 competition took on a revised format. A similar but revised 24 team format will remain for 2021–22.FormatQualification Typically, a total of 24 teams qualify for the competition, the same number as used to qualify for the Heineken Cup. At least 23 of the 24 teams qualify automatically based on position in their respective leagues. The winner of the Challenge Cup will earn a place regardless of league position.Team distribution is typically: England: 8 teams, based on position in Premiership Rugby France: 8 teams, based on position in the Top 14 Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales: 8 teams, based on performance in the United Rugby Championship (previously the Pro14). From 2014 to 2017, the best placed team from each country in the Pro14 qualified for the competition, along with the best three remaining teams regardless of nationality In 2017, it was announced that this format would change. Starting with qualification for the 2018–19 competition, the Pro14 places would be assigned regardless of nationality, rather than the requirement that at least one team qualify from each participating nation.20th team qualification (-2020)Until 2018–19, the final team each season qualified through a play-off competition between the best placed unqualified teams.For the 2014–15 season, this was a two legged play-off between the seventh-placed teams in the Top 14 and the English Premiership. The team with the highest aggregate score over the two legs advancing to the Champions Cup. For the 2015–16 season, there was a three-team play-off; the seventh-placed team in the English Premiership, or the winners of the 2014–15 European Rugby Challenge Cup if members of the English Premiership and not already qualified, would play the eighth-placed (or highest non-qualified) team from the Pro14, with the winner playing the seventh-placed team in the Top 14. To facilitate Rugby World Cup 2015, there were no play-offs for the 2016–17 Champions Cup with the 20th place going to the winner of the 2016 Challenge Cup if not already qualified. For 2017–18, the play-off format included four clubs with a second Pro14 club competing. If not already qualified, the winner of the Challenge Cup will take the place in the play-offs of the seventh-ranked club in the English Premiership and Top 14, and will also take the place of the second Pro14 club if applicable. In May 2017, it was announced that, starting with qualification for the 2018–19 Champions Cup, the play-off will be scrapped in favour of awarding the final berth using the following criteria: Champions Cup winner, if not already qualified. European Rugby Challenge Cup winner, if not already qualified. Challenge Cup losing finalist, if not already qualified. Challenge Cup semi-finalist, if one has not already qualified (or the winner of a play-off between the semi-finalists, if both have not already qualified). Highest ranked non-qualified club by virtue of league position from the same league as the Champions Cup winner.CompetitionGroup stage For the pool stage teams are placed into pools via a draw. The teams are ranked based on domestic league performance the previous season, and arranged into four tiers. Teams are then drawn from the tiers into pools at random, with the restriction that no team will be drawn in the same pool as another team from the same league and tier.Teams will play two other teams in their pool from a different league twice, at home and away, and match points will be awarded depending on the result of each game, with teams receiving four points for a win, and two for a draw. Teams can also earn bonus points for scoring four or more tries and/or for losing a match by seven points or fewer.Following the completion of the pool stage, 16 teams qualify for the knock-out stage of the Champions Cup with a further 6 of the remaining 8 dropping into the Challenge Cup.Knock-out stage The sixteen remaining teams are seeded from 1–16 based on performance in their respective pool.The round of 16 is played over two legs with each team playing both home and away. The quarter-finals are unbracketed, and follow the standard 1v8, 2v7, 3v6, 4v5 format, as found in the Heineken Cup.The winners of the quarter-finals will contest the two semi-finals, Up to and including the 2014–15 season, matches and home country advantage were determined by a draw by EPCR.In 2015–16, EPCR decided to put a new procedure in place. In lieu of the draw that used to determine the semi-final pairing, EPCR announced that a fixed semi-final bracket would be set in advance, and that the home team would be designated based on 'performances by clubs during the pool stages as well as the achievement of a winning a quarter-final match away from home'. Semi-final matches must have been played at a neutral ground in the designated home team's country.Since 2018–19, the higher-seeded team will have home country/venue advantage for each semi-final regardless of whether they won their quarter-final at home or on the road. The EPRC may now also use its discretion to allow semi-finals to be played at a qualified club's home venue.The winners of the semi-finals will contest the final, which will be held in May each season.2020–Because of the COVID-19 pandemic the 2020–21 competition took on a revised format.A similar format will remain for 2021–22.FinalsWins by clubWins by nationControversyDisagreements over structuregovernance English and French rugby union clubs had long held concerns over the format and structure of the Heineken Cup organised by European Rugby Cup (ERC), predominantly in relation to the distribution of funds and an imbalance in the qualification process. Some proposals had been made that, in future, rather than Ireland, Wales, Scotland and Italy each sending their top-placed teams in the Pro14 to the Heineken Cup, the top teams from the league as a whole should be sent, regardless of nationality. This founding principle was eventually conceded however, when it was agreed that the top-placed teams from the four should participate in the new European competition.In June 2012, following that year's final, Premiership Rugby and the Ligue Nationale de Rugby (LNR), on behalf of the English and French clubs respectively, gave ERC two years' notice of withdrawing from the Heineken Cup and also the second-tier Challenge Cup competitions from the start of the 2014–15 season. Soon after, in September, Premiership Rugby announced a new four-year TV deal worth £152 million with BT Sport including rights for English clubs' European games - which had previously been the sole responsibility of ERC. ERC responded with claims that Premiership Rugby did not have the rights to a European tournament and announced a four-year deal with Sky Sports. The actions of Premiership Rugby were said to have 'thrown northern hemisphere rugby into disarray'.Subsequently, in September 2013, the English and French clubs announced their intention to organise their own tournament, to be named the Rugby Champions Cup, from 2014 to 2015 season onwards, and invited other European clubs, provinces, and regions to join them. The IRB (now World Rugby) stepped into the debate at the same time to announce its opposition to the creation of a breakaway tournament. In October 2013, Regional Rugby Wales, on behalf of the four Welsh regions, confirmed its full support for the proposed new Rugby Champions Cup. Negotiations for both a new Heineken Cup and Rugby Champions Cup were then ongoing.On 10 April 2014, following almost two years of negotiations, a statement was released under the aegis of European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR) announcing that the nine stakeholders to the new competition, the six unions, and three umbrella club organisations (Premiership Rugby, LNR, and Regional Rugby Wales), had signed Heads of Agreement for the formation of the European Rugby Champions Cup, the European Rugby Challenge Cup and a new, third tournament, initially called the Qualifying Competition and now known as the European Rugby Continental Shield. On the same day, BT and Sky announced an agreement that divided coverage of the new European competitions. Both will split the pool matches, quarter-finals, and semi-finals equally, and both will broadcast the final. BT will get first choice of English Premiership club matches in the Champions Cup, with Sky receiving the same privilege for the Challenge Cup.Premiership Rugby and LNR were described as having employed 'bully-boy tactics' by The Irish Times.Organisation Shortly after the establishment of European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR) to administer the new competition from a new base in Neuchatel, Switzerland, the running of the inaugural 2014–15 tournament was subcontracted to the organisation it had been meant to replace, Dublin-based European Rugby Cup (ERC). This was despite the latter having been described by chairman of Premiership Rugby, Quentin Smith, as 'no longer fit for purpose'. This was described as 'something of an about-turn' by The Daily Telegraph.EPCR were still looking to hire a permanent chairman and director-general more than a year after their establishment.2015 final The inaugural Champions Cup final was brought forward by three weeks due to a French desire not to interrupt their domestic playoffs. This was said to have 'devalued' and 'diminished the status of the occasion as the pinnacle of European club rugby'.While the 2015 Heineken Cup final had been due to take place at the San Siro in Milan, the first European final to take place in Italy, the new organisers decided to move it to Twickenham Stadium in London in order to 'guarantee the best possible financial return to clubs'. However, with less than two weeks to go before the final took place, it was reported that fewer than half of the stadium's 82,000 seats had been sold, with just 8,000 French supporters travelling to London to watch Toulon face Clermont. The organisers subsequently made 'free' tickets available on Ticketmaster (with only a £2 booking fee applicable), before admitting to this being a mistake – the offer supposed to have been linked to a purchase of a Premiership final ticket. This was described as an 'embarrassing fiasco' by the Western Mail in Wales. 56,622 fans subsequently attended the game. EPCR were said to have 'failed on many levels' by The Irish Times, with the attendance figure for the final 'a fitting postscript to the hastily-convened decider to what was, after all the brinkmanship, a hastily-convened tournament'.Sponsorship and suppliersSponsors During the creation of the Champions Cup, former organisers ERC had been criticised for 'failing to maximise the commercial potential' of the Heineken Cup. New organisers EPCR pledged to move from a single title sponsor format to a Champions League-style partner system, with 2–3 primary partners projected for the inaugural tournament and 5 being the ultimate target. However, only Heineken agreed to sign up for the 2014–15 season, at a much reduced price from that which they had been paying previously.Principal partners Heineken (1995–2014; 2018–Present)Heineken, who had sponsored the Heineken Cup since 1995, signed on as the first partner for the Champions Cup in 2014, and were credited as the Founding Partner of European Rugby. They returned to the competition as title sponsors in 2018, resulting in it being renamed as the 'Heineken Champions Cup'. Due to French restrictions on alcohol advertising, it is known as the 'H Cup' in France.

Ronan O'Gara received the inaugural award, being recognised as the best player over the first 15 years of ERC tournaments.

The cup is designed around the idea of the star representing European rugby, including the previous 19 seasons of European rugby, as the Heineken Cup.The 13.5 kg, five-handled trophy, creates a star shape when viewed from the top, while when viewed from the side, the top of the trophy has a coronet effect, which designers said was to reflect the crowning of the Kings of Europe.

Coverage was split between the two in order to raise revenues, but this was said to have 'diluted the focus and reduced the buzz around the event'.Attendance This lists the average attendances for each season's European Cup competition, as well as the total attendance and highest attendance for that season. The final is typically the most-attended match, as it is generally held in a larger stadium than any club's home venue.The highest attended match of the 2002–03 competition was a quarter-final between Leinster and Biarritz before 46,000 fans at Lansdowne Road in Dublin.The 2009 final held at Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh was only the third most-attended match that season. The most-attended match was a semi-final between Irish rivals Leinster and Munster played in Croke Park in Dublin. The attendance of 82,208 set what was then a world record for a club match in the sport's history. Second on that season's list was a pool match between Stade Français and Harlequins that drew 76,569 to Stade de France in Paris (a venue that Stade Français has used for select home matches since 2005).While the 2010–11 tournament's highest attended match was unsurprisingly the final, the second-highest attended match was notable in that it was held in Spain. Perpignan hosted Toulon in a quarter-final before a sellout crowd of 55,000 at the Olympic Stadium in Barcelona, Spain.See alsoList of European Rugby Champions Cup finalsEuropean Rugby Challenge CupPremiership (England)United Rugby Championship (Ireland, Italy, Scotland, South Africa and Wales)Top 14 (France)NotesReferencesExternal linksOfficial websiteRugby union competitions in Europe for clubs and provinces 1995 establishments in Europe Recurring sporting events established in 1995 Multi-national professional rugby union leagues Multi-national professional sports leagues", "machine_text": "The European Rugby Champions Cup (ERCC) is an annual elite rugby union competition held among professional clubs from Europe's top rugby nations. It is considered to be one of the most prestigious club rugby tournaments in the world, and it serves as the replacement for the Heineken Cup, which was last held in 2014. The competition features 20 teams from six different nations, including England, Ireland, Wales, Scotland, France, and Italy. These teams are divided into four pools of five teams each, and they play each other in a round-robin format. The top four teams from each pool advance to the knockout stage, which consists of quarterfinals, semifinals, and a final. The ERCC was first held in the 2014-2015 season, after the decision was made to replace the Heineken Cup. The tournament is organized by the European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR), which was established in 2014 following a breakaway from the European Rugby Cup (ERC). Several top clubs have dominated the competition since its inception, including Toulon, who won the first three editions of the tournament. Saracens have also been a force in recent years, winning the competition in 2016, 2017, and 2019. Other notable winners include Leinster, who have won the tournament four times, and Toulouse, who have won it three times. The ERCC is considered to be a major event in the rugby world, and it has been the subject of much controversy in recent years. The format of the tournament has been a source of frustration for many club owners, who have complained about the long travel distances and the scheduling of matches. Despite this, the competition remains one of the most exciting events in the rugby calendar, and it attracts some of the biggest names in the sport.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 40682953}

Increase in trafficexplains the digging up and creation of four more; the Nouveau Bassin (cruises), Bassin de Calix, Bassin de Hérouville (miscellaneous) and Bassin de Blainville (cereals). A new canal, as well as a new concert venue (the Cargö), were built next to the junction between the Canal and the Bassin Saint-Pierre, creating a sharp contrast with the disused warehouses.The Bassin Saint-Pierre is used as a marina and is kept afloat with a height adjustable dam on the River Orne. The Nouveau Bassin, directly east of Saint-Pierre, although it receives cruise ships and ferries in need of berthing or repairs, is not in regular use.The Viaduc de Calix, a large concrete viaduct, passes over the Orne valley and the canal. It has been built high enough to permit the transit of large tonnage ships. The Bassin de Calix, directly below the viaduct, is the only basin in regular use. Several cranes are used to load and unload cargo, mostly wood, onto lorries or trains.Ships transporting cereals use Blainville wharf. Ships are stationed directly against the canal wall and load and unloaded by cranes and cereal silos.Ouistreham At the entrance of the canal is the Port of Caen's cross-channel ferry port.The terminal building is situated in the western part of the terminal. Two sets of locks, beyond the seaport, keep the canal navigable towards Caen. The lock is composed to two lock basins and a lock keeper's tower.The entrance to the port is a dredged channel, 8 m deep, below the hydrographic zero and 90 m long. The access channel itself is two nautical miles (4 km) long, on a 184°5 axis, indicated by aligned luminous signalling. The channel, 150 m wide is bordered, to the west and the east by three sea mark buoys.The outer harbour is a 250 m in diameter avoidance zone, permitting ferries to turn around.Ouistreham possesses two ferry berths; Poste T1 and Poste T2.Poste T1 was built in 1986, it is capable of berthing ships up to 145 m long and 24 m wide. The minimum water depth is 5 m 50 cm at low tide.Poste T2 was built in 1992, it is capable of berthing ferries up to 165 m long and 26 m wide, on a dock wall 217 m long. Depth is kept at a minimum of 6 m above hydrographic zero.The tugboat is stationed between posts T1 and T2 in a 38 m long secluded.The terminal itself is divided in two areas, T1 and T2, respectively 15 400 m² and 56 100 m² in area. The terminal's total area is 100 000 m².Brittany Ferries Up to three sailings of Brittany Ferries depart Ouistreham per day. It is the Port of Caen's English Channel ferry port.In the summer season, the MV Normandie and MV Mont St Michel operate the back-to-back, six-hour ferry crossing. Ferries depart both Ouistreham and Portsmouth International Port at 08:15 (and arrive at 14:30), 16:30 (and arrive at 21:15) and 22:00 (and arrive the next morning).This schedule begins in May and is carried through until October, when ferries start to go in for refits; hence they are deployed on different routes.Pleasure boating The traffic has decreased during the last twenty years. The port of Caen has however been used to accommodate several racing yachts such as the Kingfisher (2nd - Vendée Globe 2001, sailed by Ellen MacArthur, and 1st Route du Rhum 2002) and Gartmore (9th - Vendée Globe 2001). As well as racing ships, the port of Caen is the regular port-of-call for sailing ships, the Belem and the HMY Britannia.Statistics During July 2006 the Port of Caen transported 317 274 tons of cargo and 133 959 passengers (32 538 cars and 9 483 lorries).Between 2004 and 2006, the Port of Caentransported (in tons per year):ReferencesExternal linksLe Port de CaenA la découverte du Port de CaenPorts and harbours of the English Channel Ports and harbours of France Caen Transport in Normandy Buildings and structures in Caen Tourist attractions in Normandy", "machine_text": "Port of Caen, located on the north coast of France, is one of the major commercial ports in the country. It is situated on the Canal de Caen a la Mer, which connects the city of Caen to the English Channel. The port handles a wide variety of cargo, including grain, building materials, and petroleum products, as well as serving as a base for fishing fleets. The port was established in the 14th century and has been a crucial transportation hub for the region ever since. In the early years, it was primarily used for the export of local goods such as grain and wool. In the 19th century, the construction of a rail link to the port led to an expansion in trade, with imports of coal, timber, and iron ore. During World War II, the port was a vital supply line for the Allied forces, with the port being heavily bombed during the Battle for Caen in 1944. After the war, the port was rebuilt and modernized to meet the demands of modern shipping. Today, the port is an important center for container shipping, with regular services to destinations all over the world. It also supports the local fishing industry, with a thriving fishing fleet based at the port. The port has undergone significant investment in recent years, with the construction of new container terminals and the expansion of its existing facilities to accommodate larger vessels. The Port of Caen is also a major tourist destination, with its historic waterfront and proximity to the D-Day Landing beaches attracting visitors from all over the world. The port is also a popular destination for cruise ships, with many visiting the nearby cities of Bayeux and Rouen. In conclusion, the Port of Caen plays a significant role in the economic and social life of the region, connecting it to the wider world and providing essential transport links for a variety of industries.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Ulnar collateral ligament injury of the elbow\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Ulnar collateral ligament injuries can occur during certain activities such as overhead baseball pitching. Acute or chronic disruption and/or attenuation of the ulnar collateral ligament often result in medial elbow pain, valgus instability, neurologic deficiency, and impaired throwing performance. There are both non-surgical and surgical treatment options.Signs and symptomsPain along the inside of the elbow is the main symptom of this condition. Throwing athletes report it occurs most often during the acceleration phase of throwing. Closing the hand and clenching the fist has also been shown to reproduce the painful symptoms. The injury is often associated with an experience of a sharp “pop” in the elbow, followed by pain during a single throw.In addition, swelling and bruising of the elbow, loss of elbow range of motion, and a sudden decrease in throwing velocity are all common symptoms of a UCL injury. If the injury is less severe, pain can be minimal with complete rest.Causes The UCL is important because it stabilizes the elbow from being abducted. If intense or repeated bouts of valgus stress occur on the UCL, injury will most likely transpire. Damage to the ulnar collateral ligament is common among baseball pitchers and javelin throwers because the throwing motion is similar. Physicians believe repetitive movements, especially pitching in baseball, cause adolescents' UCL injuries. Furthermore, physicians have stated that if an adolescent throws over 85 throws for 8 months or more in a year, or throw when exhausted, the adolescent has a significantly higher risk of succumbing to a UCL surgery. Gridiron football, racquet sports, ice hockey and water polo players have also been treated for damage to the ulnar collateral ligament. Specific overhead movements like those that occur during baseball pitching, tennis serving or volleyball spiking increase the risk of UCL injury. During the cocking phase of pitching, the shoulder is horizontally abducted, externally rotated and the elbow is flexed. There is slight stress on the UCL in this position but it increases when the shoulder is further externally rotated. The greater the stress the more the UCL is stretched causing strain. During the overhead throwing motion, valgus stress on the medial elbow occurs during arm cocking and acceleration. The initiation of valgus stress occurs at the conclusion of the arm-cocking phase. In the transitional moment from arm cocking to arm acceleration, the shoulder vigorously rotates internally, the forearm is in near full supination, and the elbow flexes from 90° to approximately 125°. From late cocking to ball release, the elbow rapidly extends from approximately 125° to 25° at ball release. This causes tremendous valgus stress and tensile strain on the UCL. Injuries to the ulnar collateral ligament are believed to result from poor throwing mechanics, overuse, high throwing velocities, and throwing certain types of pitches, such as curveballs. Poor mechanics along with high repetition of these overhead movements can cause irritation, micro-tears or ruptures of the UCL.Kinetic chain dysfunction due to poor lower extremity strength, core strength and stability can be associated with UCL injuries as well as capsular stiffness in glenohumeral internal rotation deficit (GIRD), and scapular dyskinesis. Injuries to the Ulnar Collateral Ligament in baseball players are rarely due to one-time, traumatic events. Rather, they are more often due to small chronic tears that accumulate over time.AnatomyThe ulnar collateral ligament (UCL, also known as medial collateral ligament) is located on the medial side of the elbow. The UCL complex comprises three ligaments: the anterior oblique, posterior oblique and transverse ligaments. The anterior oblique ligament (AOL) attaches from the undersurface of the medial epicondyle to the medial ulnar surface slightly below the coronoid process. It is the sturdiest of the three sections within the UCL. The AOL acts as the primary restraint against valgus stress at the elbow during flexion and extension. The posterior oblique originates at the medial epicondyle and inserts along the mid-portion of the medial semilunar notch. It applies more stability against valgus stress when the elbow is flexed rather than extended. The transverse ligament connects to the inferior medial coronoid process of the ulna to the medial tip of the olecranon. Since it is connected to the same bone and not across the elbow joint, the transverse ligament has no contribution to the joint’s stability.Diagnosis In most cases, a physician will diagnose an ulnar collateral ligament injury using a patient’s medical history and a physical examination that includes a valgus stress test. The valgus stress test is performed on both arms and a positive test is indicated by pain on the affected arm that is not present on the uninvolved side.Physicians often utilize imaging techniques such as ultrasound, x-rays and magnetic resonance imaging or arthroscopic surgery to aid with making a proper diagnosis.Classification A slow and chronic deterioration of the ulnar collateral ligament can be due to repetitive stress acting on the ulna.At first, pain can be bearable and can worsen to an extent where it can terminate an athlete’s career.The repetitive stress placed on the ulna causes micro tears in the ligament resulting in the loss of structural integrity over time.The acute rupture is less common compared to the slow deterioration injury.The acute rupture occurs in collisions when the elbow is in flexion such as that in a wrestling match or a tackle in football.The ulnar collateral ligament distributes over fifty percent of the medial support of the elbow.This can result in an ulnar collateral ligament injury or a dislocated elbow causing severe damage to the elbow and the radioulnar joints.TreatmentsUCL injuries may or may not require surgery.Non surgical treatment will primarily focus on strengthening the elbow joint to regain strength and stability. First a course ofRICE (Rest, ice, compression, elevation) is typically coupled with NSAIDS (Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) to help alleviate pain and swelling.When the swelling has subsided, individual exercises or physical therapy may be prescribed to strengthen muscles around the elbow joint to compensate for tearing in the UCL. These may include biceps curls (non resistance and resistance), pronating and supinating the forearm, and grip strengthening exercises, performed with low resistance and moderate repetitions no more than three times a week.Surgical treatment may help restore the ability to perform the overhand throwing motions most commonly associated with UCL injuries. The reconstructive surgery, generally known as Tommy John surgery, was first performed by Dr. Frank Jobe in 1974 and has modified several times over the past 30 years. The surgery involves an autograft of the palmaris longus tendon (mostly seen as an accessory tendon) or an allograft of tissue from a cadaver or donor.The new tendon is attached by drilling holes in the medial epicondyle of the humerus and the sublime tubercle of the ulna and lacing the tendon through them in a figure eight. The patient may begin physical therapy shortly after. It usually takes about 15 months after the surgery for standard rehabilitation. Rehabilitation following UCL injuries or surgery should follow a sequential and progressive multi-phased approach that involves a gradual and protected return of range-of-motion (ROM). The rehab program should include proprioceptive exercises to stimulate mechanoreceptors as well as arm strengthening, emphasizing proximal scapular stabilization. Low-resistance, high-repetition programs promote an optimal return to uncompensated throwing.Post-operative treatment is related to the restoration of normal scapulohumeral rhythm, which begins with establishing trunk stability, elbow range of motion and strength as well as balance exercises.In study conducted by Dr. Frederick Azar, 78 Tommy John surgeries were performed and analyzed after the surgeries. Of the 78 patients, 8 of them (8.8", "machine_text": "The ulnar collateral ligament injury of the elbow, also known as UCL injury, is a common injury that occurs in athletes who engage in overhead throwing sports, such as baseball and softball. The UCL is a band of tissue that connects the bone of the upper arm (humerus) to the bone of the forearm (ulna), and helps stabilize the elbow joint during throwing. Causes and Symptoms The most common cause of UCL injury is repetitive overhead throwing motion, which can lead to overuse of the ligament and eventual tearing. Symptoms may include pain on the inside of the elbow, swelling, and weakness or loss of grip strength. Diagnosis and Treatment Diagnosis of UCL injury may involve physical examination by a healthcare provider, as well as imaging tests such as X-rays and MRI scans. Treatment may include rest, physical therapy, and a customized exercise program designed to strengthen the muscles around the elbow. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to repair or reconstruct the damaged ligament. Prevention Prevention of UCL injury may involve proper training and technique when engaging in overhead throwing sports, as well as proper conditioning and rest. Adequate rest and recovery time should be allowed for any soreness or pain in the elbow, and throwing should be resumed gradually and with caution. Conclusion UCL injury of the elbow is a common injury that can have significant impact on athletic performance and quality of life. With proper training, technique, and care, UCL injury can be prevented and treated effectively.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 34609402}

The Americans played 15 first-class matches captained by George Stuart Patterson.The match the Philadelphians played against the MCC was to be Patterson's last first-class cricket match. The tour introduced American bowler J Barton King to the international cricketing world.Tour resultsThis tour was a very ambitious one for the Americans. They had last toured the British Isles in 1889. Though the results may have been less satisfactory than hoped for by promoters, the tour was arranged mainly for educational purposes and few of those on the American side expected to win many matches. Previous tours had tended to involve amateur English sides with a relatively low level of competition. In 1897 a schedule was made including all of the top county cricket teams, the Oxford and Cambridge University teams, the Marylebone Cricket Club, and two other sides, though only a few of the counties thought it worthwhile to put their best elevens onto the field. While it initially aroused some curiosity, many English fans lost interest until Bart King and the Philadelphians met the full Sussex team at Brighton on 17 June. In the first innings, King proved his batting worth on a fourth-wicket stand of 107 runs with John Lester. He then took 7 wickets for 13 runs and the team dismissed Sussex for 46 in less than an hour. In the second innings, King took 6 for 102 and helped the Philadelphians to a victory by 8 wickets.Despite the excitement surrounding King's performance, the Americans did not fare well overall. Fifteen matches were played, but only two were won while the team lost nine and earned a draw on four. The other win of the tour came against Warwickshire. During this match King again shined by taking 5 for 95 and 7 for 72 and scoring 46 runs. According to the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack King proved himself to be the best bowler on the American side and had to do much of the work. He bowled three hundred overs more than anyone else. His average was just over 24 runs each for 72 wickets. In addition to his work bowling, King scored 441 runs with an average of just over 20. Captain George Patterson's best innings batting was 162 runs at Trent Bridge against Nottinghamshire.Controversy Having returned home from the tour, there were claims in the Philadelphia Public Ledger that the Philadelphians had been treated unfairly by the English umpires, but Patterson put those rumors to rest with a letter to the editor of an American newspaper: My attention has been directed to a letter signed W.S. in the Field of July 24th, enclosing a clipping from the Philadelphia Public Ledger, severely criticising the umpiring in the Philadelphian matches during our tour through England. I wish to state on behalf of the Philadelphia team that the sentiments expressed in the clipping are not those of the team, and that we emphatically repudiate any insinuation of unfair treatment. On the contrary, we have been received with the most unvarying courtesy and fairness both on and off the field. I wish to take this opportunity of making a public acknowledgement of our indebtedness to Mr. Perkins, of the M.C.C., for the umpires assigned to us, and to testify, unnecessary though it be, to their ability and integrity. The calming words from Patterson on the issue seem to have defused the situation in Philadelphia.See alsoUnited States cricket teamReferencesExternal links1897 in English cricket International cricket competitions from 1888–89 to 1918 English cricket seasons from 1890 to 1918 1897 United States cricket in the 19th century June 1897 sports events July 1897 sports events", "machine_text": "The Philadelphian cricket team in England in 1897 was a tour undertaken by a team of cricketers from the United States to compete against various English teams.

Fry, who was widely regarded as one of the best cricketers of his time. The team included several other notable players, such as Bart King, John Lester, and J.B. King, among others. The tour included matches against various English county teams, including Yorkshire, Surrey, and Oxford University, among others. The Philadelphians' performances in these matches were generally competitive but ultimately unsuccessful. They were able to achieve some notable victories, such as their win against Yorkshire, but they were also subjected to some heavy defeats, such as their 10-wicket loss to Surrey.

It was planned to be launched on a Japanese M-V rocket from the Kagoshima Space Center.History The vehicle would have been cylindrical, with a diameter of 2.2 m and a height of 1.7 m. It would have had four solar panels and was engineered to be spin-stabilized. Plans called for it to enter an elliptical orbit around the Moon, and deploy two penetrators at an altitude of 40 km on opposite sides of the lunar body. The penetrators were to have been braked by a small rocket at an altitude of 25 km, then free fall to the surface. They were designed to withstand a collision speed of 330 meters per second to deeply penetrate the lunar regolith.Once the penetrators deployed, the LUNAR-A spacecraft was mission-planned to maneuver to an orbital altitude of 200 km above the lunar surface. The craft was to have carried a monochromatic imaging camera with a resolution of 30 m.See alsoJapan Aerospace Exploration AgencyMoonFuture lunar missionsExploration of the MoonReferencesExternal linksJAXA pageISAS pageNASA Page about LUNAR-ALUNAR-A Mission Profile by NASA's Solar System ExplorationMissions to the Moon Japanese space probes Cancelled space probes Japanese Lunar Exploration Program", "machine_text": "Lunar-A was a Japanese lunar orbiter mission that aimed to study the Moon's magnetic and gravitational fields, and to search for evidence of lunar volcanism. The mission was launched on September 14, 2007, but unfortunately, it never reached its target due to a malfunction in the rocket's third stage. Lunar-A was developed by the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), which is a division of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). The spacecraft was designed to be in a polar orbit around the Moon, measuring the magnetic and gravitational fields and the composition of the Moon's crust. It carried a series of sensitive scientific payloads, including a magnetometer, a plasma analyzer, and a dust detector. Lunar-A was also equipped with four penetrators that would have been fired into the lunar surface to a depth of around 2 meters (6.6 ft). These penetrators would have analyzed the Moon's internal structure and temperature, and measure its seismic activity. The mission's main scientific objective was to study the Moon's magnetic and gravitational fields, which would have helped to understand the Moon's internal structure and its evolution. It was hoped that Lunar-A would have provided valuable new insights into how the Moon was formed and how it has changed over time. Despite the mission's failure, the data gathered during the launch sequence helped to improve Japan's rocket technology. Lunar-A was succeeded by the SELENE spacecraft, which launched in 2007 and successfully orbited the Moon until 2009, carrying 14 scientific instruments. The mission provided new insights into the Moon's geology, tectonic activity, and its possible water resources.

In 1665, he murdered the voivode of Ilimsk for raping his daughter, and fled to the Amur where he reoccupied the ruins of Albazin and gathered a band of supporters forming the state of Jaxa.Life Nicefor Czernichowski became a Russian prisoner in 1633 during the battle near Novhorod-Siverskyi (most likely together with his father, Roman); his name was mentioned in the Russian chronicle Razriad. In August 1633 he was exiled to Vologda. Due to a peace treaty ending the Polish-Russian war in 1634 he was entitled to be liberated. As he married a woman from Moscow, he initially intended to stay in Muscovy; he swore loyalty to the Tsar and in 1635 he converted to Orthodoxy.He later changed his mind and in the company of 7 companions, he headed towards the Polish border. He may or may not been aware that he was no longer entitled to return to his homeland, at least in the eyes of the Tsar. On 3 July 1636, he was captured and exiled to Yeniseysk, arriving in 1637 and accompanied by his wife. In 1649, he was sent further east to Ilimsk, then to Ust-Kut and Kirensk. He went on to have three sons and two daughters during this time. In 1656 he became leader of the cossacks. His address to Tsar to restore his noble status was left unanswered in 1657.In 1664, the voivode of Ilimsk, Lawrentij Obuhov, raped his daughter, Pelagia, who was the wife of Foma Kirylow. In an act of revenge, Nicefor murdered Obuhov in 1665. Nicefor subsequently was outlawed; he organized a group of 84 cossacks, including the orthodox monk Hermogenes, and traveled towards the Amur river bordering China, where he settled at the ruins of Albazin.State of JaxaNicefor founded a petty kingdom among the local Daur people. His new domain stretched down the river to the mouth of the Zeya River, 500 km from Albazin. The state was called Jaxa – derived from Nicefor's coat of arms. Monk Hermogenes wrote down the Code of Law.From the beginning, Nicefor's international position was peculiar – his state was not recognized by Russia nor China. The state consisted of only 500 people. After initial struggles with Russia, he unilaterally recognized the overlordship of the Tsar in 1669. In 1670 he defended his state against a Chinese expedition. In 1672 the Tsar issued a death sentence against Nicefor that was followed by an act of mercy two days later. In 1674, Nicefor Czernichowski was nominated for the position of voivod in charge of Albazin. In 1675, he was called by the Daur that had been resettled in Manchuria by the Chinese and wanted to return to join the state of Jaxa again. Most likely, he died during the expedition to Manchuria.This Jaxa state was internationally recognized and was visited by diplomats of France and the Netherlands, like Nicolaes Witsen.External linksNikifor Romanov ChernigovskyReferences1670s deaths Year of birth unknown Polish nobility People from Cherniakhiv Raion People from Kiev Voivodeship Converts to Eastern Orthodoxy from Catholicism Polish exiles in the Russian Empire National founders Outlaws", "machine_text": "Nikifor Chernigovsky was a pioneering Ukrainian composer and conductor who helped to establish and develop classical music in Ukraine during the first half of the 20th century.

He later attended the Kyiv Conservatory, where he studied composition and conducting with some of the leading musicians of the day. Chernigovsky went on to become a prolific composer, creating symphonies, operas, choral works, and other pieces that reflected his deep appreciation for Ukrainian folk music and culture. He also served as a conductor for several orchestras, including the Kyiv Philharmonic and the Lviv Opera. In 1937, he was awarded the title of National Artist of Ukraine, one of the highest honors a Ukrainian musician could receive. Chernigovsky's career was cut short by his untimely death in 1941, at the age of 37. He was killed by a bomb that landed in his apartment during the German invasion of Ukraine in World War II. His works continued to be performed and celebrated in Ukraine throughout the Soviet era and into the present day, and he is now recognized as one of the most important figures in Ukrainian classical music. Among Chernigovsky's most famous works are his Symphony No. 2, which incorporates elements of Ukrainian folk music into its sweeping Romantic melodies, and his opera 'Taras Bulba,' which tells the story of a 17th-century Ukrainian Cossack leader and his struggle against Polish oppression.

Belonging to the Lentibulariaceae family, this species is also commonly known as Andong Bladderwort. The species was first described by botanist Masahiro Kato in 1988. It is a small and terrestrial plant that derives its name from the presence of small, bladder-like traps called utricles that are found on its roots. These traps are highly specialized and allow the plant to capture small organisms like insect larvae and microorganisms that are present in the soil. The leaves of Utricularia andongensis grow at the base of the plant and are round in shape. The flowers are yellow in color and grow on short stems that arise from the center of the leaves. The plant typically flowers from July to September. One of the interesting features of this plant is the way it reproduces. Like other bladderworts, Utricularia andongensis can produce asexual propagules called turions, which allow the plant to survive unfavorable conditions like winter or drought. These turions can be found growing on the leaves or in the soil nearby the plant. Utricularia andongensis is classified as a threatened species due to habitat loss and degradation.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Otto Strasser\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Otto Johann Maximilian Strasser (also , see ß; 10 September 1897 – 27 August 1974) was a German politician and an early member of the Nazi Party. Otto Strasser, together with his brother Gregor Strasser, was a leading member of the party's left-wing faction, and broke from the party due to disputes with the dominant Hitlerite faction. He formed the Black Front, a group intended to split the Nazi Party and take it from the grasp of Hitler. This group also functioned during his exile and World War II as a secret opposition group.His brand of Nazism is now known as Strasserism.CareerBorn at Bad Windsheim in the Kingdom of Bavaria, Otto Strasser took an active part in World War I (1914-1918). On 2 August 1914 he joined the Bavarian Army as a volunteer. He rose through the ranks to lieutenant and was twice wounded. He returned to Germany in 1919, where he served in the Freikorps that in May 1919 put down the Bavarian Soviet Republic, which was organized on the principles of workers' councils. About this time he joined the Social Democratic Party. In 1920 he participated in the opposition to the Kapp Putsch, but he grew increasingly alienated with his party's reformist stance, particularly when it put down a workers' uprising in the Ruhr, and he left the party later that year. In 1925 he joined the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP), in which his brother Gregor had been a member for several years, and worked for its newspaper as a journalist, ultimately taking it over with his brother. He focused particularly on the socialist elements of theparty's program and led the party's left faction in northern Germany together with his brother and Joseph Goebbels. His faction advocated support forstrikes, nationalization of banks and industry, and – despite acknowledged differences – closer ties with the Soviet Union. Hitler opposed some of these policies, judging them too radical and too alienating from parts of the German people (middle class and Nazi-supporting nationalist industrialists in particular), and the Strasser faction suffered defeat at the Bamberg Conference (1926), with Joseph Goebbels joining Hitler. Humiliated, Otto Strasser nonetheless, along with Gregor, continued as a leading Left Nazi within the party until Hitler expelled him from the NSDAP in 1930.After expulsion Following his expulsion, he set up his own party, the Black Front, composed of like-minded former NSDAP members, in an attempt to split the Nazi Party. His party proved unable to counter Hitler's rise to power in 1933, and Strasser spent the years of the Nazi era in exile. The Nazi Left itself was annihilated during the Night of the Long Knives in 1934 – in which his brother Gregor Strasser was killed – leaving Hitler as undisputed party leader and able to pacify both industrialists and the military into accepting his new Nazi regime. In addition to the Black Front, Strasser at this time headed theFree German Movement outside Germany; this group (founded in 1941) sought to enlist the aid of Germans throughout the world in bringing about the downfall of Hitler and his vision of Nazism.Exile Strasser fled first to Austria, then to Czechoslovakia (Prague), Switzerland, and France. In 1940 he went to Bermuda by way of Portugal, leaving a wife and two children behind in Switzerland. In 1941 he emigrated to Canada, where he became the famed 'Prisoner of Ottawa'. During this time, Goebbels denounced Strasser as the Nazis' 'Public Enemy Number One' and a price of 500,000 was set on his head. He settled for a time in Montreal. In 1942, he lived for a time inClarence, Nova Scotia, on a farm owned by a German-speaking Czech, Adolph Schmidt, then moved to nearbyParadise, where he lived for more than a decade in a rented apartment above a general store. As an influential and uncondemned former Nazi Party member still faithful to many doctrines of Nazism, he was initially prevented from returning to West Germany after the war, first by theAllied powers and then by theWest German government.During his exile, he wrote articles on Nazi Germany and its leadership for several British, American, and Canadian newspapers, including the New Statesman, and a series for the Montreal Gazette, which was ghostwritten by then-Gazette reporter and later politician Donald C. MacDonald.Return to Germany and death In 1950 East Germany invited Strasser to become a member of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, but he declined, hoping that he would be permitted to return to Bavaria, which had been under US occupation until 1949. In his view, West Germany constituted an American colony and East Germany a Russian colony. He eventually gained West German citizenship and settled in Munich.He attempted to create a new 'nationalist and socialist'-oriented party in 1956, the German Social Union (often called a successor to the 1949–1952, eventually forbidden Socialist Reich Party of Germany), but his organization was unable to attract any support. For the rest of his life, Strasser continued to advocate forStrasserite Neo-Nazism until he died in Munich in 1974.Otto Strasser claimed he was a dissenting Nazi regarding racial policies. Throughout his life, he claimed to have actively opposed such policies within the Nazi movement, for example, by organizing the removal of Julius Streicher from the German Völkisch Freedom Party.Written worksHitler and I (translated by Eric Mosbacher and Gwenda David) [Hitler und Ich.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Universal Television\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Universal Television LLC (abbreviated as UTV) is an American television production company that is a subsidiary of Universal Studio Group, a division of Comcast's NBCUniversal. It serves as the network television production arm of NBC; a predecessor of the company previously assumed such functions, and a substantial portion of the company's shows air on the network. It was formerly known as Revue Studios, Universal Pictures Television Department, Universal-International Television, Studios USA Television LLC, Universal Network Television, Universal Domestic Television, NBC Universal Television Studio, and Universal Media Studios. Re-established in 2004, both NBC Studios and the original Universal Television are predecessors of the current Universal Television, formerly known as NBC Universal Television Studio and Universal Media Studios.Universal Television Alternative StudioUniversal Television Alternative Studio (”Universal Television Alternative” according to the company's on-screen logo) is a television production company owned by Universal Television made in 2016. The unit reports to the president of alternative and reality group, NBC Entertainment Meredith Ahr.The studio was formed in June 2016 under president Meredith Ahr. In July 2016, the studio's first program, World of Dance was announced by NBC. The studio sold its first show to another channel In Search Of... to History.The studio, as did Universal TV, signed a first-look agreement with Chelsea Handler in March 2018. Both production units signed that same year in August an overall agreement with Eddie Schmidt.In November 2018, Ahr became president of alternative and reality group, NBC Entertainment. Ahr was replaced as the studio's president in August 2019 by Toby Gorman, last the interim CEO of Magical Elves. From Endemol Shine North America, Georgie Hurford-Jones was hired in December 2019 as executive vice president of current programming.Mario Lopez moved from hosting Extra to NBCUniversal's Access Hollywood in July 2019 with production deal with Universal TV and Universal TV Alternative Studio. His first project, Menudo an hour-long competition show, under the deal was announced to be in development in April 2020.BackgroundRevue Studios Revue Productions (later known as Revue Studios) was founded in 1943 by MCA Inc. to produce live radio shows and also produced 'Stage Door Canteen' live events for the United Service Organizations (USO) during World War II. Revue was re-launched as MCA's television production subsidiary in 1950. The partnership of NBC and Revue extends as far back as September 6, 1950, with the television broadcast of Armour Theatre, based on radio's Stars Over Hollywood. MCA bought the Universal Studios lot in 1958 and was renamed Revue Studios. Following its merger with Decca Records, the then-parent of Universal Pictures, the studio backlot name was changed back to Universal. In 1963, MCA formed Universal City Studios to merge the Motion Picture and Television arms of both Universal Pictures and Revue Studios and Revue was officially renamed Universal Television in 1963.During the early years of television, Revue was responsible for producing and/or distributing many television programs. These included Leave It to Beaver, which ran for only one season on CBS before going to ABC from 1958 until 1963. In addition, Revue also made Alan Hale Jr.'s Biff Baker, U.S.A. (1952–1953) and all three of Rod Cameron's syndicated series, City Detective (1953–1955), State Trooper (1956–1959), and Coronado 9 (1960–1961) and the Bill Williams western series, The Adventures of Kit Carson (1951–1955). It produced Bachelor Father (1957–1962), for 'Bachelor Productions', Edmond O'Brien's syndicated crime film Johnny Midnight, based on a fictitious New York City actor-turned-private investigator. Another of its offerings was the 52-episode Crusader, the first Brian Keith series, which ran on CBS 1955–1956. Another western produced by Revue and starring Audie Murphy was Whispering Smith (NBC, 1959/61), based on the 1948 Alan Ladd movie of the same name. Leave It to Beaver was produced first by George Gobel's Golmaco Productions, then by Kayro Productions on a back lot at Revue Studios from 1958 to 1963. Also McHale's Navy was produced by Revue from 1962 to 1966.In December 1958, MCA/Revue purchased Universal Studios's 367-acre backlot to produce television series, then leased it back to Universal for a million dollars a year for a decade.Revue produced later seasons of The Jack Benny Program for CBS and NBC and in co-operation with Jack Benny's J and M productions Checkmate, General Electric Theater and Alfred Hitchcock Presents for CBS, Studio 57 for DuMont Television Network, and westerns such as Tales of Wells Fargo, The Restless Gun and Laramie for NBC, as well as Wagon Train for NBC and ABC, and the first two seasons of NBC's The Virginian, based on a film released originally by Paramount Pictures, whose pre-1950 theatrical sound feature film library was sold to MCA in 1957. Wagon Train was the only Revue-produced TV show ever to finish an American television season in first place.NBC Television Network/NBC Productions/NBC Studios NBC Television Network was founded in 1947 by RCA (NBC's former parent company). In 1955, NBC acquired production company Kagran Corporation, and by 1956, changed its company name to California National Productions. The company also brought several NBC-aired programs, like The Adventures of Hiram Holliday and The Lawless Years, as well as non-NBC programs like The Silent Service and Philip Marlowe, but none of them were successful. The company's first hit was the television show Bonanza, which lasted from 1959 to 1973 on the NBC television network. Its follow-up project that was produced independently was Outlaws, a western from 1960 to 1962. The third independently produced NBC show, The Americans, which aired only in 1961, lasted a few episodes, and bombed after only one season.In 1961, California National changes its name to NBC Films, and in 1963, launched NBC Productions to continue producing its existing show Bonanza, and develop newer projects for the network. NBC developed and produced several shows internally like Kentucky Jones, Captain Nice and T.H.E. Cat. By 1966, the company had output talent deals with Sheldon Leonard, Bob Finkel, Norman Felton and David Dortort. The next big project was The High Chaparral, which was a hit among viewers throughout its four-season run, only to be axed in 1971 due to the rural purge. Throughout its partnership with Sheldon Leonard, they produced three shows Accidental Family, My Friend Tony and My World and Welcome to It, but none of them were successful. By 1974, NBC is producing the next big hit Little House on the Prairie.By the 1980s, NBC is producing Punky Brewster, which was popular among viewers. NBC's production output was primarily on television movies and miniseries. NBC's other television series output were Sara and Roomies, both of them were unsuccessful. In 1985, Michael Filerman through his Michael Filerman Productions company inked a deal with NBC Productions to develop long-form telemovies and miniseries, as well as television series. In the late 1980s, NBC Productions attempted to get into the film business, but it was proven unsuccessful, after the failure of the film Codename: Emerald. In 1987, NBC Productions provided funding for a feature film that starred Cassandra Peterson as her Elvira character, which raised 5–6 million by NBC to fund the film. In 1988, NBC started a deal with Peter Engel that resulted in the creation of Good Morning, Miss Bliss and eventually producing a number of teen shows.In early 1990, NBC had struck a development deal with musician/producer Quincy Jones and his Quincy Jones Entertainment company. Also the same year, NBC inked a deal with Jay Tarses for his production company. By 1990, NBC returned to producing hit programs with the sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel Air, which starred Will Smith, in one of the first TV roles. Also that same year, NBC Productions partnered with Group W Productions to develop a syndicated program House Party. In 1991, NBC produced another syndicated show, this time, out of the WMAQ-TV studios, Johnny B...On the Loose, in partnership with Viacom Enterprises.In 1993, Perry Simon left NBC to start his own production company with a non-exclusive production agreement. In 1995, NBC launched a partnership with television director James Burrows to create 3 Sisters Entertainment, who produced series for the network. Out of these five, the most successful out of the venture were WillGrace and Caroline in the City (co-produced and owned by CBS Productions). Later that year, NBC Productions was however folded into NBC's entertainment division.In 1996, the company was renamed NBC Studios. The company had returned to producing hit programs like The Pretender, Profiler, Providence, Ed, Las Vegas and Crossing Jordan. In 2004, NBC Studios was merged with Universal Network Television to form NBC Universal Television Studios.Universal Television (original iteration) The first incarnation of Universal Television was reincorporated from Revue Productions in 1964, 2 years after MCA Inc. bought Universal Pictures and its then-current parent Decca Records. Among their many contributions to television programming included production of the first television film (See How They Run from 1964), the first wheel series (The Name of the Game from 1968), the first rotating series with an umbrella title (1969's The Bold Ones) and the first two-part television movie (Vanished from 1971). Uni TV (also commonly known as MCA/Universal) also co-produced many shows with Jack Webb's Mark VII Limited such as Emergency!, Adam-12 and a revival of the 1951 series Dragnet. During the 1970s and 1980s, Uni TV produced shows such as Baretta, The Rockford Files, Murder, She Wrote, Miami Vice, The Equalizer, The Incredible Hulk, Battlestar Galactica, Buck Rogers in the 25th Century, Knight Rider, The A-Team, SimonSimon and Magnum, P.I., which received critical acclaim and several TV movie spin-offs after their cancellations.In 1967, Grant Tinker, formerly employee of NBC was hired to join the studio. He held the position for two years, until he left in 1969 to join 20th Century-Fox Television, and later that year, had to start MTM Enterprises. He subsequently left Fox in 1971 due to conflicts with running MTM.In 1980, Bud Austin has received a production contract with Universal Television to produce television series. One of the more notable and legendary contracts was writer/producer Dick Wolf, whose Universal association began in 1986 with Miami Vice, then writing for several more shows before creating the hit LawOrder franchise. In 1987, Universal Television, which by then, was the leading producers in prime time television programming, decided to have six pilots committed for network production value, plus three series for the 1987–88 season, which included development deals with people who already contracted with Universal.In 1990, MCA/Uni TV began the LawOrder franchise. In 1991, Tom Thayer was named president of the Universal Television arm. In 1993, former Warner Bros. Television senior vice president of production employee Steven J. Papazian joined Universal Television as vice president of production. In 1992, Universal Television inked a deal with several newer talent, plus some returning and existing talent that were offered at the studio, including Ivan Reitman, David Burke, John Leekley and R.J. Stewart. In 1993, St. Clare Entertainment, a company owned by John Landis had reupped its contract at both MCA TV, MTE and Universal Television, three of the encompassing TV units of MCA via the MCA TV Group. In 1994, Universal Television made a financing partnership with ABC to help them fund the show Blue Skies.In 1996, MCA was reincorporated as Universal Studios. Around the same time, Universal was acquired by Joseph A. Seagram and Sons and later acquired the Multimedia Entertainment and USA Network. Also that year, Universal Television collaborated with Warner Bros. Television to develop the series Spy Game for ABC, with Universal alumnus Sam Raimi and Robert Tapert of Renaissance Pictures, and Warner alumnus John McNamara producing the series, but it didn't last long, as it only lasted one season on the air.Universal purchased a 50", "machine_text": "Universal Television is an American television production studio established in 1948.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Fungal genome\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Fungal genomes are among the smallest genomes of eukaryotes. The sizes of fungal genomes range from less than 10 Mbp to hundreds of Mbp. The average genome size is approximately 37 Mbp in Ascomycota, 47 Mbp in Basidiomycota and 75 Mbp in Oomycota. The sizes and gene numbers of the smallest genomes of free-living fungi such as those of Wallemia ichthyophaga, Wallemia mellicola or Malassezia restricta are comparable to bacterial genomes. The genome of the extensively researched yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains approximately 12 Mbp and was the first completely sequenced eukaryotic genome. Due to their compact size fungal genomes can be sequenced with less resources than most other eukaryotic genomes and are thus important models for research. Some fungi exist as stable haploid, diploid, or polyploid cells, others change ploidy in response to environmental conditions and aneuploidy is also observed in novel environments or during periods of stress.Genome comparisonsThe comparison of fungal genomes has been used to study the evolution of fungi, to improve the resolution of the phylogeny of fungal species, and to determine the time of the emergence and changes in species traits and lifestyles, such as the evolution symbiotic or pathogenic interactions, and the evolution of different morphologies. Major chromosomal rearrangements in fungi were found to be more frequent than in other eukaryotes, thus macrosynteny in fungi is rare. However, in filamentous ascomycetes genes were found to be conserved within homologous chromosomes, but with randomized orders and orientations, a phenomenon named mesosynteny. Mesosynteny was also observed in the basidiomycetous genus Rhodotorula. A comparison of more than 1000 Saccharomyces cerevisiae genomes was used to identify the geographical origin and several domestication events of the species as well as map genomic variants to the species-wide phenotypic landscape of the yeast. Comparisons of several genomes of the same species led to discovery of high levels of recombination in species that were previously considered asexual. In the extremely halotolerant black yeast Hortaea werneckii it was discovered that while the species is clonal, both haploid and diploid strains can be found in nature and the diploid strains are highly heterozygous hybrids, which appear to be stable over large time scales and geographical distances.Use in taxonomyWhile genomic distance measures such as the average nucleotide identity (ANI) are used routinely to distinguish bacterial species, the use of fungal genomes in taxonomy is currently rare. Genome sequences can be used to expand the number of genes used in phylogenetic analyses, but many publicly available genomes lack gene annotations and popular rDNA markers are typically missing from genomic sequences or are incorrectly assembled. Suggested measures of overall genome related indices in yeast include ANI, digital DNA-DNA hybridisation (dDDH) and Kr distance. Genomic collinearity was suggested as a possible source of markers to resolve species complexes. Pairwise Kr genomic distances and average nucleotide identity were used in the description of new species within the genera Aureobasidium and Tilletia. Alternatively, quick and simple to calculate similarity measures based on MinHash also appear to produce usefully accurate estimates of distance between genomes. For example, a fixed threshold genomic distance calculated tools such as Mash and Dashing was able to determine whether two genomes belong to the same or to different species with over 90", "machine_text": "Fungal genome refers to the complete set of DNA sequences present in the genome of fungi. The fungal genome is similar to that of other eukaryotic organisms but has several unique features, including high levels of gene duplication, genomic plasticity, and accelerated rates of evolution. Genome sequencing of fungi has become increasingly common in recent years, and a large number of fungal genomes have been sequenced and annotated. These genome sequences provide valuable insights into the genetic basis of fungal biology, including gene regulation, pathogenesis, and adaptation to different environments. One of the most unique features of the fungal genome is the presence of repetitive elements, which constitute a significant proportion of the genome. These repetitive elements often play a role in the evolution of new genes and functions by providing a substrate for homologous recombination and gene duplication. Another important feature of the fungal genome is the presence of secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters, which are responsible for the production of a diverse array of bioactive compounds. These compounds are of significant interest for their medicinal properties, and the identification and characterization of these gene clusters has become a major focus of fungal genomics research. Fungal genomics has also provided important insights into the evolution of fungal pathogens, including the mechanisms that allow fungi to evade host immune responses and the development of drug resistance. Additionally, comparative genomics studies have revealed the evolutionary relationships between different fungal species and shed light on the mechanisms of speciation and adaptation in these organisms. Despite the significant progress that has been made in fungal genomics in recent years, many aspects of fungal biology and genetics remain poorly understood. However, continued advances in sequencing technologies and bioinformatics tools are likely to lead to further breakthroughs in our understanding of the fungal genome and its role in fungal biology and evolution.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 65758285}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Bengalia\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Bengalia is a genus of blow flies in the family Calliphoridae with one authority considering the genus to belong to a separate family Bengaliidae. These bristly and, unlike the greens and blues of most calliphorids, dull coloured flies, are especially noted for their relationship to ants. Little is known of their biology and life-cycle, although adults of many species are kleptoparasitic on ants and will snatch food and pupae being carried by ants or feed on winged termites. The apt name “Highwayman Fly” was given by an early observer of their way of robbing ants. Very little is known about their breeding habits. The genus is found in the Afrotropical and oriental region with one species from Australia possibly a recent introduction.Description Most of the species have a yellow or brown ground-colour, an antero-posteriorly compressed head, stout mouthparts, a projecting clypeus below the lower facial margin, and have a silent flight.Behaviour Bengalia flies are best known for their remarkable highwayman-like habit of robbing ant pupae from ants moving on ant roads. With respect to Bengalia depressa this habit is described as follows: “[The flies were] settling on blades of grass, stones, and other raised objects near the ant column. ... When any ant made a little circuit away from the main body, a fly would generally pursue it at a distance of about half an inch, but back away as soon as the ant turned towards it. ... Eventually Lamborn saw a fly stalk a minor ant carrying a pupa in its jaws. Suddenly the fly rushed forward and apparently pierced the pupa bringing the ant up with a sharp jerk. The two insects then had a tug of war with very little advantage to either side, until the ant apparently became annoyed and letting go of the pupa rushed at the fly, which escaped with the booty which it proceeded to suck. Then he saw a fly swoop down on the ant column and rise at once with a pupa and attendant ant, both of which it dropped after carrying them for about a foot. The ant, however, still held on and started to run off with its charge. The fly caught it again and this time rose three feet in the air and then dropped ant and pupa again. This time the ant left the pupa which the fly immediately seized and proceeded to suck.”SpeciesBengalia africana Malloch, 1927 Bengalia africanoides Rognes Bengalia akamanga (Lehrer) Bengalia aliena Malloch, 1927 Bengalia asymmetria KurahashiTumrasvin, 1979 Bengalia bantuphalla (Lehrer) Bengalia bezzii Senior-White, 1923 Bengalia calilungae Rueda, 1985 Bengalia chekiangensis Fan Bengalia chiangmaiensis KurahashiTumrasvin, 1979 Bengalia chromatella Séguy, 1946 Bengalia concava Malloch, 1927 Bengalia cuthbertsoni Zumpt, 1956Bengalia depressa Walker, 1858 Bengalia emarginata Malloch Bengalia emarginatoides Rognes Bengalia emdeniella (Lehrer) Bengalia escheri Bezzi, 1913 Bengalia fani FengWei Bengalia favillacea (Walker) Bengalia fernandiella Lehrer Bengalia floccosa Wulp Bengalia fuscipennis Bezzi, 1913 Bengalia gaillardi SourcoufGuyon, 1912 - Synonyms:B. spurca BrauerBergenstamm, 1891, B. spurca Villeneuve, 1914 Bengalia gigas Macquart Bengalia hastativentris Senior-White, 1923 Bengalia hobbyi Senior-White, 1940 Bengalia inermis Malloch, 1927 Bengalia jejuna Fabricius Bengalia kanoi KurahashiMagpayo, 2000 Bengalia kuyanianus Matsumura Bengalia labiata Robineau-Desvoidy, 1830 Bengalia lampunia Lehrer Bengalia lateralis Macquart Bengalia latro Meijere Bengalia lyneborgi James, 1966 Bengalia martinleakei Senior-White, 1930 Bengalia minor Malloch, 1927 Bengalia nirvanella Lehrer Bengalia pallidicoxa Senior-White, 1946 Bengalia peuhi Villeneuve, 1914 Bengalia pseudovaricolor KurahashiTumrasvin, 1979 Bengalia pygomalaya Lehrer Bengalia racovitzai (Lehrer) Bengalia recurva Malloch, 1927 Bengalia robertsi Kurahashi, 1987 Bengalia roubaudi Rickenbach, HamonMochet, 1960 Bengalia semerunia Lehrer Bengalia seniorwhitei (Lehrer) Bengalia siamensis Senior-White, 1924 Bengalia smarti (Lehrer) Bengalia spinifemorata Villeneuve, 1913 Bengalia subnitida James, 1964 Bengalia surcoufi Senior-White, 1923 Bengalia taiwanensis Fan, 1965 Bengalia taksina (Lehrer) Bengalia tibiaria Villeneuve, 1926 Bengalia torosa Wiedemann Bengalia unicolor Senior-White, 1946 Bengalia varicolor Fabricius, 1805 Bengalia wangariae (Lehrer) Bengalia weii Rognes Bengalia wyatti (Lehrer) Bengalia xanthopyga Senior-White, 1924 Bengalia zhangi (LehrerWei)Taxonomic dispute The genus was reclassified into 11 new genera in 4 subfamilies by Andy Lehrer in 2005, within a newly designated family, Bengaliidae. The family designation was disputed by Rognes (2006) who noted that it was equivalent to the already established tribe Bengaliini (now the subfamily Bengaliinae), and that treating it as a family renders the Calliphoridae paraphyletic.Further Rognes considers all the new genera created as junior names for Bengalia. Lehrer's work adds 49 species to the already described 41 species and 18 of these new species are treated as invalid by Rognes. At present, major sources of Dipteran taxonomy do not recognize Lehrer's 10 new genera as valid, nor the 18 new species treated as invalid by Rognes (e.g.). Additional names published by Lehrer have since been synonymized, with 120 new synonymies established in a single review in 2020.This dispute reflects that at present, there is no consensus as to the best way to subdivide the Calliphoridae, which many authorities acknowledge is not a natural group (in this case, polyphyletic); the BioSystematic Database of World Diptera, for example, states 'The Calliphoridae are marked as a polyphyletic group of convenience as at the present we are unwilling to reduce the Oestridae to a subordinated group within a monophyletic Calliphoridae nor to elevate a number of other groups (Polleniidae, Helicoboscidae, and Bengaliidae) so as to properly delimit both Calliphoridae and Oestridae.' Similarly, the dispute at the generic level is that some of Lehrer's genera are paraphyletic, and, additionally, that they are based largely or exclusively upon features of the male genitalia, and it is therefore impossible to identify most female specimens to subfamily, let alone genus (the rejection of Lehrer's subdivisions therefore being both taxonomic and a matter of practicality). The dispute at the species level centers on the fact that Lehrer did not include or examine 24 of the 41 known species in his revision, so of the 31 species he validly described that were not immediately synonymized, many could still potentially be synonyms of these 24 excluded species.ReferencesCalliphoridae Oestroidea genera Taxa named by Jean-Baptiste Robineau-Desvoidy", "machine_text": "Bengalia is a genus of small flowering plants in the family Fabaceae, native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. The plants are typically woody shrubs or climbers, with compound leaves and pea-like flowers in shades of red, pink, or purple. The genus was first described in 1837 by the British botanist John Lindley and is currently classified in the subfamily Caesalpinioideae. Bengalia species have a wide variety of uses in traditional medicine, as their bark, leaves, and roots contain a range of active compounds with anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and anticancer properties. In East Asia, the root of Bengalia striata is used in the treatment of liver and spleen disorders, as well as to improve blood circulation and ease menstrual pain. In Africa, the leaves of Bengalia subsessilis are used in a tea to treat malaria, while the bark of Bengalia senegalensis is used to alleviate toothache and rheumatic pain. Bengalia plants are also valued in horticulture for their attractive foliage and showy blooms. Bengalia gentryi, native to Ecuador and Colombia, is a popular species in cultivation for its bright red flowers and glossy green leaves. Bengalia racemifera, a native of Southeast Asia, is prized for its ornamental value as a climbing vine that can reach up to 15 meters in height. Several Bengalia species are also used as an ornamental plant in traditional Chinese gardens. The taxonomy of Bengalia is complex, with many species having undergone multiple name changes and reclassifications over the years. As of 2021, the genus contains around 50 recognized species, though further taxonomic research is needed to fully clarify its phylogeny and distribution. Despite this, Bengalia plants remain an important cultural and ecological resource in many parts of the world, and are an intriguing subject for both scientific and aesthetic study.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 8887164}

It is the largest fishing port in the country and on the island of Ireland. It is located on the south coast of the county, north of Donegal Bay, near Donegal Town. Its Irish name Na Cealla Beaga means 'little cells', a reference to early monastic settlements. The town is situated at the head of a scenic harbour and at the base of a vast mountainous tract extending northward. In the summer, there is a street festival celebrating the fish catches and incorporating the traditional 'Blessing of the Boats'. , the population was 1,236.HistoryIn 1588, Killybegs was the last port of call for the Spanish vessel La Girona, which had dropped anchor in the harbour when the Spanish Armada fetched up on the Irish coast during Spain's war with England. With the assistance of a Killybegs chieftain, MacSweeney Bannagh, the Girona's personnel were fed, her rudder repaired, and she set sail for Scotland, but was wrecked off the Antrim coast with the loss of nearly 1,300 lives.The railway line opened on 18 October 1893 on the Donegal Railway Company line from Donegal to Killybegs railway station.The Donegal Town to Killybegs branch of the County Donegal Railway terminated at the harbour and some of the remains can still be seen to this day. The railway was closed on 1 January 1960.Fishing industryKillybegs is a natural deepwater harbour with a depth of 12 metres at low water spring tide at the new €50 million pier completed in 2004. The harbour is home to all the largest Irish midwater pelagic trawlers and a modest whitefish fleet, but it handles many other types of shipping as well. These include passenger cruise liners and mixed specialist cargoes. In recent years Killybegs has become the favoured port for the importation of wind turbines and is a service port for the offshore gas/oil drilling rigs.The town is the centre of the Irish pelagic fishing and processing industries, as it specialises in the processing and freezing of species such as mackerel, herring, scad, and blue whiting.The finished processed fish is exported to markets in Africa, the Middle East and Europe by freezer ships. However, due to blanket enforcement of EU fishing regulations on Irish vessels by the Irish Department of the Marine, starting in 2005, and mackerel shoals remaining longer in Norwegian waters, there has been a downturn in the fishing industry in the town.This has led to redundancies in the fish processing industry, in which the fish factory workers have been the hardest hit.EducationThe first national school, known as 'Killybegs National School', and later as the 'Commons National School', opened in 1834 on a site originally provided by the Plantation Commissioners in the reign of King James I There are three national schools and one second-level school in Killybegs as well as a third level institution Tourism College Killybegs, the only dedicated tourism institute in Ireland, offering courses in hospitality and culinary skills.

At first the church was to be named Tempio della Pace, to remember and honour the fallen of World War I. Construction began in May 1920. The original design proposed by Marcello Piacentini was inspired by the churches built in Rome in the 16th century.Construction halted with the death of Ottavio Gasparri, in 1929. In the next two years Piacentini changed radically the project, being inspired by the emerging Rationalist movement, and the Sacro Cuore di Gesù marked the turning point of the sacred architecture in Rome. The construction started again in 1931 and the church was inaugurated in 1934.The church became a parish church under Pope Pius XI on 31 October 1926 with the apostolic constitution Regis pacifici. On 5 February 1965 was declared titular church by Pope Paul VI with the apostolic constitution Sacrum Cardinalium Collegium. Later that year, with the motu proprio Recentioris architecturae the church became a minor basilica.DesignThe church has a brick façade with alternate courses raised and recessed; the façade is capped with travertine and the doors and windows are framed with the same material. The floor plan, with a central nave of approximately 70 metres in length and flanked by two aisles, is a hybrid of a Latin cross and a Greek cross. The hemispherical dome is 36 metres high and 20 metres in diameter. Over the main portal there is a high relief by Arturo Martini depicting the sacred heart of Jesus.

This storm followed Typhoon Hato which affected the area a few days prior. Pakhar was the fourteenth named storm of the Pacific typhoon season. Pakhar developed from a tropical depression to the east of Luzon during August 24, and intensified into a tropical storm later that day. Pakhar made landfall over in Aurora on August 25. Pakhar gradually intensified and peaked as a severe tropical storm by August 27, making landfall over Taishan, Jiangmen in Southern China.Meteorological historyOn August 23, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started to monitor a tropical disturbance that had developed about 895 km (556 mi) to the north of the island of Palau. The next day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a weak tropical depression, while the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA). Six hours after the TCFA, the JMA began issuing advisories on the depression after they have determined that the system contained winds of 55 km/h (35 mph). By 15:00 UTC of the same day, the JTWC had upgraded the system to a tropical depression, assigning the numerical designation 16W. Three hours later, the JMA tracked that 16W had already strengthened into a tropical storm, giving 16W the name Pakhar. Around the same time, the PAGASA began issuing advisories under the local name Jolina. After it was depicted by satellite imagery that there were deep convection obscuring its low-level circulation center (LLCC), the JTWC had upgraded the system to a tropical storm.By August 25, Pakhar slightly intensified after convective banding wrapping to its LLCC was depicted by imagery. Pakhar was also located in a very favorable environment such as low wind shear along with warm sea-surface temperatures of 31 °C (87.8 °F). Pakhar slightly intensified after a burst of deep convection developed just prior of making landfall over in Luzon in the province of Aurora. However, due to land reaction from the archipelago and the inclusion of a weakened convective structure, Pakhar weakened to minimal tropical storm intensity.After emerging to the South China Sea on August 26, Pakhar began to re-intensify as the storm entered in an area of a much lower amount of wind shear. However six hours later, Pakhar maintained its intensity after its LLCC became exposed and its deep convective banding became fragmented. By 18:00 UTC of the same day, the JMA upgraded Pakhar's intensity as a severe tropical storm, despite its central convection remaining disorganized. The PAGASA also stated that the storm had already exited their area of responsibility, issuing its final bulletin on Pakhar. By 00:00 UTC of August 27, Pakhar reached its maximum intensity of 100 km/h (65 mph) with a minimum barometric pressure of 985 hPa while making landfall over in South China in the city of Taishan. The JTWC assessed Pakhar's maximum intensity slightly higher with winds of 110 km/h (70 mph), however. Three hours later, the JTWC issued their final advisory. By 06:00 UTC, Pakhar began to rapidly weaken as the JMA downgraded Pakhar to a tropical storm. The JMA tracked the system until 18:00 UTC of the same day when it fully dissipated.Preparations and impactPhilippinesTropical Storm Pakhar was locally named as Jolina within the country by PAGASA. As soon as the PAGASA began issuing advisories on the storm, Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal#1 was raised over most of Cagayan Valley and northern Aurora during August 24. Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal #2 was also raised in the same areas with the inclusion of the Cordillera Administrative Region while Signal #1 was extended to the Ilocos Region and Bicol Region. By August 25, a total of 16 provinces were placed in a warning as they were located within aradius of the storm. Classes were suspended for all levels over in Albay, Bicol due to possible threats of flooding and landslides on August 25. The government also announced the suspension of classes for August 26 over in Metro Manila and some parts of Central Luzon and Calabarzon. The province of Ilocos Sur declared the suspension of work in all public and private services that same day.The Office of the Civil Defense warned residents of low-lying areas in the provinces of Cagayan and Isabela of potential flooding. Kennon Road in Benguet were closed due to the threat of landslides. Hiking, trekking, and caving were suspended over in mountainous areas in the Mountain Province. Heavy rainfall from Pakhar caused the Magat Dam to overflow, which also submerged several bridges over in Isabela. A total of 11 flights to Hong Kong and South China from Ninoy Aquino International Airport were canceled due to the storm. Eight domestic flights were canceled throughout August 25.According to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council, 3,397 people were affected by the storm with 17 reports of flooding. The cities of Balatan, San Fernando and Ifugao suffered power outages throughout the storm. Overall, no casualties have been reported and damages were relatively minor. Recorded damages in Aurora province have reached PH₱41.27 million (US808 thousand).Hong Kong, Macau and South China Still recovering from the aftermath of Typhoon Hato which impacted the area four days earlier, the Macao Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau issued a Tropical cyclone signal No. 8 for Macau late on August 26, as the storm approached. An orange typhoon warning was also raised over in the provinces of Shenzhen and Guangzhou while red warning was raised in Zhuhai.

He briefly attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, but did not earn a degree.In 1812, Owen was elected to the North Carolina House of Commons and served there for two years; he was later elected to one year in the North Carolina Senate (1819–1820). Named to the North Carolina Council of State in 1824, Owen returned to the state senate in 1827 but was elected Governor by the General Assembly in December 1828, narrowly defeating Richard Dobbs Spaight, Jr. in a vote of 96 to 92.Owen served two consecutive one-year terms as governor, during which he promoted education and served concurrently as President of the University of North Carolina Board of Trustees. He was nominated for a third term as governor, but declined the nomination; that same year, he lost by one vote (to Willie Mangum) a bid to represent North Carolina in the United States Senate.In 1835, Owen was a prominent member of the North Carolina Constitutional Convention; there, he supported enfranchisement of land-owning Negro citizens and opposed religious tests for officeholders.Although during his earlier political life, Owen affiliated himself with the Democratic Party of Andrew Jackson, in 1839, he presided over the first state convention of the emerging Whig Party; three weeks later, he served as president of the National Whig Convention in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Owen was offered the vice-presidential position on the Whig presidential ticket of William Henry Harrison; he turned down the nomination. Had he accepted, Owen might have become President of the United States following Harrison's death early in office instead of John Tyler.Owen retired to his farm in Chatham County, North Carolina, where he died on October 9, 1841 (Raleigh Register and North-Carolina Gazette, Raleigh, NC, October 19, 1841, page 3, column 5); he is buried in the churchyard of St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church in Pittsboro, North Carolina.Sources1787 births 1841 deaths American people of Welsh descent Governors of North Carolina People from Bladen County, North Carolina North Carolina Democrats North Carolina state senators Democratic Party state governors of the United States North Carolina Whigs 19th-century American politicians", "machine_text": "John Owen (North Carolina politician) was an American politician and lawyer who served as the 45th Governor of North Carolina from 1828 to 1830.

He received his education from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and later studied law under John Louis Taylor in New Bern, North Carolina. Owen began his political career by serving as a member of the North Carolina House of Commons from 1811 to 1813. He then served as a member of the North Carolina Senate from 1814 to 1815 and again from 1817 to 1818. In 1820, he was elected to the United States House of Representatives, where he served until 1829. In 1828, Owen was elected Governor of North Carolina, defeating his opponent Charles Fisher by a small margin. During his tenure as governor, Owen focused on improving the state's infrastructure, including the construction of new roads and canals. He also advocated for the establishment of a state-funded public school system. Despite his early popularity, Owen's governorship was marked by controversy. He clashed with the state's Whig-controlled legislature and was accused of using his position to reward his political allies. His re-election bid in 1830 was unsuccessful, and he was succeeded by David L. Swain. After leaving office, Owen continued to practice law and remained active in politics.

The line currently runs from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in Woodlawn to Middle River, both in Baltimore County, Maryland (on opposite sides) with selected trips terminating at Downtown Baltimore City Hall, passing through the west and east sides and the downtown area of Baltimore City. Service operates every 12 minutes during rush hour, and every 15 minutes at most other times during its hours of operation. The line serves the corridors of Edmondson Avenue in West Baltimore, including the communities of Edmondson Village, Allendale, and Rosemont, and Fayette Street and Eastern Avenue in East Baltimore, serving Patterson Park, Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center and Essex.Unlike a local bus, the 40 does not stop at every bus stop along its route. Rather, its stops are limited to certain locations of importance, including transfer points to other bus lines, major landmarks, and other busy intersections selected by MTA. In all, there are 32 stops along the route in each direction, which are all identified in printed timetables.History The Route 40 started operating on October 23, 2005 as part of the Greater Baltimore Bus Initiative, a plan of then-governor Robert L. Ehrlich for streamlining and simplifying the Baltimore transit system. Unlike a rail line, this addition did not require any construction. The bus route was intended to resemble the proposed Red Line that is currently being studied for the Baltimore region.When it started operating, Route 40 ran from Security Square Mall to the Essex Park-and-Ride lot on Eastern Avenue. Weekday service operated every 10 minutes during rush hour and midday. On February 5 the following year, it was extended to Middle River and reduced to one bus every 12–15 minutes.On June 10, 2007, the eastern layover was moved to a safer location at Old Eastern and Vincent Avenues. The western layover was moved to CMS on February 8, 2009 and the stop at Security Square Mall was moved from the parking lot of the mall to a point along Security Boulevard adjacent to the mall lot.Quickbus 40 PLUS Service Enhanced service for West Baltimore residents on the QuickBus 40 will begin October 25th, 2015.The enhanced service will increase frequency and reliability on the line between the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid in Baltimore County and City Hall in Baltimore City.Customer will find additional bus trips added on west side between CMS and City Hall to enhance off-peak and weekend access to jobs.CriticismRoute 40 received a lot of criticism following its inauguration from riders, politicians, and the media. This criticism resulted in some changes being made to the route, schedule, and other details.The service, which was projected to have a daily ridership level of 27,000, fell far short of that goal. Many riders waiting for other buses at common stops complained about seeing a lot of empty Route 40 buses. This resulted in its weekday frequency being reduced.Low ridership and unrealistic time allocation initially being built into the schedule resulted in poor on-time performance and buses clumping together. As one bus fell behind schedule while busy picking up passengers, the one behind it got ahead after stops had been cleared of waiting passengers, and ultimately caught up to the earlier bus. This left larger gaps between buses.Financial resources needed in order to operate this service were obtained by cutting back on the amount of local bus service along common streets of operation, mostly on Route 23, which had its level of service cut by nearly 50", "machine_text": "Route 40 is a bus route operated by the Maryland Transit Administration (MTA) servicing the Baltimore metropolitan area. The route was first established in 1975 and runs primarily along the Baltimore National Pike, commonly known as Route 40, spanning from the city of Baltimore to the western suburb of Ellicott City. Route 40 offers convenient transportation for commuters, students, and travelers alike, with multiple stops along the way which include shopping centers, medical facilities, and schools. The bus route is also a major transportation connection between various MTA bus, metro, and light rail systems. The route operates seven days a week, with a frequency of approximately every 15 to 20 minutes during peak hours and every hour during off-peak hours. The service starts from early morning and runs through midnight. Major stops on the westbound and eastbound routes include Edmondson Avenue, Catonsville, Woodlawn, Security Square Mall, Rolling Road, and Ellicott City. In addition to regular service, Route 40 also provides limited stop service during weekday peak hours between the Social Security Administration, CCBC Catonsville, and UMBC. The limited-stop service provides faster and more direct service for these major educational and employment centers along the route. The MTA has made concerted efforts to improve the Route 40 service over the years, upgrading the fleet with more environmentally friendly and accessible vehicles. The agency has also implemented technological improvements such as real-time bus tracker applications and automated passenger counters to enhance passenger experience.

Caps range fromin diameter. The flesh is thin and white, with a mild taste and without a strong smell. Stems are cylindrical, white in color, often curved or bent, and aboutlong andin diameter. The gills are white, closely spaced, and run down the stem. The spores of the golden oyster mushroom are cylindrical or elliptical in shape, smooth, hyaline, amyloid, and measure 6-9 by 2–3.5 micrometres.Ecology The golden oyster mushroom, like other species of oyster mushroom, is a wood-decay fungus.In the wild, P. citrinopileatus most commonly decays hardwoods such as elm.Spores are spread by the beetle Callipogon relictus. The first official sightings of naturalized golden oysters in the United States appeared around 2012, perhaps a decade after the cultivation of the species began in North America, and they have been found growing on oak, elm, beech, and other hardwoods. Naturalized golden oysters have been found in many states including: Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Their vigorous range expansion is comparable to invasive species. Wild samples and two of the commercial isolates examined showed very high genetic similarity, alluding to potential source strains of wild populations.Uses Golden oyster mushrooms are cultivated commercially, usually on a medium of grain, straw, or sawdust.Pleurotus species are some of the most commonly cultivated mushrooms, particularly in China, due to their ease of cultivation and their ability to convert 100 g of organic refuse into 50-70 g of fresh mushrooms.ChemistryPleurotus citrinopileatus mushrooms are a source of antioxidants.Extracts from P. citrinopileatus have been studied for their antihyperglycemic properties, decreasing blood sugar levels in diabetic rats.They have also been studied as a source of lipid-lowering drugs; P. ostreatus, a related oyster mushroom, has been found to contain the cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin.In one study, among 11 other commonly cultivated or foraged mushroom species, Pleurotus citrinopileatus contained the second highest amount of the antioxidant and amino acid ergothionine at 3.94mg per gramm of dry weight, and fourth highest in glutathione at 1.39mg per gramm of dry weight.

It was discovered on 18 December 1992, by Belgian astronomer Eric Elst at CERGA in Caussols (), southeastern France. The asteroid was named after the Swedish city of Gothenburg (Göteborg).Orbit and classificationGöteborg is a member of the Eos family, an orbital group of more than 4,000 asteroids, which are well known for mostly being of stony composition with a relatively high albedo. It orbits the Sun in the outer main-belt at a distance of 2.8–3.2 AU once every 5 years and 2 months (1,892 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.06 and an inclination of 11° with respect to the ecliptic.The body's observation arc begins 61 years prior to its official discovery observation, with a precovery taken the night before its first identification asat Lowell Observatory in January 1931.Physical characteristicsSlow rotatorIn September 2012, photometric observations of Göteborg at the Palomar Transient Factory, California, rendered a rotational lightcurve with a period ofhours, or 14 days, and a brightness variation of 0.70 magnitude (). This makes a slow rotator, as most asteroids of this size typically have much shorter rotation periods.Diameter and albedoAccording to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Göteborg measures 15.491 and 15.689 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.084 and 0.1169, respectively The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.14, taken from 221 Eos, the family's largest member and namesake – and calculates a diameter of 11.53 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 12.44.NamingThis minor planet was named after Gothenburg (Göteborg), Sweden's second-largest city and the largest port in the Nordic countries, located on the country's southwest coast. Founded in the early 17th century and heavily influenced by the Dutch, the city still has its typical canal system.

She was the only child of Agnes de Lima, a writer on education, and Andrew Lang. She grew up in New York City, Mexico, and Palo Alto, California. She received her B. A. from Barnard College in 1942 and her M. S. in Journalism from Columbia University in 1944. After college, she worked for the United Press and as a freelance journalist until she began writing fiction full-time in 1948, studying in Hiram Hadyn's writer's workshop at the New School of Social Research.Her first novel, The Captain's Beach, was published by Charles Scribner's Sons in 1950, and told the story of the residents of a rooming house near New York City's waterfront. Although Nelson Algren called it, 'a very real achievement in tenderness, in understanding, and in earnestness,' the New Yorker's reviewer considered the writing 'painfully studied and even windy.' Looking back at the novel nearly 50 years later, in her obituary in the Independent, Christopher Hawtree described it as 'the work of somebody who, simultaneously, can write and yet can't.'Her second novel, The Swift Cloud (Scribners, 1952), was about a man falsely accused of murdering his mentally retarded son. She was awarded the 1953 Prix de Rome fellowship in literature and studied at the American Academy in Rome, where she met and married Stephen Greene, an American artist. They returned to the U. S. in 1954.Carnival by the Sea (Scribners, 1954), was described in The New York Times as 'the moving story of a lovely lost Eurydice, wandering in the gaudy hell of a modern amusement park.' Doris Grumbach, reviewing the book for Commonweal, wrote that it 'is strong enough to use what it must and impress the whole with an originality and force of its own.'Praise a Fine Day (Random House, 1959) drew upon the experiences of de Lima and her husband in Rome. Told in the voice of a nameless American artist in his early thirties living in New York City, it recalls how he agreed to an arranged marriage with the stateless and pregnant Polish mistress of a wealthy Egyptian Jew to give American citizenship to their unborn child. Entering into the deception for purely financial reasons, he falls in love with the woman but ultimately finds himself abandoned and wondering whether anything he knew about the situation was true. The book received de Lima's best reviews. Edmund Fuller proclaimed her 'one of the most deft, accomplished stylists among our younger writers,' and Granville Hicks wrote that she had 'a delicate style that matches her insights.' In his Independent obituary, Christopher Hawtree called in a 'small masterpiece': 'the 150 pages take in all manner of manipulation, evil, passion and illicit congress: it could surely have been the basis for one of the era's great movies....'Her fifth novel, Oriane (Harcourt, BraceWorld, 1968) received few reviews and those were less than enthusiastic. The reception so disappointed de Lima that she gave up writing completely. 'It broke her heart,' said Greene.She died of a stroke in Nyack, New York, on 19 September 1999.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Snyder, New York\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Snyder (originally Snyderville) is a hamlet within the town of Amherst in Erie County, New York, United States that is part of the Buffalo – Niagara Falls metropolitan area.The hamlet was established in 1837. It was named for Michael Snyder, its first postmaster, who also operated a store at the corner of Harlem Road, which is also known as New York State Route 240, and Main Street, which is also known as New York State Route 5. The hamlet blossomed due to retail activity demand created along the Main Street transportation route between Buffalo and points to the east in the 19th and early 20th century.As of 2009, the hamlet had several commercial districts, including a modest business district along Main Street that includes the original town focal point at Main Street and Harlem Road, and several educational institutions.The educational institutions are both public and private and range from kindergarten through college.The Snyder community has above-average affluence and education compared to the Buffalo region.The hamlet also hosts two structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places that serve as architectural artifacts of the early residential developments in the hamlet.The traditional definition of the hamlet is the 'Snyder' postal service area, now merged into the 14226 zip code.However, using United States Census Bureau-based data, which does not necessarily align exactly with the old postal boundaries, the modern definition includes parts of the neighboring Eggertsville hamlet.HistoryIn 1804, Timothy Hopkins was the first settler in the area that would later become Snydervilleand subsequently Snyder.Hopkins married Nancy Kerr in Williamsville in the first marriage on record in Erie County.As newlyweds, they moved to a log cabin on a farm on the 4301 Main Street location of Amherst Central High School.The Schenck family moved to Amherst at the corner of Main Street and Harlem Road in 1821. Abraham Snyder arrived from Pennsylvania in 1823 and moved to a spacious frame house in the late 1830s. His son Michael rose to prominence. John Schenck, Michael Snyder's cousin, built the hamlet's first house and later built the first store in 1837, which was the year the hamlet was first established.In 1830, a stagecoach was established. It was the first regularly scheduled public means of transportation between Buffalo and Batavia, and sometimes Albany, and operated along Buffalo Road, which was later renamed Main Street. By the 1850s, the Amherst economy thrived on agriculture. Snyder also had a pottery and brick factory. Throughout the 19th Century Snyder evolved as a small scale business community catering to surrounding farmers and the stagecoach line along Main Street.In 1879, the hamlets of Amherst began receiving newspaper service from the Amherst Bee, which continues to exist as of the beginning of the 21st century as a weekly newspaper. L. F. Crout opened a hotel in 1883.In 1892, an electric trolley, which ran from Main Street and Bailey Avenue, also known as U.S. Route 62, into Williamsville, connected Amherst with the city of Buffalo's streetcar system.This made Amherst's various hamlets more accessible and desirable to the wealthier city residents who were interested in expanding their estates into the 'country'.This caused growth and development of the Main and Harlem area which served as the center of town for the new suburbs. In 1905, the Snyderville Fire burned 12 buildings in the Main Street/Harlem Road area, including blacksmith shops, barns, and other businesses critical to the Snyder economy as well as livestock and stores of grain. In the 1920s, the town of Amherst began to develop by converting farmland into subdivisions. Snyder residents began to live closer to each other in new subdivisions.GeographySnyder is located in the southern part of Amherst, which is located in Erie County.As a hamlet it has no formal boundaries, but was originally defined by the area served by its post office.The traditional boundaries of the hamlet are Getzville and Brantwood Road on the west, Sheridan Drive, also known as New York State Route 324, on the north, I-290, known as the Youngmann Expressway/I-90, known as New York State Thruway on the east, and the Cheektowaga town line along Wehrle Drive east of Harlem Road and then Winspear Avenue on the south.When defining the Snyder community market area using census data, the western boundary extends a little further to include parts of the hamlet of Eggertsville, which was built around the Main Street and Eggert Road intersection, with a western boundary from north to south of Millersport Highway, also known as New York State Route 263, Longmeadow Road, Westfield Road, Main Street, LeBrun Road, and Eggert Road.When defined this way, Snyder includes (using a Main Street and Harlem Road origin, starting with the northwest quadrant, and moving clockwise) census block groups 1–3 from census tract 94.01; census block groups 34 from census tract 94.02; census block groups 3–5 from census tract 95.02; and census block groups 1, 3–5 from census tract 95.01.The center of town at Main Street and Harlem is at an elevation of .The business district is located between Burroughs Drive to the east and Campus Drive to the west on Main Street.In this region, the Snyder Fire Department, the Eggertsville-Snyder Branch of the BuffaloErie County Public Library (4622 Main Street), the Amherst YMCA (4433 Main Street), and the Main Harlem Plaza as well as the former location of the United States Postal Service office for the 14226 zip code that includes Snyder and the neighboring hamlet of Eggertsville are located.The post office for the zip code was formerly located at Main Street and Chateau Terrace with a 25 Chateau Terrace address until May 1, 1990.Harlem road crosses through the business district and connects three of the hamlet's four commercial districts.Sheridan Harlem Plaza and adjacent commercial property are located at the north end of Harlem. Both Kensington Avenue and Wehrle Drive intersect the southern part of the Snyder portion of Harlem in a commercial region that extends into Cheektowaga.The Harlem–Kensington commercial district is historic.The fourth commercial district is located in the eastern edge of the hamlet at the intersection of Main Street and Kensington Avenue near the entrance to the Youngmann Expressway. The extended Snyder community has additional commercial areas along the highly commercial Sheridan Drive and on Millersport Highway.Transportation Snyder is bounded by I-290, and has two interchanges on the eastern edge of the hamlet with this interstate highway that are both less than afrom the Main and Harlem center of town.This provides direct access to the I-90 (The New York State Thruway) and continuing south on Harlem to the New York State Route 33 a little more than a mile from Snyder through Cheektowaga also provides access to the I-90.The community is also serviced by the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority (NFTA), which provides three different bus routes (30, 48, and 49) connecting directly to the light rail Buffalo Metro Rail along Main Street to the west.All three of these routes connect to various parts of Williamsville to the east and provide connections to Erie Community College (north campus), the Buffalo Niagara International Airport and Transit Road (New York State Route 78).The hamlet is also serviced by NFTA route 65 from downtown Buffalo along Kensington Avenue to Main Street and the service continues to northeast Erie County destinations.Historically, transportation through town has been active on Main Street.In 1836, the street became a Macadam toll road.OnApril 5, 1893, the trolley line opened for business between Main Street and Bailey Avenue and the east end of Williamsvilleto the east.It was later extended another 3 miles to Transit road.LandmarksThe hamlet has two National Register of Historic Places listings: Entranceways at Main Street at Lamarck Drive and Smallwood Drive and Entranceway at Main Street at Roycroft Boulevard.The former were built in 1926 and the latter in 1918.Both were added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 7, 2005.These stone wall entrances to residential developments are common throughout Eggertsville and Snyder along Main Street and serve to give residential developments the appearance of having entrances similar to the former grand estates that were previously common along Main Street in the area.Willard Genrich built the Lord Amherst Motor Hotel on Main Street near the I-290 interchange on Main Street to harmonize with the colonial architectural motif used by the local Main Street businesses.EconomySnyder is an affluent and well-educated community in Metropolitan Buffalo.The residential population consists mostly of large single family homes on individual lots.The 2000 United States Census average household income of 87,700 ( today) far exceeds the Buffalo regional average of 57,400 ().The Snyder population declined from 14,294 to 13,875 while the number of households increased from 5,469 to 5,574 between the 1990 United States Census and the 2000 United States Census.During the decade the number of children age 5–17 and adults age 35–54 grew significantly while the young adults age 18–34 and adults over the age of 55 declined sharply.The number of housing units grew from 5,662 to 5,739. 1990 housing was 82.5", "machine_text": "Snyder is a small hamlet located in the town of Amherst, in Erie County, New York, United States. Located just 10 miles outside of the city of Buffalo, Snyder is a residential area with a population of approximately 9,000 residents. History Snyder was named after John Snyder, a pioneer of the area who owned and ran a successful mill business in the early 19th century. Throughout the years, the hamlet grew and prospered, and became a modern-day suburban community. In the early 20th century, Snyder was largely an agricultural area, with farms and orchards lining its streets. However, in the post-World War II era, the economy shifted towards manufacturing, and many jobs moved to the Buffalo-Niagara region. As a result, Snyder became a popular spot for professionals working in the city who desired a quieter, more residential lifestyle. Today, Snyder is a thriving community with a mix of small businesses, shops, and restaurants. Despite its proximity to the city, Snyder has been able to maintain a distinct character and identity, making it a sought-after location for residents. Education Snyder is home to several schools, including Amherst Central School District, an award-winning system that serves over 3,000 students in grades K-12. The schools in the district have consistently ranked among the top in the state, making Amherst a desirable place for families with children to live.

Native to the high-altitude lakes and rivers of the Tibetan Plateau and surrounding areas, Schizopygopsis is notable for its adaptations to cold, oxygen-poor environments. Schizopygopsis species typically have elongated bodies, flattened heads, and small eyes, all adaptations for life in fast-moving, high-altitude waters. They are often found in rocky streambeds and can tolerate water temperatures as low as 0 degrees Celsius. Schizopygopsis species are also known for their ability to survive in water with low oxygen levels, which is rare among fish. Several species within the Schizopygopsis genus have been described by researchers. These include Schizopygopsis malacanthus, Schizopygopsis pylzovi, and Schizopygopsis younghusbandi. Most species are commercially valuable food fish, and several are considered endangered due to overfishing and habitat destruction. Schizopygopsis is closely related to another genus of cold-water adapted cyprinids, Platypharodon. Together, these two genera are known as the 'Tibetan loaches,' a reference to their elongated, snakelike bodies and bottom-dwelling habits. While Schizopygopsis is relatively obscure to the wider world, it holds an important place in the ecology and culture of the Tibetan Plateau.

It was the second most popular onsen area in Tottori Prefecture during the beginning of the Shōwa era.Hot spring type Tōgō Onsen is classified as a chloride and sulfate type hot spring, with a spring source temperature of 85 to 94 degrees Celsius.Tōgō Onsen’s hot spring waters can be found near Matsuzaki station. Here, there is a 300-meter deep cavity in the layer of granite bedrock. This cavity is filled in with conglomerate sedimentary rock, called the Oshikagawa pyroclastic layer, along with diluvium and alluvium layers on top of it. Tōgō Onsen’s water originates from the granite, Oshikagawa, and diluvium layers, and its heat source is thought to be waste heat from the granite layer.Description There is a large multipurpose health resort at the edge of Tōgō Lake. Nearby is Japan’s largest Chinese garden, Enchō-en. The main hot spring resort area is to the east, where several Japanese ryokan inns operated up until and during Shōwa period. Currently, only two establishments, Yōshōkan and the town-managed Suimeisō, are in operation. Hot spring water flows out of the central part of the lake, causing steam to hang over its surface.There are two ashiyu footbaths in the area, which are free for anyone to use. At Tōgō-Hawai Seaside Park, there is a hot water fountain that can be used to create boiled eggs, known as onsen tamago. The other footbath is at Lake Tōgō Lakeside Park, which also has a station for making onsen tamago. According to figures reported by the local government, Tōgō Onsen reached its peak number of visitors from the early to mid-1970’s, with more than 350,000 visitors per year. In contrast, most other hot spring areas within Tottori Prefecture reached their peak visitor count from the late 1980’s to 1993.History The existence of the hot spring was referenced in a document written in 1749. At the time, hot spring water was drawn out by bamboo tubes inserted into the bottom of the lake, in conjunction with bamboo gates. Other documents show that the residents of Kami-Asozu village in modern-day Yurihama received permission from the Tottori Domain to draw water from the hot spring in 1843; during the Ansei Period, the hot spring water was used to treat low back pain.The origins of Tōgō OnsenUse of the hot springs for bathing began in 1868, at the start of the Meiji Period; in 1872, a large bath tub was constructed on Ryūyu-tō Island, which was located on the lake. A wealthy local farmer created a well for drawing spring water on the western bank of Tōgō River, as well as a separate building called the Yōshōkan, and gave access to the villagers. In 1884, this building began operating as a ryokan business. With the opening of the San'in Main Line and Matsuzaki station at the end of the Meiji Period, the number of yearly visitors reached 10,000 and the name Tōgō Onsen was given to the area. Japanese novelist Naoya Shiga once visited the Yōshōkan, and he mentions it in his short story collection Tottori. The Yōshōkan is still operating today.The origins of Matsuzaki Onsen At the start of the Taishō period, other areas near Matsuzaki station experienced an increase in onsen excavation. Around this time, many books about travel such as Japanese novelist Katai Tayama’s Nihon Isshū(“A trip round Japan”) were being published, and public interest towards domestic travel was growing. Scientific surveys for onsen were also being conducted; this led to the discovery of a new hot spring source during the late Taishō period, located near Matsuzaki station in Tōgō River. As a result, many new inns were built. These inns became collectively known as “Matsuzaki Onsen”, and soon the names Tōgō Onsen and Matsuzaki Onsen began to appear in documents.Consolidation into Tōgō Onsen Soon after Matsuzaki Onsen was created, it was formed into an association with Tōgō Onsen. According to the Nihon onsen taikan (Japan Onsen Encyclopedia) published in 1939, the total number of yearly lodging guests to the association’s seven inns at the time was 62,000. This made it the second most-visited onsen district in Tottori Prefecture, following Misasa Onsen’s 80,000 guests per year to its 20 inns. During the Edo Period, the narrow lakeshore on the eastern bank of the Tōgō River was a strategically important location for military and transportation purposes, so there was a lodge there. During the Meiji Period, the area had grown to become Matsuzaki Village, and had its own local government. Similarly, Tōgō Onsen and the surrounding areas formed Tōgō Village. In 1951, Matsuzaki Village and Tōgō Village merged to become Tōgō-Matsuzaki Town; in 1953, this entity merged with surrounding villages to form Tōgō Town. After this, the names of the hot springs were consolidated into “Tōgō Onsen”.From the Meiji Period to the Shōwa Period, many famous people visited Tōgō Onsen, such as politicians Shigenobu Ōkuma, Shinpei Gotō, Yukio Ozaki, and Hiroshi Shimomura. Besides the aforementioned Katai Tayama and Naoya Shiga, writers such as Lafcadio Hearn, Shungetsu Ikuta, Rohan Kōda, and others have also visited.ReferencesExternal linksHawai- Tōgō Hot Spring and Ryokan AssociationTōgō Yu-asis RyūhōkakuHot springs of Japan Public baths in Japan Tourist attractions in Tottori Prefecture", "machine_text": "Tōgō Onsen is a hot spring resort located in the town of Tōgō, Aomori Prefecture, Japan.

Born in Bucharest, Eftimiu studied law and philosophy before pursuing a career in the arts. In 1912, he began working as a theater critic for the newspaper 'Adevărul', where he championed the modernization of Romanian theater, advocating for realistic and socially relevant plays. Eftimiu's most well-known play, 'The Cherry Orchard,' was first staged in 1914 and is considered a masterpiece of Romanian theater. The play is a satire of Romanian society, following the lives of a wealthy family as they struggle to adapt to the changing times. In addition to his work as a playwright, Eftimiu was also a respected stage director. He directed productions of Romanian classics such as 'Craii de Curtea-Veche' and 'Tache Ionescu,' as well as modern plays like Eugene O'Neill's 'Long Day's Journey Into Night.' In the 1940s, Eftimiu's career was interrupted by political turmoil. He was imprisoned by the communist regime for several years before being released in 1955. Despite the obstacles he faced, he continued to write and direct plays until his death in 1972. Today, Eftimiu is remembered as one of the most important figures in Romanian theater. His work helped to modernize and elevate the art form, inspiring generations of Romanian playwrights and directors who followed in his footsteps.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 65483287}

From the Secretary of State depends a single department, the General Secretariat for Immigration and Emigration, body that in other times has assumed the functions of the secretariat of state.History Since its inception and its worldwide expansion, Spain has always been a country that has received and sent large amounts of population. Most of the South American population and in a lesser amount the North American population, descends from Spanish ancestry.That has provoke that a common culture and language link dozens of countries of all the world, not just Latin American countries but also Asian countries like the Philippines, African countries like Morocco or Equatorial Guinea and North American countries like United States and Canada.It is not clear when migratory issues took center stage within the Spanish administration, although there is evidence that in 1882, a section was created inside the Ministry of Development destinated to these matters. Before this, there are documents that proves that the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of the Navy and the Ministry of Overseas were in charge of overseeing the migrations in the Peninsular Spain and in the Spanish territories in the Americas, Africa, Asia and Oceania and that there were also parliamentary committees to discuss migrations matters.In the 1920s, the Ministry of Labour assumed the competencies over immigration and emigration that still today maintains. During the dictatorship of Franco, in 1956, it was created the Spanish Institute for Emigration in order to control the emigration of the Spanish population, trying to direct it to countries with cultural links like South American's. This was done through collecting labor information abroad to offer Spaniards more attractive jobs in this type of countries.In 1985, the Institute was transformed into a Directorate-General being called Directorate-General of the Spanish Institute for Emigration. The name of this directorate was changed in 1991 to Directorate-General for Migration, a more accurate name because since 1985 this directorate had competences not only over emigration, but also over all kind of migrations.The Directorate-General change its name many times, in 1996 to Directorate-General for Labor and Migration and in 1998 Directorate General for the Regulation of Migrations.In 2004 was created the current Secretariat of State under the name of Secretariat of State of Immigration and Emigration and depending on it were three directorate-generals: Directorate-General for Immigration, Directorate-General for Emigration and Directorate-General for the Integration of Immigrants.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Reginald's Tower\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Reginald's Tower () is a historic tower in Waterford, Munster, Ireland. It is located at the eastern end of the city quay. The tower has been in usage for different purposes for many centuries and is an important landmark in Waterford and an important remnant of its medieval urban defence system. It is the oldest civic building in Ireland and it is the only urban monument in Ireland to retain a Norse or Viking name.Early historyReginald's Tower was built by the Anglo-Normans after their conquest of Waterford, replacing an earlier Viking fortification. The tower's name is derived from an Anglicised form of the Irish name Raghnall, which is in turn a Gaelicised form of the Old Norse Røgnvaldr. The tower's name seems to refer to one of the many Viking rulers of the town that bore the name. One possibility is that it refers to Ragnall Mac Gilla Muire, the last Hiberno-Norse ruler of the town. The present tower is likely to have been built in the 13th or 14th century; it may have been constructed between 1253 and 1280. In 1185 Prince John of England landed in Waterford and organised the rebuilding of the city's defences, including the tower.The tower is 54 feet high; its horizontal cross section is circular. It is 42½ feet in diameter and is surmounted by a conical roof. A spiral staircase ascends within the thick walls - these are 10 feet wide at the base, tapering down to 7 feet at the top. It was part of the ancient city walls of Waterford and could be considered the apex of a triangle formed by three structures — Turgesius Tower on Barronstrand Street, St. Martins Castle on Lady Lane, and Reginald’s Tower at the quay and the mall. It was strategically located on the high ground between a branch of St. John's River on the southeast (since drained, and now known as the Mall) and the River Suir to the north. It is also very close to the historic French Church. The site is sometimes called Dundory (an Irish word which means 'fort of oak'), and hence the tower is occasionally called the Dundory Tower. It is also known as the Ring Tower. It was one of seventeen towers which encircled the city of Waterford in medieval times. Today it is the largest of the six surviving towers, which are considered the finest examples of medieval urban defence in Ireland. The other surviving towers are the Watch Tower, Double Tower, French Tower, Semi-Lunar Tower and Beach Tower.Medieval historyThe tower has been used as a mint, a prison, and a military storehouse. It is also famous for being the location of the wedding of Richard de Clare, the second Earl of Pembroke, and Aoife (pronounced eefa), daughter of Dermot MacMurrough, King of Leinster. It occasionally served as a royal castle, and was visited by King John in 1210, who ordered new coins to be struck there. Richard II visited the tower in 1394 and again in 1399. He used the tower to store his munitions. On 27 July 1399 Richard left Reginald's Tower as King of England and Wales; on his arrival in England he was captured by the future Henry IV and forced to abdicate.In 1463, coins were minted in Reginald's Tower by order of the Irish Parliament, which, at that time, was meeting in the city. The coins had the words 'Civitas Waterford' struck on one side. In 1495, the tower’s cannons successfully deterred the forces of Perkin Warbeck, the pretender to the throne of Henry VII. Cannons from the tower sank one of his ships during an 11-day siege. This was the first successful use of artillery by an Irish city. A cannon from this ship was recovered from the River Suir in 1901. This victory earned the city its motto Urbs Intacta Manet - 'Waterford remains the unconquered city'.In 1649, Waterford was besieged by the army of the English parliamentarian Oliver Cromwell, but he failed to capture the city on that occasion. They returned in 1650, and this time they were successful. A cannonball, visible high up the wall on the north side of the building, is lodged firmly in the wall, and is reputed to be from this siege.In 1690, following his defeat at the Battle of the Boyne, James II of England is said to have climbed to the top of the tower to take a last look at his lost kingdom before embarking for exile in France.During the 17th and 18th centuries, the tower was used to store munitions. In the early 19th century it functioned as a prison.Present dayIn 1861, Reginald's Tower became the property of the Waterford Corporation, and the residence of the Chief Constable of Waterford. It continued to be inhabited until 1954, when the last resident left and the building was turned into a museum. During the Emergency it functioned as an air raid shelter. It currently houses the Waterford Viking Museum and exhibits many of the archaeological finds from the 2003 dig at Woodstown on the River Suir near the city.It is located in the area of Waterford Viking Triangle in the centre of Waterford city.

It was designed to defend the city from potential invasions and was given its name after Reginald, an Anglo-Norman knight who captured the city in the late 12th century. Throughout history, the tower has been used for various purposes. It served as a royal mint during the medieval period and as a prison during the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, it houses a museum that showcases the city's rich history and cultural heritage. The tower has undergone several renovations and restorations over the years. In the 19th century, it was restored by the Office of Public Works and used as a military barracks. In the mid-20th century, it was converted into a museum and underwent another major restoration in the 1980s. The tower stands at four stories tall and is made of local stone. It features narrow arrow slits and a vaulted ceiling on the first floor. The upper floors were added later and served as living quarters for the tower's defenders.

The initiative was launched by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in 2009, with the aim of promoting interdisciplinary collaborations between physical scientists and cancer biologists. There are currently twelve PS-OCs in the United States, located in prestigious universities such as MIT, Harvard, Stanford, and Caltech. Each center is led by a team of principal investigators from diverse fields, including physics, engineering, chemistry, and biology. The teams collaborate on a broad range of cancer-related research topics, such as cancer evolution, metastasis, drug resistance, and immunotherapy. The PS-OCs employ cutting-edge technologies and techniques to address these problems. For example, researchers at the MIT PS-OC developed a microfluidic device that mimics the human bloodstream, allowing them to study how cancer cells interact with blood components and evade immune surveillance. At the Harvard PS-OC, researchers are using nanoscale gold particles as contrast agents to enhance the sensitivity of tumor imaging with X-rays. One of the main goals of the PS-OCs is to develop new approaches for cancer diagnosis and treatment. To achieve this, the centers prioritize translational research that bridges the gap between basic science and clinical applications. Several PS-OCs have launched clinical trials to test their novel cancer therapies. For example, the Stanford PS-OC is testing a combination therapy that uses nanoparticles to deliver chemotherapy drugs and immunostimulatory molecules directly to tumors, while the Johns Hopkins PS-OC is testing a non-invasive imaging method that can detect early-stage ovarian cancer. In addition to their research activities, the PS-OCs also have a strong outreach and education component. They organize workshops, seminars, and summer schools to train the next generation of scientists in the interdisciplinary skills necessary to tackle complex biomedical problems. They also engage with the public through science festivals, social media, and public lectures, to raise awareness of the importance of physical sciences in cancer research. The PS-OCs have catalyzed a paradigm shift in cancer research, by bringing together scientists from different disciplines to collaborate on a common goal.

The show was hosted by a variety of personalities, including former Miss Australia Penny Spence, Terry Dear, Cornelia Frances, and Ernie Sigley. The series was a musical variety show that featured performances by local and international musicians, as well as comedy skits and interviews. Some of the most popular musical guests included The Bee Gees, Olivia Newton-John, and Sherbet. House Party was known for its high-quality production values, which were considered revolutionary for the time. The show's set featured a large stage with impressive lighting and sound equipment, and the program was broadcast in color, which was relatively new technology at the time. One of the show's most famous segments was 'The Sound of Musak', in which comedians John McKee and Mike McColl fronted a fictitious band that played cover versions of popular songs. This segment became one of the show's most beloved features and continued throughout the series run. House Party was a popular show with audiences and was one of the most-watched programs on Australian television during its run. Its popularity led to spin-off shows such as 'The Happy Half-Hour' and 'The Ernie Sigley Show,' and it paved the way for future music television programs in Australia. Despite its success, House Party eventually came to an end in 1979 due to declining ratings. However, its impact on Australian television and music culture cannot be overstated, and it remains a fondly remembered part of the country's entertainment history.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 41073989}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Tsui Po-ko\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Tsui Po-ko () (17 May 1970 – 17 March 2006) was a Police Constable of the Hong Kong Police Force, murderer and bank robber.He was killed during an ambush on two Police Constables in a Jordan subway which led to a shootout. The inquest into the events leading up to his death aroused great interest in Hong Kong, as it unravelled a string of intriguing events, and revealed the secret life of a policeman with a delusional state of mind. On 25 April 2007, the five-person jury in the coroner's court unanimously decided that Tsui was responsible for injuring one and killing two fellow police officers and a bank security guard, on three separate occasions.The jury returned a verdict that he had been 'lawfully killed' by fellow officer Tsang Kwok-hang in a shootout. The inquest lasted 36 days, one of the longest ever inquests in Hong Kong.Assistant Police Commissioner John Lee said that this was 'an exceptional case', while Coroner Michael Chan Pik-kiu called it 'the most difficult' inquest for a jury he had ever encountered.Biography Tsui was the elder of two children born in Shaowu, Fujian, and arrived in Hong Kong in 1978 with his mother. His father and brother arrived a year later. He attended the Kwun Tong Government Secondary Technical School (now Kwun Tong Kung Lok Government Secondary School). After graduation, he had several jobs, including a stint with the Royal Hong Kong Regiment.Tsui joined the Royal Hong Kong Police in 1993; he regarded it as a well paid job with good benefits, and was a police constable for 13 years until his death in 2006. He was an outstanding cadet at the Hong Kong Police College, having won the 'silver whistle'.Tsui was an excellent marksman, scoring full marks in target shooting and simulated bank robbery shooting in 1993. From 2001 to 2005, in the tests held three times a year, he scored a perfect 48 points.According to shooting range records, Tsui was a left-handed shooter but had also claimed that he was ambidextrous to a superior.From 1996 to 2001, Tsui made four attempts at the 'Police Constable/Senior Police Constable to Sergeant Promotion Qualifying Examination', He scored 68 marks in his 2000 attempt which earned him an interview, but his stubbornness and difficulty in communication meant that he was never promoted,and had given up applying for promotion by 1999. From then on until 2003, Tsui applied three times to join the Airport Security Unit, but failed in every attempt.He failed a personality assessment during the first attempt, and subsequently failed because of insufficient fitness.Between 2002 and 2005, he was attached to the Tsing Yi district.Tsui's wife, Lee Po-ling, worked at the Social Welfare Department as a social security assistant.The couple met when she worked as a sales assistant at the airport, and Tsui was also stationed there. They married in 1997 and had a daughter in 2000.In October 2001, Tsui and his wife appeared together in a couples version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? on ATV and won HK60,000 and stated that they would donate some of the money to charity.Tsui was an avid sportsman and Oxfam Trailwalker, and was known to participate in marathons and paragliding.Unbeknownst to his wife, he would also frequent massage parlours, karaoke bars, and prostitutes in Mong Kok and Shenzhen. Tsui was a habitual heavy gambler and was known to have made a HK75,000 wager on Japan to win the 2004 Asian Cup final at odds of 2.8:1 on 7 August 2004.Murder of Police Constable Leung Shing-yan Tsui was found responsible for murdering constable Leung Shing-yan () and stealing his revolver in March 2001. The 24-year-old Leung, who was engaged, had been on the force for five years.At 12:05 on 14 March 2001, the Lei Muk Shue Police Station received a regarding a noise complaint from a flat at Shek Wai Kok Estate. Leung responded to the call alone as his partner was still having lunch. His final radio call was received at 12:25 when he reported that he had arrived at the flat and nobody was responding to his knocks. He was subsequently attacked, struggling with his assailant to prevent his revolver being snatched, but was shot five times at close range. Leung took three bullets in the head and two in the back at Flat 552, Shek To House Block B. Under police guard, paramedics wearing bulletproof vests rushed Leung to Yan Chai Hospital where he was declared diseased upon arrival. His revolver, a fully loaded SmithWesson Model 10 4 Inch heavy barrel type revolver, a speedloader, loaded with six 'Calber 38Spl' bullets were missing.The noise complaint was likely bogus and was made from an burner phone. The police suspected that the officer was lured to the scene for his firearm. Heavily armed police locked down the building and mounted a search. Some 3,000 people, of which 2,000 were police officers, were interviewed by the police but the perpetrator escaped detection. Later, forensic tests found that the DNA on a mask left at the crime scene matched Tsui's.Leung is survived by his parents and a younger brother and sister. His wedding was scheduled to have been held in May.His funeral in Hung Hom was attended by top officials including Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa and Police Commissioner Tsang Yam-pui.Leung was buried at Gallant Garden. In 2002, he was posthumously awarded the Medal for Bravery (Silver) in recognition of his courage and 'gallantry of an extremely high order'.Bank robbery On 5 December 2001, Tsui carried out an armed bank robbery of the Hang Seng Bank branch at Belvedere Garden in Tsuen Wan.At 12:10, masked and alone, he burst into the bank. Security Guard Zafar Iqbal Khan, aged 31, struggled with the man. Khan was shot three times in the head, body and wrist. Khan cocked his Remington shotgun during the robbery after being shot twice, but did not manage to fire before his death. Tsui fled the bank with HK490,000 and US1,000,entering Castle Peak Road and then into the Belvedere Garden shopping arcade before escaping through another exit.Police entered the shopping arcade and launched a manhunt but failed to catch the suspect.The police located several domestic helpers who witnessed the robber removing his balaclava following the robbery and produced a facial composite image of the suspect.The perpetrator was described as a man with short hair and about 1.8 m tall, whom Assistant Police Commissioner Yam described as a 'calm, cold-blooded and brutal robber'.A HK2 million reward was issued. Immediately following the robbery the police noted that the murder weapon appeared to be a police service revolver. It was later discovered that Tsui matched the description of the perpetrator as captured on closed circuit television; key pieces of evidence were a red T-shirt, Mizuno brand shoes and the fact that footage showed the killer to be a left-handed gunman.He was placed near the scene by the police; Tsui boarded a bus from Yat Tung Estate in Tung Chung at 11:11 using a Octopus card issued to his wife; and boarded a minibus bound for Tsuen Wan at 11:53. A red T-shirt carrying a similar distinctive logo as captured on CCTV was found at Tsui's home after his death.The T-shirt, bearing the logo of the Yinchuan International Motor-cycle Travel Festival was a gift to Tsui by the club secretary during his visit to the show in 2000.An expert witness identified the T-shirt as having been worn inside-out during the robbery. Forensic ballistics later identified the gun used in the robbery as the police service revolver taken from police officer Leung Shing-yan in 2001.Zafar Iqbal Khan is survived by four children and wife, who lived in Pakistan at the time of his death. A ceremony attended by his relatives, friends and bank chairman Vincent Cheng was held at the Kowloon Masjid and Islamic Centre on 7 December before his body was returned to Pakistan later in the day. Khan was posthumously awarded the Medal for Bravery (Gold) for 'selfless bravery of the highest order', which was accepted on his behalf by his wife.Financial irregularities An investigation by the Criminal Intelligence Bureau into Tsui's financial status from January 2000 to March 2006 revealed he had a total of 19 personal banking and investment accounts hidden from his wife, the total assets of which amounted to a total of HK2,977,513. Seven personal and 12 investment accounts were opened under his name around mid-February in 2002 using a friend's address.Between February 2002 and October 2004, Tsui deposited HK557,718 into the 19 accounts.All transactions were in cash. It was reported that Tsui was active in foreign exchange market, commodities, securities, funds, and margin trading, and had lost a total of HK371,982 in those investments.Tsui and his wife bought one flat in August 1997 and paid HK574,800 in cash. Two years later, he bought a flat at Tung Chung Crescent with a HK396,173 down payment, paying monthly installments of HK17,778 for a first and a second mortgage.The mortgages were paid off in just five years, with HK388,151 in 2001 and HK500,000 in 2004.The police alleged that the transactions were inconsistent with a constable's salary and that the HK500,000 in unexplained cash would be consistent with the amount stolen during the heist in 2001.Ambush of Constable Sin Ka-keung and Constable Tsang Kwok-hangOn 17 March 2006, 28-year-old Constable Sin Ka-keung () and 33-year-old Constable Tsang Kwok-hang () were ambushed by Tsui while on patrol in the pedestrian subway connecting Austin Road and Canton Road. Constable Sin reported seeing Tsui lurking on the northern stairs of the subway and attempted to approach him. When the officers approached, Tsui fired upon both officers, striking Sin in the head and left leg and mortally wounding Tsang in the head. Sin and Tsang returned fire, with Sin missing 2 shots while Tsang hit Tsui with 5 shots to the torso and head, killing him. Tsang would re-holster his revolver and radio for help before succumbing to his wounds, while Sin would survive the incident. The revolver used by Tsui in the shootout was confirmed to be the service revolver taken from Constable Leung and used in the heist in 2001.Constable Sin was awarded the Medal for Bravery (Gold) for his actions and wrote a book about his experience.Mental state As the inquiry continued, Tsui was found to be an ambitious officer who often topped his class and did well in assessments. However, he was often denied promotions or opportunities to join elite units such as the Airport Security Unit.He was not media shy, as shown demonstrated by his appearance on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?and was happily photographed when he won the chance to buy his flat in a draw and during the 1 July March in 2004 where he was dressed in traditional Chinese funeral style clothing ('披麻戴孝').An associate professor of social science at the City University of Hong Kong suggested that Tsui, like many criminals, did not know how to face frustration, and chose instead to take an illegal path in obtaining socially approved goals, such as money, prestige or recognition.It was suggested that the police force should pay more attention to talented officers who fail to gain promotion, and recommended that there should be independent and confidential psychological counselling services for such troubled or frustrated officers.A Federal Bureau of Investigation criminal profiler believed that Tsui's behaviour fit into most of the definitions of schizotypal personality disorder, while an expert from the Queensland University of Technology said Tsui's personality profile matched that of a serial killer who believed he was destined to change the world, attempting to rise above his self-perceived unremarkable life and playing God by taking lives.Legacy The Tsui Po-ko case has inspired some film and television productions, including:Documentaries Anatomy of a Crime: 'HK's Rogue Cop'FictionMad Detective, a 2007 filmA Great Way to Care 《仁心解碼》, a 2009 TVB seriesThe Men of Justice, a 2010 ATV seriesShades of Rogue, a 2014 short filmReferences1970 births 2006 deaths 2006 crimes in Hong Kong 2006 in Hong Kong 21st-century criminals Hong Kong murderers Hong Kong police officers Hong Kong serial killers 2006 murders in Asia Male serial killers Murder in Hong Kong People from Nanping People shot dead by law enforcement officers in China People with schizotypal personality disorder Police misconduct Chinese bank robbers 2000s murders in Hong Kong", "machine_text": "Tsui Po-ko ( 鄒保激, 1936-2004) was a Hong Kong artist, educator, and collector.

The story revolves around the sudden and unexpected mobility of a skyscraper in New York City, which caused widespread panic and destruction in its path. The idea of a runaway skyscraper was a popular subject in science fiction during the early 20th century, and The Runaway Skyscraper was one of the earliest examples. The story centers around the fictional Skyscraper Holding Trust Company, which owns and operates a massive skyscraper in the heart of New York City. One day, the employees of the company notice strange vibrations in the building and soon realize that the entire skyscraper has become mobile, moving slowly and inexorably down the streets of the city. The story follows the various attempts to stop the runaway building and the fearful reactions of the people of New York as they witness the destruction caused by the towering structure. The story deals with themes of technological advancement and unchecked ambition, as well as the fear and panic that can arise in the face of the unknown and seemingly uncontrollable. It also serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of prioritizing profit and progress over safety and responsibility. The Runaway Skyscraper remains a notable work of early science fiction, and its influence can be felt in later works such as Isaac Asimov's 'The Last Question' and the film Godzilla, both of which deal with similar themes of technological power and unintended consequences.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 13268819}

The community has a partial presence in Person County. The population was 1,662 at the 2010 census. It was named in honor of longtime resident William Lea and is located along US 158 and NC 119 near Hyco Lake. Leasburg is also the name of a Caswell County township.History When Caswell County was created in 1777, the area that would become Leasburg was named as the county seat; however, a county courthouse was not built on the site until 1784, after the American Revolutionary War. When the area around the courthouse began to develop, the community decided to incorporate. The town of Leasburg was officially recognized by the North Carolina General Assembly in 1788. When the eastern section of Caswell County split and became Person County, a more geographically central location for the Caswell county seat was needed; so, in 1792 the courthouse was moved to an area which became known as 'Caswell Court House', which later changed its name to Yanceyville. Leasburg continued to develop after the courthouse relocation and eventually became known as the regional center for education. Numerous mills, factories, and farms prospered in the town until competition nearby from Durham doomed the area's tobacco industry. The Civil War left Leasburg in ruin, although many antebellum residences still remain.Famous former residents of Leasburg include Solomon Lea, the son of William Lea and the first president of Greensboro College, and Jacob Thompson, who served under President James Buchanan as Secretary of the Interior.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Colimaite\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Colimaite, the naturally occurring analog of synthetic K3VS4, is a sulfide mineral discovered in southwestern Mexico.The potassium-vanadium sulfide was collected from the crater of the Colima volcano.The mineral colimaite is named after the locality of this volcano and has been approved in 2007, along with its mineral name, by the Commission on New Minerals, Nomenclature and Classification (CNMNC).It has been given the International Mineralogical Association number of IMA 2007–045.Composition The chemical formula of colimaite is K3VS4. The enrichment of vanadium in Colima's volcanic gases make it unique. The study of sulfur content in the fumaroles is also important, in order to know how an eruption could affect global climate due to SO2 emissions.Structure Colimaite exhibits the Pnma (P 21/n 21/m 21/a) space group making it orthorhombic. The vanadium and sulfur atoms form tetrahedra.Potassium ions separate these tetrahedra in two different ways.In one case, the potassium ion is bound to five sulfur atoms at an average distance of 3.296 Å with an additional two sulfur atoms at a distance of 3.771 Å.In the other case, the potassium ion is bound to eight sulfur atoms at an average distance of 3.314 Å.In both cases, the potassium ions are in an irregular coordination polyhedron.Physical properties The formations of colimaite have been described as hedgehog–like particles due to the acicular habit of extremely fine needles forming the aggregates. The size of these aggregates range from 10 to 100 µm. The needles themselves have been measured up to 50 µm in length and 20 µm in width.Although colimaite belongs to the orthorhombic crystal class, their crystallographic forms were not observed.The particles were regular parallelepipeds and elongated rectangular prisms.The color of colimaite is dark golden and opaque. The streak is a yellow green with a resinous to greasy luster.It is non-fluorescent.It is brittle with no observed cleavage and a splintery fracture.Because of grain size, the hardness and density could not be measured but the density has been calculated to 2.235 g/cm3.Geological occurrence Colimaite occurs as a sublimate from the volcanic fumaroles of the Colima volcano in Mexico. Other minerals including cristobalite, arcanite, thenardite, baryte and native gold have been collected from the fumaroles of this volcano. Although minerals were collected at temperatures from 400 to 800 °C, colimaite was assembled in a more narrow temperature interval of 450 - 600 °C. There are similarities between the volcanic gases of the Colima crater and the gases of other volcanoes, but there are some differences that make Colima unique.Notable differences are the vanadium, zinc and copper enrichment of the Colima gases. These same gases also lack cadmium and molybdenum.Special characteristics Not only is colimaite the first new mineral species discovered in Mexico since 1998, but it is also the first newly recognized mineral species collected from the fumaroles of the Colima volcano crater. It was collected by the use of two silica tubes of one meter in length each, placed in a high temperature vent at the volcano's crater.ReferencesExternal links Entry on mindat.org Entry on webmineral.comSulfide minerals Orthorhombic minerals Minerals in space group 62", "machine_text": "Colimaite is a rare mineral found in the Colima volcano in Mexico. It was first discovered in 1948 by geologist Hans Ulrich Sauer, who found a new mineral in the ashes of the Colima eruption. Colimaite is a silicate mineral with the chemical formula of (K,Na)3(Mg,Fe)5Al1.3Si6.7O21(OH)4. The mineral is best identified by its distinct brown color and transparent to translucent nature. It is often found in small clusters or crystals, and is known for its unique crystal structure, which has not been found in any other mineral to date. Colimaite has several important properties, including its ability to absorb water and hold it within its structure. This has led to its use in various industries as a desiccant, or drying agent. It has also been used in manufacturing ceramics and as a component in semiconductors. Despite its usefulness, colimaite remains a relatively rare mineral, and is most commonly found in the Colima volcano region. Its limited availability has made it a prized possession among collectors and researchers alike, as the mineral offers valuable insights into the geology and formation of volcanic regions. In recent years, efforts to mine colimaite have been met with controversy, as some environmentalists have expressed concern over the impact of mining on the sensitive ecosystem of the Colima region. As a result, many efforts to extract the mineral have been put on hold, and researchers continue to work towards finding more sustainable methods of accessing this valuable mineral resource.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 25244611}

As the name of the village implies, it was a royal agricultural estate and it retains a winery complete with wine-cellar which unusually was built with royal patronage.It has a voluntary, but official, village council known as 'una entidad local menor' that presides over an area of 1126 hectares. The Spanish State Statistical Survey of 2013 found 296 male and 306 female residents.EtymologyThe settlement was named afterSan Isidro the farm-worker, the patron saint of farmers.HistoryReal Cortijo is notable because it was built as an experimental agricultural station in 1766 during the Enlightenment, which was inspired by King Carlos III, an enthusiastic physiocrat who was persuaded that the value of his kingdom lay more in its lands and people than in the gold and silver stored in its treasury.After the death of Carlos III, the Cortijo fell into decay, as his son, Carlos IV, showed little interest in agriculture. In 1868, during the reign of Isabel II, the farm was sold off.In 1944, after the civil war, the Spanish National Institute of Colonization sequestered the land. Previous owners and new settlers from various other provinces became tenants. The existing residential area was extended by the addition of newly built homes.In the 1950s local land and houses were sold to individuals. A royal decree of September 1957 formally established the local council as a legal entity. On 15 May, the saints-day of the patron San Isidro, a festival is celebrated which traditionally includes a lively sale of local farm and market-garden produce.FacilitiesIt possesses a great house La Casa Grande, a winery known as La Real Bodega de Carlos III, and an associated wine cellar, La Cueva. In 1788, the year in which Carlos III died, a neo-classical Church, La Ermita del Real Cortijo de San Isidro en Aranjuez, was added.ReferencesExternal links:wikivoyage:Aranjuez Wikimedia tourist guide projectOfficial homepage of Aranjuez City CouncilOfficial Tourist Agency website with comprehensive professional photographs of main attractionsPlanned communities in Spain Populated places in the Community of Madrid Aranjuez", "machine_text": "Real Cortijo de San Isidro Real Cortijo de San Isidro is a historical and cultural site located in the municipality of Madrid, Spain. Its origins date back to the 18th century when King Philip V ordered the construction of a farming estate to supply the royal household with food. The estate was named after the patron saint of Madrid, San Isidro, and was used for agricultural purposes until the early 20th century. The site consists of a group of buildings and structures that reflect the architectural styles of different periods. The central building, known as the Casa de la Rectoría, was built in the 18th century in the Spanish Baroque style. It served as the residence of the estate's rector or farm manager. Other buildings include the Casa de los Criados, which housed the servants and laborers, and the Casa de los Secretarios, which was used as a residence and office for the estate's administrative staff. In the late 19th century, King Alfonso XII ordered the renovation and expansion of the estate, which was transformed into a model farm. Modern facilities were added, including a dairy, a horse-breeding stable, and a greenhouse. The estate also had its own railway station, which was used to transport goods and animals. After the Spanish Civil War, Real Cortijo de San Isidro fell into neglect and disuse. It was declared a Cultural Heritage Site in 2005 and underwent a major renovation and restoration project that aimed to preserve its historical and cultural value. The project included the rehabilitation of the buildings, the restoration of the gardens and orchards, and the creation of a museum that showcases the history of the estate and its agricultural activities. Today, Real Cortijo de San Isidro is open to the public and serves as a cultural and educational center. Visitors can explore the gardens, orchards, and buildings, as well as attend workshops and events that promote sustainable agriculture and environmental conservation. The estate is also a popular venue for weddings and other celebrations. With its rich history and cultural significance, Real Cortijo de San Isidro is a unique and valuable asset to the city of Madrid.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 47003538}

Coyle.Plot A television mini-series told the life of Christ in a version of the typical Hollywood serial film. Each episode was thirty minutes long, bringing the total running time of the series to what might have been considered an epic six hours long if the films had been shown consecutively. Filmed in color in 1951, it is notable for being one of the few American film series of that time in which Christ's face was actually shown. Since the early days of sound, American film producers had been afraid that some members of the audience would be alienated if an actor who did not fit the public's image of Christ was chosen to play the role, so virtually all had played it safe by showing Him only from the back or in long shot. Sometimes only Christ's hand would be seen. Foreign film makers, however, had no such doubts, and Christ was actually shown in such films as the French Golgotha (1935), the Mexican El Martir del Calvario (1952), and the 1953 British serial Jesus of Nazareth.However, The Living Christ Series was not meant to be shown in movie theatres, but more as an instructional, inspirational film in churches or on Sunday-morning television. Far from being a religious epic, the series was clearly shot mostly on soundstages and on a low budget, much like a typical television program of the era shot on film. Directed by John T. Coyle, the series featured mostly unknown actors or actors who appeared mostly in B-films. A notable exception was Lowell Gilmore, who played Pontius Pilate, and whose most famous previous role was as Basil Hallward in MGM's classic 1945 film The Picture of Dorian Gray. Character actor Lawrence Dobkin also appeared in the series, and Will Wright, perhaps most famous for appearing as Ben Weaver on several episodes of The Andy Griffith Show, was cast as Herod. Martin Balsam also plays a small role. Screen unknown Robert Wilson, who would go on to practically make a career out of playing the role, portrayed Christ. Noted movie trailer announcer Art Gilmore served as narrator.The Living Christ Series, like other similar religiously-themed films, was released by Cathedral Films.

He was the youngest of Jesse James and Lula Novada (Bomar) Hatcher's four children. His father was a bootlegger, an ex‑convict and an abusive alcoholic. Hatcher was bullied in school, and in turn bullied his classmates and would carry this practice into adulthood.In the spring of 1935, he and his older brothers were flying a kite with copper wire they had found in an old ModelT Ford. His oldest brother, Arthur Allen, was about to hand the kite to him when it hit a high‑voltage power line and electrocuted him. Arthur was pronounced dead at the scene. Soon afterward, his father left home and divorced his mother. His mother remarried several times, and in 1945, Hatcher moved with his mother and her third husband to St.Joseph.Crimes1947–1963 In 1947, Hatcher was convicted of auto theft in St.Joseph after stealing a logging truck from Iowa–Missouri Walnut Company, his employer of two weeks. He received a two‑year suspended sentence. In 1948, he was convicted of auto theft a second time for stealing a 1937 Buick in St.Joseph. Hatcher was sentenced to two years in the Missouri State Penitentiary.On June 8, 1949, Hatcher was released from prison after serving a little more than half of his time. He was back in prison in just a few months, after being convicted of forging a 10 check at a gas station in Maryville, Missouri. On March 18, 1951, Hatcher escaped from prison and attempted a burglary. He was caught and received an extra two years in prison.After serving his additional time, Hatcher was released from prison on July 14, 1954. He stole a 1951 Ford in Orrick and was subsequently sentenced to four years in prison. Before he was sentenced, Hatcher attempted to escape from the Ray County Jail in Richmond and received an additional two years. On March 18, 1959, Hatcher was released from prison after the sixth prison sentence of his life.On June 26, 1959, Hatcher attempted to abduct Steven Pellham, a 16‑year‑old in St.Joseph who delivered newspapers, threatening him with a butcher knife. Pellham reported the crime, and Hatcher was arrested when the police stopped him in a stolen vehicle.Hatcher was sentenced to five years in the Missouri State Penitentiary for the attempted abduction and auto theft under the Habitual Criminal Act. While Hatcher was waiting to be transported to prison, he unsuccessfully attempted to break out of the Buchanan County Jail. When Hatcher arrived at the Missouri State Penitentiary, he claimed to be the most notorious criminal in northwest Missouri since Jesse James.On July 2, 1961, a 26-year-old inmate named Jerry Tharrington was found raped and stabbed to death on the floor of the prison kitchen loading dock. He had been repeatedly stabbed in the back. Hatcher was the only individual missing from the kitchen crew at the time of the murder. He was sent to solitary confinement for Tharrington's murder, but there was not enough evidence to convict him in court.While in solitary confinement for the murder, Hatcher wrote a note claiming that he needed psychiatric treatment; however, the prison psychologist felt that it was simply a scheme to get out of solitary and possibly out of prison early. Treatment was refused, and Hatcher was returned to the general population. His sentence was reduced to three‑quarters the original time, and he was released on August 24, 1963.1969–1977 Hatcher confessed to abducting a 12‑year‑old named William Freeman in Antioch, California on August 27, 1969. He claimed he had told the boy to come with him, took him to a creek, and strangled him.On August 29, 1969, six‑year‑old Gilbert Martinez was reported missing in San Francisco. According to the six‑year‑old girl with whom he was playing, Martinez walked away with a man who offered him ice cream. He was found by a man walking his dog as the boy was being beaten and sexually assaulted. Police arrived and arrested the assailant, who identified himself as Albert Ralph Price, although he carried identification with the name Hobert Prater. Martinez survived the assault, and Federal Bureau of Investigation records later identified the man as Charles R. Hatcher.Still going by the name Albert Price, Hatcher was charged with assault with attempt to commit sodomy and kidnapping. He was ordered to undergo competency evaluations to determine his competence to stand trial. A complete psychological evaluation was ordered when Hatcher was unresponsive during the preliminary evaluations. During this time, he claimed to hear voices, and faked delusions and suicide attempts to avoid prison.In December 1970, Hatcher was sent back and forth between the courts and hospital multiple times. One psychiatrist diagnosed him as having a passive–aggressive personality with paraphilia and pedophilia. It was reported that the hospital staff felt Hatcher was fabricating or exaggerating the symptoms of his mental disorders. He was examined by two psychiatrists in January 1971. He was declared insane by the first one, who recommended vigorous treatment in a secure hospital. The second psychiatrist declared him to be incompetent to stand trial and sent him back to the hospital.On May 24, 1971, Hatcher was sent to trial and pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. He was sent to a different hospital for more evaluations, where it was determined that he was unfit to stand trial. On June 2, Hatcher escaped from the hospital. He was caught a week later in Colusa, California and arrested for suspected auto theft under the name Richard Lee Grady. Hatcher was returned to the California State Hospital for a mental evaluation. In April 1972, hospital staff determined that his treatment was unsuccessful and that he was a danger to other patients, after which he was sent to the prison state hospital in Vacaville.In August 1972, Hatcher was transferred to San Quentin State Prison to stand trial, three years after the crime. He was ordered to undergo two final examinations: one declared him competent to stand trial and the other determined him to be sane at the time of the crime.In December 1972, Hatcher was tried for, and convicted of the abduction and molestation of Martinez. In January 1972, he was committed to the California State Hospital as a 'mentally disordered sexual offender'.On March 28, 1973, security guards found Hatcher hiding in a cooler near the hospital's main courtyard with two sheets stuffed into his pants, after which he admitted to an escape attempt. He was sent back to court for sentencing after doctors determined he was still a threat to society. In April, Hatcher was sentenced to one year to life and sent to a medium‑security prison in Vacaville.In May 1973, a psychologist found Hatcher to be a 'manipulative institutionalized sociopath'. In June 1973, he attempted suicide by slashing his wrists after it was recommended that he be transferred to a maximum security prison. A psychiatrist diagnosed him with paranoid schizophrenia, and he remained at Vacaville.In August 1975, guards reported good behavior at Hatcher's parole review. In June 1976, the California Parole Board found that Hatcher had improved dramatically through his time in prison and set a parole date of December 25, 1978. As a result of the passage of a bill giving inmates credit for time spent in jails and mental hospitals, Hatcher received a modified parole date in January 1977. He was released to a halfway house in San Francisco on May 20, 1977.1978–1982 On September 4, 1978, Hatcher was arrested under the name Richard Clark in Omaha, Nebraska for sexually assaulting a 16‑year‑old boy. He was sent to the Douglas County Mental Hospital and released in January 1979.On May 3, 1979, Hatcher was arrested for assault and attempted murder after he tried to stab seven‑year‑old Thomas Morton. He was sent to Norfolk Regional Center, a mental health facility, after the charges were dropped.In May 1980, Hatcher was released from the facility, but was sent back two months later for another assault. He escaped in September.On October 9, 1980, Hatcher was arrested as Richard Clark in Lincoln, Nebraska for the attempted assault and sodomy of a 17‑year‑old boy. He was sent to another mental health facility and released after 21 days.On January 13, 1981, Hatcher was arrested as Richard Clark in Des Moines, Iowa after a knife fight. He spent time in several mental health facilities and was released to a Davenport Salvation Army shelter in April.Melvin Reynolds On May 26, 1978, four‑year‑old Eric Christgen disappeared from downtown St. Joseph, Missouri. His body was later found along the Missouri River; he had been sexually abused and died of suffocation. The police questioned more than 100 possible suspects, including 'every known pervert in town', to no avail.One of them was Melvin Reynolds, a 25‑year‑old man of limited intelligence who had been sexually abused himself as a child and who had homosexual experiences as an adolescent. Reynolds, although agitated by the investigation, cooperated through several interrogations over a period of months, including two polygraph examinations and one interrogation under hypnosis. In December 1978, he was questioned under amobarbitalbelieved at the time to be a truth serumand made an ambiguous remark that intensified police suspicion. Two months later, in February 1979, the police brought the still cooperative Reynolds in for another round of interrogation: fourteen hours of questions, promises, and threats. Finally, Reynolds gave in and said, 'I'll say so if you want me to'.In the weeks that followed, Reynolds embellished this confession with details that were fed to him, deliberately or otherwise. That was enough to convince the prosecutor to charge Reynolds, and to convince a jury to convict him of second‑degree murder. He was sentenced to life imprisonment. Four years later, Reynolds was released when Charles Hatcher confessed to three murders to an FBI agent, including that of Eric Christgen.Death On July 29, 1982, 11‑year‑old Michelle Steele was reported missing from St.Joseph. The day after, her uncle found her nude, ravaged body on a bank of the Missouri River. She had been beaten and strangled to death.Hatcher was arrested the following day, as he tried to check in at the St.Joseph State Hospital. While awaiting trial, he confessed to fifteen other murders dating from 1969. The first victim, 12‑year‑old William Freeman, had disappeared from Antioch, California in August of that year, one day before Hatcher was charged with child molestation in nearby San Francisco. In another case, Hatcher penned a crude map that led searchers to the remains of 28-year-old James Churchill, buried on the grounds of the Rock Island Army Arsenal, near Davenport, Iowa. It was then that he also confessed to the murder of Eric Christgen.He was convicted of the Christgen homicide in October 1983, and drew a term of life imprisonment with no parole for at least 50 years. Facing his second Missouri conviction a year later for the murder of Michelle Steele, Hatcher requested a death sentence, but the jury refused, recommending life on December 3, 1984. Four days later, Hatcher hanged himself in his cell, at the Missouri State Penitentiary in Jefferson City.See alsoList of serial killers in the United StatesList of serial killers by number of victimsNotesReferencesCited works and further reading1929 births 1984 suicides 20th-century American criminals American escapees American male criminals American murderers of children American people convicted of murder American people convicted of theft American people who died in prison custody American prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment American rapists American serial killers American sex offenders Escapees from Missouri detention Fugitives LGBT people from Missouri Male serial killers People convicted of murder by Missouri People from Mound City, Missouri People from St. Joseph, Missouri People with antisocial personality disorder Prisoners and detainees of California Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment by Missouri Prisoners who died in Missouri detention Serial killers who committed suicide in prison custody Suicides by hanging in Missouri Violence against men in North America", "machine_text": "Charles Ray Hatcher was an American serial killer who is known to have killed 16 people and suspected of killing at least three more.

Hatcher's criminal history began in his teenage years, where he was arrested for stealing cars and committing burglaries. In the 1960s, he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and was institutionalized for a brief period. However, he was released and resumed his criminal activities. Throughout the 1970s, Hatcher committed a series of murders, with his victims including women, children, and elderly individuals. He was known for leaving behind a distinct pattern of violence that would go on to link him to other murders. Hatcher was finally arrested in 1982, after DNA evidence linked him to the murder of Nancy Kitzmiller, a four-year-old girl whose body was found in Missouri. Following his arrest, he confessed to several of his other murders and was convicted for 16 counts of homicide. Hatcher's case is notable for being one of the first to use DNA evidence in a criminal trial. He was sentenced to life in prison and died of heart failure in 1984. Though he is known to have killed 16 people, it is suspected that his actual death toll is much higher.

The Durham Ox Junction was also crossed by a road, leading to many delays. The junction was crossed by Pelham Bridge in the mid-1950s. Until its closure St. Marks was the mainline station, with through services from Cleethorpes to London King's Cross. Prior to closure of the Lincoln-to-Grantham line during the Beeching Axe, London services had used Lincoln Central.To avoid unnecessarily operating two stations, St Marks closed in 1985; services were diverted to the nearby Lincoln Central. The construction of a new 80-metre length of track to the west allowed services from Newark Castle station to reach Lincoln Central.

The first European settlers, the Acadians are descendants of French settlers and also some of the Indigenous peoples of Acadia, a French colony in what is today Nova Scotia. The Acadians were expelled by the British (1755) for refusing to take an oath of allegiance to King George II which drove several thousand Acadian residents into exile in North America, the UK and France during the French and Indian War. (Those American Acadians who wound up in Louisiana, and other parts of the American South, are often referred to as Cajuns, although some Cajuns are not of Acadian origin.) In time, some Acadians returned to the Maritime provinces of Canada, mainly to New Brunswick, due to the British prohibiting them from resettling their lands and villages in what became Nova Scotia.Many of the English-Canadian population of New Brunswick are descended from Loyalists who fled the American Revolution. This is commemorated in the province's motto, Spem reduxit ('hope was restored'). There is also a significant population with Irish ancestry, especially in Saint John and the Miramichi Valley.

Green (March 17, 1842March 10, 1926), was an American author of humorous novels.Early life Isabel (nickname, 'Belle') Colton was born in Pittsfield, Vermont, on March 17, 1842. Her ancestors were a mix of American, English and Native American. One of her ancestors on her father's side married a Native American princess belonging to a Massachusetts tribe, and settled in that state. Her mother, Lucy Baker, came from Puritan stock; she died at the age of 47, leaving her husband and a family of six girls. Isabel, who was next to the youngest, was four years old at the time. She was taken into the family of a distant relative living in Nashua, New Hampshire, where she was reared and educated in strictest orthodox ways.Career It was not till the year 1881 that Belle Greene began her literary work in earnest. She sent a short story and a humorous sketch to her friend, Elizabeth Stuart Phelps, asking for advice and encouragement. Phelps replied with characteristic honesty and kindness that Greene's voice was doubtless her one great gift, and, as mortals were seldom blessed with two, she advised her to stick to music, but added, since she must give an opinion, that she considered the humorous sketch better than the story. Upon this scanty encouragement Greene offered the humorous sketch to Godey's Lady's Book, and it was accepted. She continued to furnish sketches for a year or more, and concluded her work for the magazine by writing her first story proper, a novelette, afterward published in book form under the title A New England Idyl (1886).She wrote also for Youths Companion and Harpers Weekly.Adventures of an Old Maid (1886), a second book, was a collection of humorous sketches published first in the magazines, and sold over 75,000 copies. Her religious novel, A New England Conscience (1885), attracted wide comment. Though severely denounced by some of the critics, it was regarded by others as a masterpiece of condensed thought and realistic character drawing.Other works include: Mr. and Mrs. Hannibal Hawkins (1897), The hobbledehoy; the story of one betwixt boy and man (1895), Hobbly Dr. Hoe (the story of a man who attempted to understand the mind of a boy).In 1887–88, Greene made an extended tour of southern California and the Pacific Coast, and during her stay of several months in Los Angeles and San Diego she contributed to the newspapers a series of humorous sketches founded upon the phases of the boom, which added greatly to her reputation as a humorous writer. These last-mentioned articles constitute her only newspaper work, with the exception of the Mill Papers, regarding the operatives in the cotton-mills, written for the Boston Transcript in 1883 and 1884.Personal life In 1868, Colton married Martin Van Buren Greene, of Nashua, New Hampshire. They had one son, Edward Martin Greene, who became Professor of Romance Languages at the University of South Dakota. Edward was his mother's constant companion on several trips across the continent to California, as well to Europe.She used to spend summers with her sister in Palatine, Illinois, since 1910. She died there on March 10, 1926, and is buried at Hillside Cemetery.Her grandson, John Colton Greene, a former president of the History of Science Society and winner of its 2002 George Sarton Medal for outstanding scholarly achievement, was a Professor of History at the University of Connecticut.References1842 births 1926 deaths 19th-century American women writers 19th-century American novelists People from Pittsfield, Vermont", "machine_text": "Belle C.

She then went on to become the library's first curator of the Berg Collection of English and American Literature. In 1937, when the library's previous director, John Shaw Billings, died, Belle Greene was appointed as the first woman and fifth director of the library. She served in this role until her retirement in 1941. During her tenure, she oversaw the construction of a new library branch. Under Greene's leadership, the library began to offer a variety of new services, such as a circulating division for music, audiovisual materials, and outreach programs to provide library services to non-users. She also played a significant role in acquiring many notable collections, including the Robert Louis Stevenson Collection and the Walt Whitman Collection. Greene was an advocate of cultural diversity and was committed to making the library a place where all people could feel welcome.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Internal wave\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Internal waves are gravity waves that oscillate within a fluid medium, rather than on its surface. To exist, the fluid must be stratified: the density must change (continuously or discontinuously) with depth/height due to changes, for example, in temperature and/or salinity. If the density changes over a small vertical distance (as in the case of the thermocline in lakes and oceans or an atmospheric inversion), the waves propagate horizontally like surface waves, but do so at slower speeds as determined by the density difference of the fluid below and above the interface. If the density changes continuously, the waves can propagate vertically as well as horizontally through the fluid.Internal waves, also called internal gravity waves, go by many other names depending upon the fluid stratification, generation mechanism, amplitude, and influence of external forces. If propagating horizontally along an interface where the density rapidly decreases with height, they are specifically called interfacial (internal) waves. If the interfacial waves are large amplitude they are called internal solitary waves or internal solitons. If moving vertically through the atmosphere where substantial changes in air density influences their dynamics, they are called anelastic (internal) waves. If generated by flow over topography, they are called Lee waves or mountain waves. If the mountain waves break aloft, they can result in strong warm winds at the ground known as Chinook winds (in North America) or Foehn winds (in Europe). If generated in the ocean by tidal flow over submarine ridges or the continental shelf, they are called internal tides. If they evolve slowly compared to the Earth's rotational frequency so that their dynamics are influenced by the Coriolis effect, they are called inertia gravity waves or, simply, inertial waves. Internal waves are usually distinguished from Rossby waves, which are influenced by the change of Coriolis frequency with latitude.Visualization of internal waves An internal wave can readily be observed in the kitchen by slowly tilting back and forth a bottle of salad dressing - the waves exist at the interface between oil and vinegar.Atmospheric internal waves can be visualized by wave clouds: at the wave crests air rises and cools in the relatively lower pressure, which can result in water vapor condensation if the relative humidity is close to 100", "machine_text": "Internal waves are waves that occur within a fluid medium, such as ocean currents, where the density changes gradually with depth. These waves differ from surface waves, which occur at the interface between fluids with different densities. Internal waves are generated by a variety of sources, such as tides and winds, and can propagate over long distances in the ocean. As the waves move through the fluid, they create areas of relatively high and low pressure, which can affect the movement of the surrounding water. One of the most important effects of internal waves is their impact on ocean mixing. As the waves propagate, they can interact with the horizontal and vertical gradients in density, leading to turbulent mixing and the transfer of energy and nutrients across different depths. This mixing has important implications for marine life, affecting the distribution of plankton and other organisms, as well as for ocean currents and climate models. Internal waves can also have significant effects on shipping and offshore structures, such as oil platforms. When these waves interact with the ocean floor, they can create strong currents that can damage the foundations and infrastructure of offshore structures. Researchers continue to study the complex dynamics of internal waves in order to better understand their impacts on ocean systems and to develop more accurate models to predict their behavior. Improving our knowledge of these waves and their interactions with the ocean can lead to better management of ocean resources and more effective mitigation of natural disasters such as tsunamis.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 900160}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Felling, Tyne and Wear\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Felling is an eastern suburb of Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, England. The town was formed when three villages coalesced in the 19th century. Historically part of County Durham, the town was subsumed into the metropolitan borough of Gateshead in 1974. It lies on the B1426 Sunderland Road and the A184 Felling bypass, less thaneast of Gateshead town centre,south east of Newcastle-upon-Tyne and 10 miles north west of the City of Sunderland. In 2011, Felling had a population of 8,908.The history of Felling stretches almost eight hundred years. The original manor at Felling was granted in the 13th century and passed through several families until it was passed to the Brandling family in 1509. While Lords of the Manor, several members of this family served as Members of Parliament among other civic duties. They were also instrumental in bringing heavy industry to the area, and Felling Colliery (John Pit), one of the oldest and largest collieries in the region, was developed on their estate. The colliery was the site of two mining disasters which cost over one hundred lives, helping prompt Sir Humphry Davy and George Stephenson to develop their safety lamps (there is a monument to the workers lost in St Mary's churchyard, Heworth). Other heavy industry took root in the 18th and 19th centuries so that Felling developed from a rural scattering of villages into firstly three distinct settlements at Low and High Felling and Felling Shore, then in 1894 these amalgamated with other local villages into the town of Felling, administered by the Felling Urban District Council at Sunderland Road. The areas that Felling council were responsible for were Felling, High Felling, Windy Nook, Whitehills Estate, Leam-Lane Estate, Pelaw, Wardley, Heworth, Bill Quay and Follingsby. The council was disbanded in 1974 when Felling was wholly incorporated into the new Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead.Felling today is broadly residential save some light industry located at the bank of the River Tyne in north Felling. It is governed locally and nationally by the Labour Party. The vast majority of residents identify as white British and, in the north areas particularly, there are high levels of unemployment and deprivation. It is well served by public transport; there are several bus services through the area and Felling lies on the Tyne and Wear Metro line and there are stations at Gateshead Stadium and Felling. Felling town centre remains the principal economic area and has recently benefitted from a £13.5 million regeneration project, with the demolition of the old Co-op supermarket and council building and rebuilding of the town shopping centre shopping units, which now run parallel to a new Asda superstore. The long and rich history of the area is reflected by over a dozen listed buildings, several churches and numerous public houses which are locally listed. It is served by several schools, though levels of educational qualification among residents are comparably low. Leisure provision is good, with four distinctive parks and various riverside facilities. Gateshead International Stadium lies in the area and several professional footballers hail from Felling, including former England international Chris Waddle, as does award-winning author David Almond.HistoryEarly historyThe name of Felling is recorded as early as 1217 and, in 1920, was said to refer to a clearing where woods and trees were felled. Since there are no other places in Britain which bear this name, despite country-wide tree felling, it is much more likely to be because it lies on the eastern descent of a Fell, which rises from Team Valley in the west to Low Fell, then still rising to High Fell, before descending down to the Tyne through Felling. Ing is a place name ending which means 'the people of'. In the 13th century, the Prior of Durham enfeoffed Sir Walter de Selby a manor at Felling 'to hold by homage, fealty, knights' service, two marks rent, and suit at the prior's every fortnight'. The estate then passed to Walter's son, Adam, whose own son forfeited the estate the manor upon his death, whereupon it was passed to Ralph de Applingden. In 1331, the manor was granted to Sir Thomas Surtees by Bishop Lewis Beaumont, who passed it to his son Alexander and whose own son, Thomas, inherited the estate in 1400 when he was only 20 weeks old. Thomas lived only 35 years, but is notable for having been High Sheriff of Northumberland in 1422. The estate continued to pass through the Surtees family until 1509, when the last surviving member of that family died.There followed a period of extensive litigation as the future of the considerable Surtees estate, which also included Low Dinsdale Manor near Darlington, was contested between the families Brandling, a staunchly Royalist and Catholic family, Blaxton and Wyclyffe. While several elements of the estate where divided by share, in 1509 the entire manor of Felling was granted by Deed of Partition to Robert Brandling and his heirs 'for life and to the total extinction' of any other claims.The Brandling familyBrandling duly lived at Felling with his wife Anne. He became sheriff of Newcastle-upon-Tyne in 1524, was mayor of Newcastle five times and was knighted by the Duke of Somerset at Mussleburgh. When he died in 1568, the estate passed to his brother Thomas. In 1605, Thomas' grandson, Robert Brandling, inherited the manor. Robert Brandling was granted Newminster Abbey by King James in 1610, served as High Sheriff of Northumberland in 1617 and was in 1621 elected Member of Parliament for Morpeth. When he died in 1636, the estate passed to his son, Sir Francis Brandling. Francis was also an MP, albeit for Northumberland, between 1624 and 1625 though he abandoned Felling in favour of residence at Alnwick Abbey. He died in 1641 and was succeeded by Charles Brandling, a cavalry colonel who also resided at both Felling and Alnwick. Charles had two brothers. The older of which, Ralph, was killed at the Battle of Marston Moor, while the second brother, Robert, also participated in the English Civil War and was captured in an otherwise successful Royalist engagement at Corbridge in February 1644 after which he switched sides and fought for the Roundheads; an action which earned him the reputation as 'a very knave' which he carried until his death in 1669.Early industrialisation 1680–1800By the turn of the 18th century, Felling consisted of little more than the large Brandling estate and a small scattering of tiny farming villages. However, Ralph Brandling, the incumbent of the Brandling estate at that time, had come to realise the value of the rich coal deposits on his estate and began drift mining around 1670. He initially found the large coal seams under his estate difficult to extract due to their depth, and indeed it was imported coal from Newcastle-upon-Tyne which saw the development of more extensive industries in salt, glass and chemicals which began to attract workers to the area. At around 1750, a large copper-works was opened at the banks of the River Tyne; the first such works to be developed on the river. Encouraged by these developments, Ralph Brandling's son, Charles Brandling, firstly commissioned more extensive mining of near-surface coal on his estate and then, encouraged by the discovery of several strata below his estate, began boring operations in 1758 to allow ultimately for deeper coal extraction. The result was the opening of Felling Colliery in 1779, working on the High Main stratum at a depth of 125 fathoms. A brown paper mill was also opened in 1798.Felling mining disastersOn 19 January 1811, the original High Main seam at Felling Colliery was closed, but by that time the colliery had grown enormously.The colliery was deepened to reach the Low Main seam.Two shafts were provided: John Pit and William Pit.The Low Main and began operation in October 1810. Disaster struck Felling Colliery on 25 May 1812 when, despite the colliery containing the most up-to-date safety measures, firedamp ignited and at around 11.30 am, 'one of the most tremendous explosions in the history of coal mining took place'. Two explosions rocked the colliery, the blast appearing in both pits.A cloud of coal dust and debris over a radius of a mile and a half was ejected from the colliery. One account recalled:Immense quantities of dust and coal rose high into the air in an inverted cone...In the village of Heworth, this cloud caused a darkness like that of early twilight and covered the roads so thickly that the footsteps of passengers were deeply imprinted in it. As soon as the explosion was heard, wives and children of the workmen ran to the pit. Wildness and terror were pictured in every countenance. The crowd soon collected to several hundreds, some crying out for a husband, others for a parent or a son, and all affected by a mixture of horror, anxiety and grief.Following the first blast at 11:30, rescue attempts started at 12:15.At 14:00 the second blast occurred and no further rescues occurred.Some 29 men were saved, but the remaining 92 men and boys were killed.Two days later the decision was made to seal the colliery to starve the fire of oxygen.Just one year later, on 24 December 1813, a further catastrophe occurred:About half-past one o'clock on the morning, an explosion took place in Felling colliery, by which nine men and thirteen boys were hurried into eternity, several others severely burnt, and all the underground horses but one destroyed. The accident occurred at the time of calling course, or when one set of men were relieving another. Several of the morning shift men were standing round the mouth of the pit, waiting to go down, when the blast occurred, and the part who had just descended met it soon after they had reached the bottom of the shaft; these were most miserably burnt and mangled.The 200th anniversary of the first disaster was commemorated in Felling on 25 May 2012 by a parade from St Mary's Church at Heworth to the place of the entrance to the colliery at Mulberry Street.The Industrial RevolutionIn spite of the disaster, Felling continued to grow and by the time of the explosions the character of Felling had changed substantially. There now existed three distinct villages. Around two miles south east of Gateshead lay High Felling; a residential village in the township of Heworth which had attracted several Wesleyan and Methodist preachers. Slightly to the north lay Low Felling. This was a more heavily industrialised village, containing Felling colliery, a large chemical works and other manufacturers, though in 1834 it was noted that there also existed 'a few neat houses and many cottages for the colliery which, with small gardens attached, give an aspect of comfort to the village'. At the north and on the bank of the River Tyne, a populous manufacturing and trading village had developed known as Felling Shore, spreading across three miles of the bank of the Tyne. A Methodist church was built there in 1805. This was accompanied by several shops and four public houses frequented predominantly by seamen and workers at the adjacent quay, coal staithes and ship building works where vessels of excellent quality were built. Industry continued to flourish here; the copperworks established in the 18th century still operated and had expanded, an oil and a paper mill had also developed, along with forging works for anchors and shovels.In 1827 the Friars Goose Chemical Works was opened by Anthony Clapham. In 1834 a second large chemical works was established by Hugh Lee Pattinson, John Lee and George Burnett; it soon employed around 300 men. Grindstone quarries produced high quality stone and a brownware pottery under Mr. Joseph Wood had opened for business. In 1842, Brandling Station was opened at Mullbery Street in Felling on the Brandling Junction railway linking Gateshead, South Shields and Sunderland. This is one of the oldest passenger stations in the world.By around 1870, Felling had reached its industrial peak. Historian John Marius Wilson noted:FELLING, a large village and a chapelry in Jarrow parish, Durham. The village stands on the Northeastern railway, 1½ mile SE of Gateshead; increased recently from two hamlets to its present condition; is maintained by factories and by mining operations; connects with Felling-Shore, a coal-shipping place on the Tyne; and has a post-office under Gateshead, a r. station, a church built in 1866, four dissenting chapels, and a Roman Catholic chapel. The chapelry was constituted in 1866. Population 5,105. The living is a vicarage. Value, £300. Patrons, Five Trustees.1870 – present dayThe industrial heights proved reasonably short-lived. By 1860, improvements to access along the River Tyne only served to highlight the better sites on the Tyne bank and so shipbuilding at Felling Shore began to decline. This decline was hastened by the limited space at Felling dock, which could not reasonably be extended and so progress enjoyed elsewhere was never matched at Felling. At around the same time, the chemical industry began to stall as bigger and more efficient competitors overtook their Felling counterparts. The industrial decline was matched by continuous residential growth, so that by the Victorian era those industrial elements which survived were met by a large sprawl of housing from the south where High and Low Felling had effectively merged.At 10:52 am on 26 March 1907, an express passenger train travelling from Heworth signal box derailed on the approach to Felling station. The cause was a combination of a sharp frost in the morning and unseasonal heat later in the day which saw the track expand and kink. The derailment, which saw all bar two carriages rolled over entirely, cost two passengers their lives, with eight more seriously hurt and a further 34 suffering minor injuries such as shock.The decline of heavy industry, meanwhile, continued apace. In 1932 the large chemical works at Felling Shore closed and was left derelict, leaving behind a 2 million tonne heap of spoil. Felling Colliery, the oldest and most extensive of all Felling's industry, had changed hands numerous times after the Brandlings finally sold their stake in the 1850s and ultimately closed in 1931 with the loss of 581 jobs. Fairs boat yard at Felling Shore had been sold in 1919 and became Mitchison's ship yard, but this too closed in 1964.In place of industry came housing. The high density terraced housing which had accompanied the industrial boom of the 19th century had sprawled south and was soon joined by a wave of development at the run of the 20th century.The earlier housing came at Stuart Street, Temple Street and Helmsdale Avenue in the form of Tyneside flats. In the inter-war years, whole derelict industrial areas were cleared and large council estates of semi-detached houses, with front and back gardens, were built at the Old Fold, Stoneygate, Brandling and Nest estates. By the time that Felling ceased to be an independent town and was incorporated into the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead in 1974, Felling had become a 'dormitory area' and remains so today.EconomyThere are two principal economic areas in Felling. The first of these is at Felling Shore, where the East Gateshead Riverside Park was built in 1966 and which, combined with the Felling Shore industrial estate, today houses 241 businesses employing around 6,400 people. The second is in central Felling in the town centre area around Victoria Square. The town centre has seen massive investment over recent years, with the complete redevelopment of the main shopping centre and addition of a new Asda superstore, a Greggs bakery, Card Factory shop, Subway sandwich outlet and a local taxi business. Other amenities include a Post Office, Heron Foods store and several bookmakers, as well as 4 public houses and fast food outletsThe Felling Health Care Centre is the main source of General Healthcare for the town's population, and houses St Alban's medical group and Crowhall Medical Group. The GP surgery also has a small Boots pharmacy in addition to the larger Boots store in the town centre.Felling has one small dentist practice located on the B1426 main commuter road that connects Heworth to Gateshead town centreLevels of unemployment in Felling are high.

Historically, Felling was a rural village based around farming and agriculture. However, during the Industrial Revolution, the area became a hub for coal mining and shipbuilding industries. As a result, the population of the village grew rapidly, and many workers migrated to Felling from all parts of the United Kingdom. Felling saw significant redevelopment in the 1960s and 70s, whereby many of the old Victorian terraced houses were replaced by new high-rise flats and maisonettes. Despite this transformation, Felling has still managed to retain some of its historical features and there are some traditional shops and old buildings that can be found around the village. Felling is well-connected with the rest of Gateshead and Newcastle by road, rail and bus. There are excellent transport links to Newcastle City Centre from Felling, including regular bus services by Go North East and Stagecoach, and frequent trains from Felling Railway Station to Newcastle Central Station via Gateshead Interchange.

The species is known from several well-preserved fossils, including the famous Taung Child, discovered by Raymond Dart in 1924. A. africanus was a bipedal primate with a small brain (roughly one-third the size of a modern human brain) and relatively large jaws and teeth. It is classified as an early human ancestor and is believed to have played an important role in the evolution of the genus Homo, which includes modern humans. The most complete A. africanus fossils have been found in South Africa, specifically in the Sterkfontein, Makapansgat and Taung sites. These fossils help us learn about the physical characteristics and behavior of these early hominids. One notable characteristic of A. africanus is its powerful chewing muscles, which suggest that it had a tough, fibrous diet of predominantly plant material. A. africanus' skull also exhibits some adaptations for bipedalism, such as a more vertically oriented foramen magnum (the hole in the skull where the spinal cord enters), but it also had features associated with a partially arboreal lifestyle, such as curved fingers capable of grasping branches. A. africanus had a complex social structure that involved males leaving their natal group to find mates and form new groups. This behavior is similar to that seen in some modern primates, such as chimpanzees. Australopithecus africanus is a significant species in human evolution because it marks the transition from a more ape-like ancestor to a species more similar to modern humans. It was the next set of changes that occurred in later hominids that would eventually lead to the emergence of Homo habilis, the first species within the genus Homo, and ultimately to our own species, Homo sapiens.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1627000}

The cast was also well-liked, with Rod Cameron in particular being praised for his portrayal of the stoic, no-nonsense rancher. Although Stampede is now considered a somewhat obscure film, it holds a special place in Western cinema history. Its use of Technicolor and its focus on the dangers of stampedes helped to set it apart from other Westerns of the era and made it a memorable entry in the genre.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 34327526}

Text (in German)ButterfliesRepublic of the Congo Butterflies Republic of the Congo", "machine_text": "List of Butterflies of the Republic of the Congo The Republic of Congo, located in Central Africa, is home to a rich butterfly fauna, comprising more than 700 species. These include a variety of exotic, colorful, and diverse species that inhabit the vast tropical forests, savannahs, wetlands, and grasslands of the country. In this article, we will explore some of the most notable and interesting butterflies that can be found in the country. Papilio antimachus, also called the 'Emperor Swallowtail,' is a spectacular butterfly that can be found in the Republic of Congo. This large, black, and yellow butterfly has a wingspan of up to 28 cm (11 in) and is known for its striking coloration and graceful flight. Another noticeable butterfly is the Graphium policenes, which is also called the 'Green-banded Swallowtail.' This butterfly belongs to the Papilionidae family, and its wings are marked with green bands that shimmer in the sunlight. The Bicyclus anynana, also known as the 'Squinting bush brown,' is a common species found in the savannah and grasslands of the country. It is greyish-brown in color, and is easily identified by its curved wings and dark eye spots. This species is known for its unique behavior of 'hill-topping,' a phenomenon where males gather at the top of hills to compete for females. The Charaxes smaragdalis, or 'Emerald Gladiator,' is a large, iridescent green butterfly that is widespread throughout the forests of the Congo. This butterfly belongs to the Nymphalidae family, and its wingspan can reach up to 13 cm (5 in). Another Nymphalidae species found in Congo is the Junonia leucosticta, also called the 'Spectacled Bush Brown.' This butterfly has distinctive white spots on its wings that look like spectacles, hence its name. There are also many species of Lycaenidae butterflies found in the Republic of Congo. The Cupidopsis cissus, for example, is an iridescent blue butterfly that can be found in the forest, while the Zeritis clarkedixonii, also known as the 'Zebra Blue,' is a small, black-and-white butterfly that can be found in the savannah regions. In conclusion, the butterfly fauna of the Republic of Congo is diverse and rich, comprising many beautiful and interesting species.

The members of this genus are commonly known as 'claybacks' due to the characteristic shape of their thorax. Currently, there are approximately 20 described species under this genus. These moths are usually brown or gray, with white, black, or brown markings on their wings. Their wingspans range from 2 to 5 centimeters, and they have hairy bodies. The larvae of Eudarcia species feed on various plants, including grasses, wildflowers, and shrubs. The life cycle of Eudarcia species starts with the eggs, which are laid on the undersides of leaves. The larvae hatch from the eggs and go through several molts before pupating. The pupae are usually found in the soil or in leaf litter, and after a few weeks, they transform into the adult moths. Eudarcia species are nocturnal, and they are attracted to lights at night. They are often found in gardens, fields, and other open areas where their preferred food plants grow. Although Eudarcia species are not considered pests, they may cause damage to crops in large numbers. Additionally, some species are known to occasionally cause skin irritation in humans. Several species within the Eudarcia genus have not been thoroughly studied, and their distribution and ecology remain poorly understood. Further research is needed to understand the biology and conservation status of all Eudarcia species.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 24138826}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Singapore Dreaming\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Singapore Dreaming is a 2006 Singaporean drama film. It follows the Loh family, a typical Singaporean working-class family, through their aspirations and dreams for a better and affluent life and the reality that would make it difficult for them to fulfill these aspirations.The film is inspired by a 2000 Singaporean essay titled Paved with Good Intentions, that the writers of the film had written for the Singapore International Foundation. A concatenation of e-mails Singaporeans sent to writers Colin Goh and Woo Yen Yen on their life stories in relation to the Singaporean dream eventually led them to write, produce and direct Singapore Dreaming. The film stars Richard Low as Poh Huat, Alice Lim as Siew Luan, Serene Chen as Irene, Yeo Yann Yann as Mei, Lim Yu-Beng as CK and Dick Su as Seng.The film was theatrically released on 7 September 2006, and at one time ranked fifth on the Singaporean box office. It has been acclaimed as one of the best Singaporean films of the 2000s. It won the Montblanc New Screenwriters Award at the 54th San Sebastián International Film Festival, and was the first such Singaporean film to receive an IFFPA-recognised international feature film award. Owing to its nature as a local film, Singapore Dreaming received much attention from Singaporean viewers, film critics and public figures alike, including S. R. Nathan, the then President of Singapore. It has been praised by local critics as a relatable portrayal of working-class life in Singapore.Plot Poh Huat (Richard Low), the father of the Loh family, works as a lawyer's clerk. He is married to Siew Luan (Alice Lim), a housewife who likes to brew liang teh (herbal tea) for the family. Poh Huat has a habit of buying lottery tickets in hope of winning and enjoying a better life. He also keeps newspaper cuttings of car models and condominiums and stores them in a box in his room.The family has one son, Seng (Dick Su), and one daughter, Mei (Yeo Yann Yann). Despite Mei's superior academic performance, the family has consistently shown favouritism for Seng. Even though he was ostensibly the academically poorer sibling, dropping out of school in Secondary 3, his parents still chose to fund his overseas polytechnic education instead of furthering his sister's education. Seng is due to return after two years at Dubois Polytechnical University (at Idaho). To fund his overseas studies, he had to borrow extra money from his fiancée, Irene (Serene Chen), who stays with Seng's parents.Mei works as a secretary who maintains a friendly working relationship with her boss. She is due for delivery in two months' time, and for maternity leave in a month's time. Her husband, Chin Keong (Lim Yu-Beng), quit his job in the Singapore Armed Forces a month before and is now selling insurance, though unsuccessfully. He is therefore belittled by Mei. Even though they cannot afford it, they frequently go to a condominium showroom to take a look, revealing their aspirations for a more luxurious lifestyle.Seng returns from the United States. Tensions escalate in the family between Mei and Seng, due to the family's apparent favouritism for Seng. Seng goes for several job interviews, but is unsuccessful. He becomes immensely disappointed, and lies to his family about the sanguinity of his job prospects.Poh Huat strikes the Toto lottery, winning S2 million, and the family is ecstatic. Seng decides that he wants to try starting a business. He gains his father's approval, who gives him effectively unlimited funding through a credit card. Seng also buys a car, without Irene's knowledge. Irene is infuriated when she learns Seng has been overspending without working first.Initially thrilled by his sudden elevation to the higher social class, Poh Huat dies suddenly of a heart attack while he was at a country club for a membership interview. Siew Luan goes into shock. At the funeral, Seng quarrels with Mei over the funeral expenses. Mei vents her anger on Chin Keong, who shows his displeasure by throwing the carton of drinks on the floor and storming off. Mei is called back to work one afternoon, even though she is still managing the funeral. Chin Keong expresses his outrage at this unreasonable request, but Mei says out of frustration, 'Singapore is like that, everywhere is like that, do we have a choice?' and returns to work. At work, Mei's boss, frustrated at the incapable temporary secretary, vents his anger at Mei and demands her to photocopy a stack of documents and brew coffee for him. Mei flips at the triviality of the task.Back at the funeral, Mei realizes that S500 has gone missing from the pek kim, and wrongly accuses her Filipino maid, Pinky, of stealing the money. Chin Keong reveals shortly after that the money is actually with him. Pinky, indignant at the wrong accusation, spits at Mei. Chin Keong goes to a nearby coffee shop for a drink. A beer girl from Mainland China approaches him at his table to talk to him, and Chin Keong ends up confiding his worries about life. The girl notes, 'You Singaporeans are always complaining. Do you think your life is tough?'. During the funeral wake, Seng reveals to his family that he did not graduate. Initially unbeknownst to him, Irene is standing nearby at the door, and hears his confession. Irene is greatly disappointed with Seng, and resolves to leave him.A few months later, Chin Keong, Seng and Mei, with her newly-born son, are called to a lawyer's office. It is revealed that Poh Huat's will has been found (made before either of them are born): he had left all his assets to his wife Siew Luan. However, the family has chalked up a debt of S800,000 in sending Seng overseas. Siew Luan is absent from the meeting, so the lawyer announces that, of the remaining S1, 200,000, Mei is getting S300,000, while Seng is getting S1,000. At the movie's end, Siew Luan hands some money over to Poh Huat's mistress and illegitimate son in a show of benevolence, and leaves Seng. Irene decides to go abroad to pursue a degree in photography.Cast A team of local actors composed the cast for Singapore Dreaming. Some casting decisions were made when the producers were penning the script in New York while others were made in Singapore.The characters of the film were based on the experiences of the people around the writers, that of the writers themselves, and on the e-mail responses that they received to their essay.Richard Low as Poh Huat: MediaCorp actor Richard Low had a role in one of the MediaCorp productions that was filming during the time Singapore Dreaming was set to film. However, he was not engaged as his character in that production was in coma. In the film, Poh Huat is the patriarch of the Loh family. He persistently favours and sides with his son, Seng over his daughter, Mei. Like the rest of the family, he yearns for a better life and, in particular, for a car and a country club membership. Alice Lim as Siew Luan: Alice Lim was one of the actresses that were cast later. She is the first female MC for major events in Singapore, and used to be active in the 1970s. The directors admired her 'beautiful' delivery of Hokkien in the film. In the film, Siew Luan married Poh Huat when she was young and remained a housewife ever since. She is seen to brew bottles of herbal tea perpetually (for members of the family, who, except for Irene, tend to reject them). She shares part of her life story with the audience as the film concludes. Serene Chen as Irene: The producers had a good relationship with Serene Chen from their previous work together on an earlier production, 3Meals. They planned to cast Serene Chen early on, during the initial script-writing. In the film, Serene plays the live-in fiancée of Seng, Irene. Irene is deeply attached to Seng and hankers for a marriage with him in the beginning of the film. She, together with Poh Huat, funded his overseas studies. Irene is also very close to Siew Luan. Yeo Yann Yann as Mei: Although the producers were unacquainted with Yann Yann, they used her face as a reference when writing for the character, Mei. Back in Singapore, Yann Yann accepted their offer to cast as Mei. In the film, Mei is the underappreciated daughter of the family, married to CK, whom she occasionally henpecks. Indignant that Seng was sent overseas when she was the one whose academic performance was more distinguished, she bears a patent grudge against Seng. Lim Yu-Beng as CK: The part of CK was written for Lim Yu-Beng, who agreed to join the film's production. In the film, CK resigned as an army officer and turned to selling insurance, a career at which he does not appear to be successful. Dick Su as Seng: Dick Su was involved in the production only after Serene Chen brought him in. In the film, Seng is the son in the family, who failed in graduating from his overseas studies. There were times when he tries to convince his family, especially his father, that he can succeed in life. Unfortunately, his plans never seem to work out and he ends up disappointing the people around him.DevelopmentConceptionThe development of Singapore Dreaming began in 2000 when New York-based couple Colin Goh and Woo Yen Yen wrote an essay for Singaporeans Exposed, a publication to commemorate the Singapore International Foundation's ten-year anniversary. The 5200-word essay, Paved with Good Intentions, explained the difference between the Singapore Dream and the Singapore Plan, and discussed the source and fashion of many Singaporeans' aspirations.Paved with Good Intentions was later circulated round the Internet, where many Singaporeans read the essay.Confessional responses the couple received thereafter reached the hundreds. In a podcast with mrbrown, Woo explained the typical reader response was 'How is it that I now have a house, I now have a car, a job, why I am still unhappy?' The couple 'felt a responsibility to do something', which inspired them to write the film, the original working title of which was The 5Cs.ProductionThe film was a number of firsts in the film industry; Singapore Dreaming was the first Singaporean film to be digitally encoded and projected. It was also the first collaboration between Singaporean and New York film-makers; the Director of photography Martina Radwan, editor Rachel Kittner and sound designer Paul Hsu were based in New York, along with the production staff, while composer Sydney Tan was based in Singapore.Singapore Dreaming was an independent, low-budget production, costing only S800 000 in total to produce — 80", "machine_text": "Singapore Dreaming is a critically acclaimed film that was produced in Singapore and released in 2006. Additionally, the movie was selected to be presented at numerous international film festivals, including the Cannes Film Festival and the Toronto International Film Festival. The film was praised for its authentic representation of Singaporean culture and the challenges faced by Singaporeans in a fast-paced, modern and commercially driven society. The plot of Singapore Dreaming centers around an ordinary Singaporean family known as the Lohs. The family comprises a father, mother, daughter, and son, who all have dreams and aspirations of their own, but must navigate the realities of daily life in a society that demands an unwavering focus on financial success. The character arcs in the film portray the struggle of the Loh family to reconcile their personal passions and ambitions with the harsh practicalities of living in a highly competitive city-state that prioritizes materialism above all else. The film's screenplay was written by a pair of award-winning filmmakers in the form of Boo Junfeng and Tan Bee Thiam. The duo sought to create a narrative that explores the contemporary Singaporean experience while paying homage to the country's cultural heritage. Singapore Dreaming offers a rare glimpse into the struggles of ordinary Singaporeans who are often overlooked in the media-dominated imagery of the country's shiny modernization. The film has garnered positive reviews from critics worldwide, hailed as a refreshing take on an often-glossed-over social issue. Singapore Dreaming is a masterful work of filmmaking that has been widely appreciated for its insightful examination of the Singaporean psyche and the complex family dynamics that characterise the city's society.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 8294126}

However, in both sexes the body color is quite variable and often olive-green, beige and sepia-brown color variations occur. A yellowish line runs from the lower edge of the pronotum to the abdomen end. Two bright longitudinal lines run along the back sides.The back of the head is black. The form of the pronotum is rather smooth and gently concave and resembles a saddle (the Latin name ephippium means 'saddle of a horse'). They have round small atrophied wings, protruding a few millimeters below the pronotum, that are unfit to flight and only used for the emission of sounds (stridulation). In the females the ovipositor is long and slightly curved upwards. In the male cerci stand out clearly and are cylindrical and relatively long.Biology Adults can be found from July to October. The larvae go through about 5 stages. These bush crickets are omnivorous.

Found primarily in the Mediterranean region, the mole cricket has a distinct physical appearance and distinctive way of life. Appearance: The mole cricket has a unique appearance that allows it to blend in with its surroundings. Its wings are reduced to small pads, which it uses for balance while burrowing. It has large, spade-like front legs with shovels on the ends that are used for digging. Its body is brown in color and covered in tiny hairs. Habitat and Life cycle: The mole cricket lives in a variety of soil types, but it prefers sandy soil where it can easily dig and burrow. They can be found in open fields, gardens, meadows, and even in vineyards. They feed on plants, roots, and invertebrates. The male mole crickets can be heard chirping during the breeding season. They produce a sound by rubbing their front wings together. The female lays about 60 eggs in underground tunnels, which hatch into tiny nymphs. The mole cricket undergoes incomplete metamorphosis, which means that they have three stages: egg, nymph, and adult. Role in the ecosystem: The mole cricket plays a significant role in the ecosystem's food chain. They are a source of food for birds and other animals, and they also help to aerate the soil, which promotes plant growth. However, they can also do significant damage to crops and gardens by uprooting plants and eating the roots. Conclusion: Overall, the mole cricket is an intriguing species that is fascinating in both appearance and behavior. While they can be a nuisance to gardeners and farmers, they also have played an essential role in maintaining balanced ecosystems for centuries.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 62159083}

It is currently in the main sequence phase of its evolution, where it is fusing hydrogen into helium in its core. The two stars orbit around a common center of mass once every 42.2 years. The separation between the two stars varies from about 7 astronomical units (AU) to 43 AU at different points in their orbit. The star system was first discovered by the German astronomer Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve in 1825. Since then, various methods have been used to study the system, including astrometry, photometry, and spectroscopy. There have also been studies on the potential habitability of any exoplanets that might orbit either of the stars. However, no planets have been confirmed to exist in the system so far. Overall, the 16 Aquarii binary star system serves as an interesting object of study for astronomers, providing insight into the evolution and dynamics of star systems, as well as the potential for finding habitable exoplanets.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2902801}

The Bosnian TO was gained control by the Bosnian-Serb SDS in the coalition government. On 19 December 1990 Alija Izetbegović and the SDA party alarmed by the SDS's secessionists attitudes discussed forming an independent Bosnian army later Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In March 1991 Sefer Halilović formed the Patriotic League (Patriotska Liga - PL) as an independent Bosnian army, with the same territorial organization as the TO.It was in early 1992 that the JNA, Bosnian-Serb and Serbian paramilitary militias began attacking Bosnian-Muslim and Bosnian-Croat towns and villages the first ones being Sarajevo by the JNA and Bijeljina by paramilitary forces. On 4 April, Alija Izetbegović ordered general mobilization: and on 8 April he transformed the Sarajevo TO command into GHQ of the Teritorijalna Odbrana Republike Bosne i Hercegovine (Territorial Defence Force of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina) (TORBIH), appointing the Bosnian-Muslim Colonel Hasan Efendić as commander of the army, Colonel Stjepan Šiber, a Bosnian-Croat, became chief-of-staff, and Colonel Jovan Divjak, a Bosnian-Serb, his deputy. The TO was formally established on 15 April when all Patriotic League units joined the force. On 20 May 1992 the TORBIH, PL, and other militias and the Bosnian-Croat HVO and HOS were officially united as Armed Forces of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina (Oruzane Snage Republike Bosne i Hercegovine). On 23 May Colonel Efendić was replaced as commander by Sefer Halilović.Army of the Republic of Bosnia and HerzegovinaOn 20 May 1992 the TORBIH was renamed Armija Republike Bosne i Hercegovine (Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina) - ARBIH, usually abbreviated ABIH. In November 1993, Sefer Halilović was replaced as commander of ABIH by Rasim Delić.Organization 1992–1994The ARBIH, now around 80,000 strong was reorganized on 18 August 1992 into a more conventional structure. Initially four corps were created: 1st Corps (Sarajevo); 2nd Corps (Tuzla) in northern Bosnia; 3rd Corps (Zenica) and 4th Corps (Mostar) in Herzegovina; the Eastern Bosnian Operational Group in the eastern enclaves of Goražde. 5th Corps (Bihać) was established on 21 October 1992 from the Una-Sana Operational Group to defend the North-Western Bosnian enclave. The 7th Corps (Travnik) was established on 7 April 1994 with brigades from the 3rd Corps to advance north-westward through southern Bosnia. The 6th Corps (Konjic) was formed in June 1993 from the 4th Corps Northern Herzegovina Operational Group, to occupy northern Hercegovina from the HVO and eventually reach the Adriatic coast.Each corps controlled a number of brigades, independent battalions and companies. Brigades were designed as infantry, mountain, motorized or light and given new three digit numbers, the first number indicating the corps. The larger corps (1st, 2nd and 3rd) comprised 15 Operationa Groups, each with 3–7 brigades. From August 1992 to December 1994 about 105 brigades were formed or reformed in the 1-527 series: 48 infantry or undesigned, 41 mountain, 10 motorized and 6 light, but not all brigades existed at the same time. There were also single commando and reconnaissance, Military Police battalions and artillery brigades: the various independent units included the Delta SF Unit, four commando detachments, six Corps HQ MP battalions, a mixed artillery battalion and an independent armoured company. Eight Bosnian-Croat HVO units were incorporated into the ABIH. Crni Labudovi was a PL unit formed in April 1992 from refugees in Konjic under the 4th Corps (later 1st Corps), they eventually numbered 800 men and earned a reputation for battlefield bravery.Some PL units after the absorption by the TORBIH still operated independently. PL personnel wore 'Green Berets' as did many ABIH units. The ABIH assigned 15 mixed aircraft to corps HQs to supply 5th corps in Bihac and 2nd corps in the Goražde, Srebrenica and Žepa area. The Bosnian Police (Policija Republike Bosne i Hercegovine) were formed in 1992 from districts under Bosnian control and there was a Bosnian Special Police Unit (specijalna jedinica). There were no naval forces.Organization 1995 In January 1995 the ARBIH now expanded to 200,000 reorganized. The Operational Groups in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 7th Corps were redesigned as divisions, each division comprising 3–6 brigades, but the 4th and 5th Corps kept their brigades and structure. It was a much improved fighting force.CommandersApril 1992 – May 1992 TORBIH GHQ, Sarajevo Colonel Hasan Efendić (Commander of the TO RBiH) Colonel Jovan Divjak (Deputy Commander) Colonel Stjepan Šiber (Chief of Staff)May 1992 – November 1993 ARBIH GHQ, Sarajevo Alija Izetbegović (Commander-in-chief of the ARBIH) General Sefer Halilović (Chief of Staff of the Main Staff; Commander of ARBIH) General Stjepan Šiber (Deputy Commander of Main Staff) General Jovan Divjak (Chief of Staff)November 1993 – December 1995 ARBIH GHQ, Sarajevo Alija Izetbegović (Commander-in-chief of the ARBIH) General Rasim Delić (Commander of Main/General Staff; Commander of ARBIH) General Enver Hadžihasanović (Chief of Staff of the Main/General Staff) General Jovan Divjak (Deputy Commander, responsible for all matters concerning civilians)Equipment In 1995 the ARBIH had about 40 tanks, 30 APCs.See alsoBosnian WarArmy of Republic of Bosnia and HerzegovinaRepublic of Bosnia and HerzegovinaReferencesArmy of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina Army Bosnia and Herzegovina", "machine_text": "The Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) was the military force established by the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina during the Bosnian War from 1992 to 1995. The army was primarily composed of Bosniak (Bosnian Muslim) soldiers, with smaller numbers of Croats and Serbs joining later on. The ARBiH was formed in the early days of the Bosnian War, when Bosnia and Herzegovina declared its independence from Yugoslavia. The army was initially unorganized and poorly equipped, but it quickly grew in size and strength as the war dragged on. By 1994, the ARBiH was estimated to have around 100,000 soldiers. The ARBiH was involved in many major battles throughout the war. One of its earliest victories was the defense of the town of Srebrenica against Serbian forces in 1992. The army also played a key role in breaking the Serbian siege of Sarajevo in 1995. Throughout the war, the ARBiH faced many challenges, including a lack of weapons and resources, infighting between different factions, and the involvement of foreign fighters on all sides. The army also faced accusations of war crimes, particularly against Bosnian Serb civilians. Following the signing of the Dayton Agreement in 1995, which ended the Bosnian War, the ARBiH was formally disbanded and replaced by the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Many former members of the ARBiH went on to join the new army, and some military units and equipment were transferred over as well. Today, the ARBiH is remembered as a symbol of Bosnian resistance during the war. Its soldiers and commanders are celebrated as heroes by many Bosniaks, and the army is often held up as an example of the courage and determination of the Bosnian people during their struggle for independence. However, the legacy of the ARBiH remains controversial and divisive, with many Serbs and Croats still viewing the army as a source of fear and trauma.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 13700475}

He began his artistic training at the Verona Academy under Giovanni Caliari, and then studied at the Venice Academy from 1845 to 1847. An admirer of Giuseppe Mazzini, he became associated with the Young Italy movement and was taken prisoner while participating in the defense of Bologna in 1848. After his release he lived in Venice from 1849 until 1853.During the 1850sCabianca became acquainted with the artists, including Adriano Cecioni, Cristiano Banti, and Telemaco Signorini, who frequented the Caffè Michelangiolo in Florence, who would be known as the Macchiaioli. He became a friend of Signorini, and travelled with Signorini and Banti to Paris. His friend's influence led Cabianca to turn away fromgenre paintings towards a bolder realism, beginning in 1858. Like the other Macchiaioli, he painted landscapes en plein air, but he was more reluctant than his friends were to abandon historical and literary subjects.Cabianca emphasized powerful value contrasts in his paintings. Cecioni described him as 'the most declared, violent and uninhibited macchiaiolo.' Angelo de Gubernatis, who termed the Macchiaioli 'enemies of all conventionalism and accurate researchers of effects', described Cabianca as principally interested in the effects of sunlight. Gottardo Garollo in his Dizionario Biografico describes Cabianca as a painter of the 'effects of the Sun'.Many of his paintings depict nuns; a well-known example is Le monachine (The nuns; 1861–62, Turin exhibition). Other works of the 1860s include La Mandriana and il Porcile al sole (1860). Returning from travels to Tuscany and Paris in 1864, he domiciled in Parma from 1864 to 1868, then moved to Rome.Among his other works are Il bagno fra gli scogli; Sant'Angelo all' Isola di Giudecca; Reminiscenze del mare; Gondola bruna; La neve in Ciociaria; Le mura del convento; and Sotto il portico dei barattieri a Venice. At Naples in 1877, he exhibited Piccola via presso Perugia; La neve; Una casa ad Anacapri; and Reminiscenze d'Amalfi. At Rome in 1883 he displayed Rocca di Papa; Il caligo a Venice; Sul far del giorno; La pace del Chiostro; and Una sera sulla laguna.He also painted in watercolors, including La neve a Venice, Il fait sa cour, and Sulla marina di Viareggio.The works of Cabianca's later years show the influence of the Symbolists and the Pre-Raphaelites. He died in Rome on March 21, 1902.Collections holding works by Vincenzo Cabianca include the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna, Rome, and the Brooklyn Museum.Selected paintingsReferencesFurther reading Broude, Norma (1987).

He was born in Verona, Italy and began his artistic career as a student of Antonio Bresciani, a local painter. Cabianca was a prominent figure in the Italian art scene during his time, not only for his paintings but also for his involvement in the cultural and political movements of the period. He was a member of the group called 'Scapigliatura' ('The Disheveled'), a movement of artists and writers who sought to break free from the constraints of academic art and literature. Cabianca's style was characterized by a preference for dark colors and bold brushstrokes, which were used to create a sense of dramatic mood in his paintings. He also excelled in portrait work, capturing the emotions and personalities of his subjects with great skill. One of Cabianca's most famous works is 'The Last Days of Napoleon', which depicts the emperor's exile on the island of Saint Helena. The painting was displayed at the International Exposition of Paris in 1878 and received critical acclaim, cementing Cabianca's reputation as a master of historical painting. In addition to his artistic pursuits, Cabianca was also involved in the political and social issues of his time. He was a supporter of the Risorgimento movement, which aimed to unify Italy under a single government, and was involved in the movement for women's rights. Cabianca's legacy in the Italian art scene can still be felt today, as his works continue to be displayed in museums and collections throughout Italy and the world.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Monroe piercing\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "A Monroe piercing is a lip piercing placed off-center, above the upper lip on the left-hand side and is meant to resemble Marilyn Monroe's beauty spot, although Monroe's beauty spot was on her cheek, not her lip. The Madonna piercing is similar but worn on the right-hand side.Description This piercing is typically fitted with a 14, 16, or 18 gauge labret barbell, the bars of which are usually shortened after healing.A variation on this piercing are angel bites, with both the Madonna and Monroe style piercings worn on either side of the upper lip. This piercing may also be referred to as a Crayfish, Angel Bites, or Anti Bites, being the anti version of snake bites. When long barbells are worn in this piercing, they look similar to the antennae on a crayfish, hence the name. Most people with a Monroe piercing favor a metal ball or a jewel on the outer-end. The lip can often swell considerably after the piercing and will need both facial and oral aftercare to keep both sides of the jewelry clean at all times. Monroes, like all piercings, are prone to infection and it is vital that the piercing is cleaned regularly. Scarring is minimal to none if properly taken care of.Health impacts An advantage of a monroe piercing is that the lip area generally heals faster than other piercings.The estimated healing time given by professional piercers for this type of lip piercing is between 8–12 weeks, but many find it heals in 3–6 weeks.The monroe can be a very painful piercing process, as this area of the body contains a large system of nerves. There is a small risk of piercing the superior labial artery, which lies just above the upper lip.The amount of pain experienced during the piercing process differs from person to person and depends on the specific location of the piercing. Those with thicker lips or well-exercised facial muscles will have more flesh or muscle to pierce, so they may experience more discomfort. Men may experience slightly more pain than women, as repeated shaving can make the skin of the upper lip tougher and harder to pierce. The orbicularis oris (the sphincter muscle around the mouth) is used in the playing of brass and woodwind instruments; as a result, players of these instruments tend to have a larger muscle around the mouth and may experience more discomfort during the piercing process.As with similar piercings, monroes can cause long-term damage to the gums and teeth. The back-disk of metal jewellery worn in this piercing rubs against them, potentially resulting in gum recession or damage to tooth enamel. Plastic labret-studs are available to minimize this problem.ReferencesFacial piercings Marilyn Monroe Madonna (entertainer) de:Labret-Piercing#Madonna-Piercing", "machine_text": "Monroe Piercing Monroe piercing is a type of facial piercing that is named after Marilyn Monroe for her iconic beauty mark. This piercing is a popular fashion trend that is placed on the left side of the upper lip, just above the lip line. It is a subtle way of enhancing the beauty of the face while also adding a touch of individuality and personal style. The Monroe piercing is typically done with a needle and a small piece of jewelry that can vary in shape, size, and material. Most commonly, a small stud or a ball is used in the piercing, but other options, such as hoops or gemstones, are also available. Healing time for Monroe piercing takes about 6 to 12 weeks depending on the aftercare of the piercing. The procedure of Monroe piercing is generally performed by an experienced piercer who uses sterile instruments, proper hygiene, and techniques to minimize any discomfort. It is important to choose a reputable piercing studio or artist and to follow proper aftercare instructions to avoid any potential risks, such as infection, rejection, or migration. Monroe piercing has become a popular trend among both men and women, and it is frequently seen in alternative fashion subcultures. This piercing is a great choice for those who want a subtle, yet stylish touch to their appearance and can be worn alone or paired with other facial piercings. However, it is important to consider the structure of your own face when getting a Monroe piercing because the placement may vary slightly depending on individual facial anatomy. In conclusion, Monroe piercing is a trendy and unique way to enhance one's personal style while also making a subtle statement. It is important to find a qualified piercer, follow proper aftercare, and be mindful of individual facial anatomy when deciding to get a Monroe piercing.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 5578644}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"The Amalgamut\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Amalgamut is the third studio album by American rock band Filter, released on July 30, 2002 by Reprise Records. Unlike their first two albums Short Bus (1995) and Title of Record (1999), which were both certified platinum, the album stalled prior to hitting 100,000 copies sold, in part due to frontman Richard Patrick cancelling its main tour in order to enter a rehab facility. The album still had two singles released in its promotion: 'Where Do We Go from Here' and 'American Cliché'. The Amalgamut was the last album to feature band members Geno Lenardo, Frank Cavanagh, and Steve Gillis, with Patrick starting up the band Army of Anyone upon getting out of rehab. It was the last Filter album to be released until six years later, when Patrick reformed the band with new members and released 2008's Anthems for the Damned.Background In 1995, Filter found great success with their debut album Short Bus, which went platinum in the United States, based on the strength of their single 'Hey Man, Nice Shot'. However, many complications arose upon attempting to create a follow-up in the late 1990s. The first album had been written and recorded by the band's two sole members frontman Richard Patrick and band member Brian Liesegang. When the two attempted to record a follow-up, they found they had wanted to take the band in different directions; Liesesgang wanted to go into a more electronic direction, whereas Patrick wanted to pursue a more rock-oriented direction. Liesegang eventually left, leaving Patrick as the sole member of the band. He attempted to create an album by himself with producer Rae Dileo, but after some unsuccessful sessions, Patrick decided he did not want to create an album alone, and proceeded to attempt to recruit Short Bus touring members Geno Lenardo, Frank Cavanaugh, and Matt Walker. Lenardo and Cavanaugh joined up, but Walker had temporarily joined The Smashing Pumpkins, so they recruited a new drummer, Steven Gillis.Despite many complications and an extended four-year wait between albums, the band managed to find success once again, as the follow-up, Title of Record, went platinum, largely off of the success of the band's single 'Take a Picture'. The band, feeling pressure from the record label to maintain this momentum, and without any of the hurdles that prevented progress in the last album cycle, commenced work on a third album.Writing and themes Inspiration and influences for the creation process was largely influenced by three main factors. The first was a 2 month cross-country road trip Patrick took prior to recording. Patrick found himself disgusted with the commercialization and homogenization of American culture, stating that he found himself '...sick and tired of seeing McDonald's, Burger King, Subway, on every single street.' The reaction even led to the naming of the album; with The Amalgamut being a neologism of a portmanteau of 'amalgam' and 'gamut', with Patrick feeling that ultimately there should be 'more focus on abstract thought and individualism, as opposed to everybody trying to be the same.' Conversely, Patrick stated the album title had more positive connotations as well, with Patrick stating that he saw, through interacting with actual people, that America was, in fact, a melting pot of different races and origins, and that the term Amalgamut was also 'a celebration of freedom'.Secondly, Patrick was influenced by worldly issues, especially violence, towards the turn of the century. 'The Missing', while technically written prior to the 9/11 Attacks, became all the more meaningful to Patrick after said events, as it captured many of his emotions and reactions to it. The track 'Columind' was written in response to the Columbine High School massacre, where as 'American Cliché' was more of a response to 'how commonplace school violence has become'.Thirdly, the writing sessions were affected by Patrick's struggles with addiction, concerning alcohol, cigarettes, and drugs. While Patrick had struggled with it in the past, it became particularly bad upon dealing with the pressure of recording a follow-up to the platinum selling Title of Record. Patrick would stay up for multiple days at a time without sleep, spending entire days indulging in his addictions instead of working on the album. The album's first single, 'Where Do We Go From Here' addressed said struggles; the track was self-referential in Patrick's struggles to create the album in the face of his addiction, knowing that the money being spent in the prolonged period, and the drugs being taken, were not sustainable activities. The track 'God Damn Me' was written in between Patrick's blackouts one night when he was so heavily intoxictated that a friend kept on stopping in to wake him up to make sure he was still alive. In 2013, Patrick would reflect on the writing sessions, stating 'I went through a music phase where I was writing as I experienced my life within drugs and alcohol....I cringe when I hear some of it because a lot of the lyrics I feel like ugh what was I thinking. There's a lot of stuff I would have changed if I had been a little bit more clear headed.'Recording and production The recording sessions were prolonged and extensive due to many complications, many stemming from Patrick's struggle's with addiction. Patrick recalled 'almost being in tears' after recording vocals for the track 'Where Do We Go From Here', as he was typically smoking three to four packs of cigarettes a day, making it difficult for him to hit his higher notes, and even breathe at times. Delays also occurred upon Patrick breaking his wrist after completing a new song, celebrating it, and then slipping and falling on the ice while refusing to go to the hospital. Patrick was still able to play guitar, though his movements were limited. Patrick also would lash out at others, ranging from insulting members of the band's official messageboard for posts he didn't approve of, leading to its ultimate removal, and temporarily kicking band members out of the studio to work on music alone. As such, progress was continually delayed; with Patrick's timetable for a release date shifting from June 2001, to July 2001, to early 2002, to 'mid to late summer'.In recording the album, the band worked with music producers Ben Grosse and Rae DiLeo, both of which they had worked with on Title of Record. Patrick aimed to make the album 'more metallic and mainstream' than Title of Record. The heavier songs were recorded in 'drop A' and 'drop D' guitar tunings. The band entered the final phases of recording the album in December 2001, with plans to start mixing the album at the beginning of 2002. In March 2002, the band released a tentative track list that ultimately containing all of the tracks that would be make the final album, albeit with an alternate order, and 'The 4th' going by the tentative title 'Reservation'. Other tentative names for tracks during the recording process included 'I Like the World Today' for the track 'World Today' and 'It Feels Like You're With Me and Against Me' for 'The Only Way is the Wrong Way'. The album entered the mixing stage, done by Grosse, and mastering phase, done by Bob Ludwig in April 2002, and was fully completed by the end of the month, after 18 months of recording, but pushed back to mid-2002 by the record label.Unreleased material Patrick has alluded to several songs that were not released on the album's final release. In January 2001, he alluded to the song title 'It Will Always Remain In My Head'. In October 2001, Patrick alluded to a song by the title 'Don't Give an Inch', which he described as sounding similar to past Filter tracks 'Stuck in Here' and 'Take a Picture'. He stated the track's lyrics were about not being afraid of who he was, and'kind of a message to all people to focus on being an individual, and less on being a spoke in a wheel.' In 2010, Patrick revealed that the track 'Drug Boy', off of their 2010 release The Trouble With Angels had actually been written in the Amalgamut sessions.Release, promotion, and aftermath After some minor shuffling around with the release date from August 6,to July 23, to July 30, The Amalgamut was finally released on July 30, 2002. The album's release was preceded by the first single, 'Where Do We Go from Here', released on June 20. The album saw initial success, with the album charting at no. 32 on the Billboard 200 charts, only two place below their prior album, Title of Record. Additionally, 'Where Do We Go From Here' charted on several music charts, including no. 11 on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks, no. 12 on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks, and no. 94 on the all-format Billboard Hot 100 chart. Prior to touring in support of the album, Patrick and Lenardo recruited a second guitarist, Alan Bailey, as a live member, to fully flesh out the band's sound for live shows. The band played live shows promoting the album in the five weeks leading up to the album's release. However, shortly after, the band would lose momentum. The band was able to perform a handful of headlining concerts around the time of the album's release, and made an appearance on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, to play the track 'My Long Walk to Jail', but on the eve of September 30, just before starting up a major tour to promote the album, Patrick cancelled all tour dates in order to enter drug rehabilitation. Additionally, prior to entering, Patrick indicated that music piracy may have hurt the album's sales, with him stating that figures showed that the album had been downloaded illegally at least 80,000 times in its first month, which is more than the album's official sales, which only amounted to 76,000 copies sold in the same timeframe. A second single, 'American Cliché', was later released, but failed to leave much of a mark, only charting at no. 40 on the Mainstream Rock chart. The track appeared on the game ATV Offroad Fury 2. The song 'The Only Way (Is the Wrong Way)' was later licensed for use in a Hummer commercial, something Patrick later remarked was used to help finance his rehab. The track was later released on the Tomb Raider: Cradle of Life film soundtrack as well.While Patrick's initial announcement was that he hoped the touring would resume in 2003, these plans never surfaced. With band members gone and pressure from the record label, he forwent his touring plans in lieu of entering the recording studio to record another album. Patrick enlisted the help of Stone Temple Pilots members Robert DeLeo and Dean DeLeo to work on the album, but upon their writing and jam sessions, Patrick opted to start a new band with them instead, called Army of Anyone. This pushed off any further activity from Filter until 2008, when Patrick recorded and released a follow-up called Anthems for the Damned, largely by himself but with some from guest appearances and drummer Josh Freese.Critical receptionThe album has commonly been considered a critical and commercial flop, although review aggregator Metacritic assigned the album a score of 68 out of 100, based on eight reviews, indicating 'generally favorable reviews'. Allmusic critic Don Kline praised the album for offering 'the album cleverly incorporates the best of what Short Bus and Title of Record each had to offer', and ultimately concluded that 'the resulting sound is that of an updated and improved Filter, with The Amalgamut proving that there's much more to the band than 'Hey Man, Nice Shot.' Ben Mitchell of Blender thought that the record adheres to the blueprint laid down by the breakthrough power ballad 'Take a Picture', while also featuring heavier tracks. Mitchell further wrote: 'The ballads are for dough, and damned catchy they are, too.' Entertainment Weeklys Robert Cherry, who remarked the mixture of 'skyscraping melodies, tonsil-shredding screams, electronic textures, and acoustic and metal guitars', stated: 'Richard Patrick's unfocused lyrics don't offer much insight into the album's reported subject: America's cultural diversity. But the music is more honed than ever.'Matt Ashare of Spin thought that the best tracks on The Amalgamut 'sweep ringing, acoustic-guitar verses into anthemic power-chord choruses', while concluding that 'the only tradition Filter answers to is that of consummate rock professionalism.' In a negative review, Andrew Shaffer of The Huffington Post criticized the album for being 'a mess mirroring Patrick's own downward spiral into drug and alcohol abuse.' Rolling Stone critic Barry Walters criticized the heavier tracks of The Amalgamut for weighing the record down; nevertheless, Walters praised the 'standout' track 'The Only Way (Is the Wrong Way)', further stating: 'If Filter can repeatedly attain such pure beauty, why can't they elsewhere filter out their own sludge?'Track listingPersonnelCredits per Allmusic, unless otherwise sourced.BandRichard Patrick – lead vocals, guitar, programming, drum loop on 'World Today'Geno Lenardo– guitar, bass, programmingFrank Cavanaugh - bassSteven Gillis– drumsProductionBen Grosse – production, engineer, mix engineerRae DiLeo– production, engineer, digital editingJeff Mol– assistant engineerDarrell Thorpe– assistant engineerChuck Bailey– assistant engineerRick Behrens– assistant engineerBlumpy - digital editingBob Ludwig – masteringChart positionsAlbumSinglesReferences2002 albums Filter (band) albums Reprise Records albums Albums produced by Richard Patrick", "machine_text": "The Amalgamut is the fifth studio album by American nu-metal band Filter, released on July 30, 2002. The album was produced by Ben Grosse, who had previously worked with bands like Marilyn Manson and Smashing Pumpkins. The Amalgamut features a departure from the electronic sound of the band's previous album, Title of Record, and leans more towards heavy, guitar-driven music. The Amalgamut received generally positive reviews from music critics, who praised the album's heavy sound and political themes. The album reached #25 on the US Billboard 200 chart, and spawned the hit single 'Where Do We Go from Here'. The album also includes a cover of Harry Nilsson's song 'One', which was released as a single and featured in the film The Exorcist: The Beginning. The album's political themes are evident in tracks like 'The Missing', which criticizes the government's response to the 9/11 attacks, and 'American Cliché', which skewers American culture and consumerism. The album also deals with personal themes, such as addiction ('Columind'), divorce ('Drowning'), and depression ('So I Quit'). Filter's frontman Richard Patrick has described The Amalgamut as the band's most personal and politically charged album. In an interview with Billboard, he said, 'The Amalgamut is the sound of two men who were genuinely freaked out by the state of the world, and by their own personal lives. It's a very dense and heavy record, with a lot of layers and a lot of emotion.' Despite its heavy themes, The Amalgamut is also known for its catchy hooks and energetic performances.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"2nd Massachusetts Cavalry Regiment\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The 2nd Massachusetts Volunteer Cavalry Regiment was a regiment of cavalry troops in the Union army during the American Civil War. It consisted primarily of men from the states of California and Massachusetts, and served in the Eastern Theater, despite its western roots.History Politicians at the start of the Civil War began raising volunteer troops in response to President Abraham Lincoln's call to arms to force the return of the Confederate States of America to the Union. Owing to political divisions at the time of the Civil War and to the limited transportation facilities for moving troops great distances, the Lincoln administration did not request California troops for Eastern battlefields but instead called for volunteers to replace regular troops stationed at western garrisons. In the late summer of 1862, a small number of men in California who had been raised in the East decided to enlist in the army, but wanted to serve in the Eastern Theater. They contacted Governor John Andrew of Massachusetts in the late summer of 1862 and offered to raise a company of 100 cavalrymen to serve in a state regiment. Andrews agreed on the condition the Californians would provide their own uniforms and equipment and pay for their own passage to Boston.The so-called 'California Hundred' was organized in San Francisco on December 10, 1862, and took a ship to the East Coast, arriving at Camp Meigs in Readville, Massachusetts, on January 4, 1863. They were designated as Company A, and soon were joined by seven companies of Massachusetts. The Californians and four of the local companies were moved in mid-February to Baltimore, Maryland, then to Fort Monroe and numerous other locations in Virginia, where they primarily engaged in picketing, scouting, and outpost duty until July 1863. Commanded by James Sewall Reed, the Californians first took to the field near Yorktown, Virginia. From July 1863 to July 1864, the California Hundred engaged in numerous skirmishes with John S. Mosby's Confederate partisan rangers in the Loudoun Valley.In February and March 1863, another 400 Californians were recruited and sent to Massachusetts to form Companies E, F, L, and M (the 'California Battalion') of the 2nd Massachusetts Cavalry. They arrived in the Bay State on April 16, 1863, completing the full complement of the regiment. They moved to Washington, D.C., in May and Colonel Charles Russell Lowell was given command.In August 1863, the regiment was combined in Centreville, Virginia, and became a part of King's Division in the XXII Corps. They later served in the Army of the Shenandoah under Philip H. Sheridan during the Valley Campaigns of 1864. Among the many actions that the 2nd Massachusetts Cavalry participated in were the battles of Fort Stevens, Opequon, Tom's Brook, and Cedar Creek. The following spring in 1865, by now under command of Colonel Caspar Crowninshield, it participated in the Siege of Petersburg. In the subsequent Appomattox Campaign it pursued elements of the retreating Army of Northern Virginia, then marched in the Grand Review of the Armies in Washington on May 23. The men were mustered out July 20, 1865, at Fairfax Court House, Virginia, before returning to California and Massachusetts in the weeks that followed.The regiment lost during its service 8 officers and 82 enlisted men killed and mortally wounded, and 3 officers and 138 enlisted men by disease for a total of 231. Of the original California Hundred's 3 officers and 101 enlisted men, 40 were present the day the company disbanded. About 12 had died, others were discharged because of sickness or wounds or were transferred to other units, and 10 deserted, a greater desertion rate than from any other Massachusetts regiment.Two men of the regiment were awarded the Medal of Honor for gallantry in the Valley Campaigns of 1864.

As a member of the royal family, Princess Euncheon received a classical education and was fluent in Chinese, Japanese, and English. She was known for her beauty and grace, and was often called upon to represent the Korean royal family at official functions. In 1919, Princess Euncheon married Kim Yun-sik, a prominent Korean independence activist. The couple had four children and remained devoted to each other throughout their lives. During the Japanese occupation of Korea, Princess Euncheon and her family were forced to live in exile in China. Despite the difficult circumstances, Princess Euncheon continued to work for the Korean independence movement, using her position and influence to raise awareness of the cause. After the liberation of Korea in 1945, Princess Euncheon returned to her homeland and resumed her duties as a member of the royal family. She remained an active participant in the Korean community until her death in 1971. Today, Princess Euncheon is remembered as a symbol of Korean resilience and determination in the face of adversity.

The village was established in the early medieval period, and its name comes from the Old English for 'South Wynn's place', indicating that it was once the home of a landowner named Wynn. South Wonston was listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as being owned by the Bishopric of Winchester, and remained an important ecclesiastical centre throughout the Middle Ages. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, South Wonston developed into an important market town, with a number of shops and businesses catering to the needs of the wider area. However, the growth of nearby Winchester and the decline of agriculture led to a decline in the fortunes of the village, and it became more of a dormitory community for commuters travelling to Winchester and beyond. Today, South Wonston is a thriving village that is home to a number of local amenities, including a modern primary school, a pub, a village hall and a number of shops and businesses.

The team plays its home matches at Cownie Sports Complex on the south side of Des Moines, Iowa and is coached by Scotsman Gareth Smith.History The Drake program began in 1986. Under coach Bob Wood, the Bulldogs would compile a 16–16 record over two seasons as an independent before joining the Big Central Soccer Conference for the 1988 season. After a three-year run in the BCSC saw Drake post a collective 29–25–4 record (8–7–3 in conference), the Bulldogs would join their traditional sporting conference, the Missouri Valley Conference, for the 1991 season.Upon joining the MVC, the Bulldogs went 6–10–0 (1–2–0) in 1991 season and 6–12–2 (2–2–1) in 1992. The Bulldogs would bounce back to post three consecutive winning seasons for the first time in school history from 1993 to 1995 (including a record-best 4–2–0 mark in 1994 MVC play). During his final seasons, Wood's teams totaled a combined 14–21–1 record in 1996–1997.For the 1998 season, Drake hired Swiss-born Canadian, 32-year-old Evansville assistant Sean Holmes. In 1998, the Bulldogs earned a 6–11–1 mark. In 1999, Drake went 4–13–1 (1–5–1).For the 2003 season, the Bulldogs moved from the larger Drake Stadium into the more-intimate off-campus Cownie Sports Complex, and Holmes began to turn the program around, guiding the Bulldogs to a 4th-place finish in the conference, good enough to host a quarterfinal match in the conference tournament. The 2003 squad achieved the first top 25 ranking in the program's history. The 2004 squad would begin the season ranked for the first time in school history, and the 2005 season saw victories over three ranked opponents, including a win over then-sixteenth-ranked Creighton for the first time in school history.In 2008, Holmes' Drake squad had a breakout season. Drake would win a school-record 13 matches (against 5 losses and 1 draw) and earned an NCAA Tournament berth for the first time. Drawn into the Queens, New York region of the bracket, the Bulldogs would battle hard at Saint Louis before falling on a goal just 4.1 seconds away from penalty kicks.The 2009 season saw Holmes' team take the program to new heights. Hosting the Missouri Valley Conference tournament after finishing second in the regular season, the Bulldogs edged third-seeded Creighton, 2–1, before defeating fourth-seeded Evansville, 2–1, to win the school's first-ever conference tournament title and clinching their second consecutive College Cup appearance. In the tournament, the Bulldogs would earn their first-ever NCAA victory with a 2–1 win over Western Illinois and then stunned fourth-seeded Ohio State 1–0 to advance to the Sweet 16 In the Sweet 16, after falling behind 2–0, the Bulldogs rallied to a stunning 6–4 win at Boston College before falling in a 2–1 heartbreaker to No. 5 North Carolina in the national quarterfinals.Hours before the start of the 2015 season, Drake announced that assistant Gareth Smith would replace 17-year head coach Holmes to become interim head coach. Smith was promoted to head coach after Drake finished 3rd in the MVC regular season. The 3rd seeded Bulldogs then won three consecutive matches in the conference tournament to earn the conference's automatic bid to the 2015 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championship.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"West Haven station\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "West Haven station is a commuter rail station on the Metro-North Railroad's New Haven Line, located in West Haven, Connecticut.The station was built on Sawmill Road between Hood Terrace and Railroad Avenue, in the Elm Street-Wagner Place neighborhood. West Haven has 660 parking spaces in on-site lots (with the possibility of 300–400 more in a parking garage in a refurbished industrial building north of the station if warranted by future demand) as well as bicycle facilities. The station is accessible. West Haven has full service on the New Haven Line, as well as from the handful of Shore Line East trains which run past New Haven to Stamford.After a decade of studies, planning, and controversy over the station site, ground was broken for the station on November 10, 2010.The 80 million project included the station, with two 12-car platforms, a glass station building, and an overhead pedestrian bridge, as well as the restoration of the formerly abandoned fourth mainline track through the station. It is only the second new station on the line in a century, afterin 2011. The station opened to passengers on August 18, 2013.Shore Line East service at the station was suspended indefinitely on March 16, 2020, due to the coronavirus pandemic.HistoryOriginal stationsDuring the 19th and early 20th centuries, a station stop was located in West Haven between Washington and Campbell Avenues, abouteast of the modern station. The first West Haven station, at Washington Avenue, opened along with the rest of the New York and New Haven Railroad on December 25, 1848. The wood-framed building, located on the south (eastbound) side of the tracks, was moved west halfway to Campbell Avenue in 1895 when the line was quadruple-tracked. At that time, a second station was built on the westbound side across from the older station. The first station burned down on February 26, 1914, and was replaced by a new building by the middle of 1915. As trains grew longer and heavier, closely spaced village stops were retired in favor of more widely spaced downtown stations. West Haven closed in the mid-1920s, though the eastbound station building was not demolished until the 1940s. The station was briefly proposed to reopen in the 1950s following the construction of a Veterans Affairs hospital nearby; however, this did not come to fruition, and the idea was largely abandoned for several decades.A short-lived station was also located at Front Avenue in West Haven on the New Haven and Derby Railroad. The station was at street level, with stairs to the platform on the elevated tracks. The station opened in 1871 and was closed by 1914.Planning for a new station In the late 1990s, Metro-North began considering adding a station in either West Haven or neighboring Orange to fill thegap between theandstations—the longest such gap on the New Haven mainline. Both town governments were supportive of a station, which was then to cost25–30 million. Support in West Haven was largely rallied by the West Haven Train Station Committee Inc., which circulated a petition eventually signed by 7600 residents. Support in Orange was both local by the Orange Railroad Committee and also aided by several employers, including Bayer Pharmaceuticals, whose employees were likely to use the station. In fall 2001, a site study and a regional transportation committee recommended the Orange site (at Marsh Hill Road) based on cost, time considerations, and highway access. However, in December 2001, the South Central Council of Governments voted instead to support the West Haven site, citing the economic needs of West Haven versus comparatively wealthy Orange.Orange's first selectman originally planned to appeal the decision, and controversy continued. The sustained bitter animosity between the two towns was cited in a study of bargaining between municipalities. The Final Environmental Impact Statement, issued in June 2007, considered both station sites, noting that 'The recommendation of the West Haven site does not preclude the construction of a commuter railroad station at the Orange site in the future, as the demand for additional parking and service warrants, and as additional funding becomes available.' In 2011 - even after ground was broken at West Haven - state lawmakers considered a funding deal to build an Orange station.Design and fundingIn February 2005, the City of West Haven released a proposal for the West Haven station that modified the state's current plan, with less land taking adjacent to the station and a pedestrian bridge across Saw Mill Road to a 629-space garage in the Armonstrong North building. The city's proposal also included transit-oriented development, with a 325-unit residential development on the Armstrong South property and mixed-use buildings along Hood Terrace and Railroad Avenue. On June 19, 2006, West Haven Mayor John M. Picard and U.S. Representative Rosa L. DeLauro announced that DeLauro had secured 1.2 million in federal funding for the project, which brought the federal funding commitment as of that date to3.2 million. The Final Environmental Impact Statement, released in June 2007, estimated the capital cost for the station at 66.56 million including land acquisitions, with a total of 1,074 parking spaces split between lots and a garage.

In 1946 his parents immigrated to Armenia from Greece. They were exiled to the Altai region of Siberia from 1949 to 1955. His brother, Artur Veranian, is a conductor.From 1965 to 1970 Veranian studied at Yerevan's Martiros Saryan Art School. Works of his childhood are in the permanent exhibition at the Armenian Museum of Children's Art.In 1979 he graduated in Industrial Design, Graphic Design and Painting from the Yerevan State Academy of Fine Arts. Later he destroyed all his paintings from this early period. In 1981 Veranian became a member of the Artists' Union of USSR.Veranian married actress Nora Badalian in Yerevan on 29 November 1981; they have a daughter and son. From 1981 to 1991, Veranian was the head of the Graphics Department, National Center of Aesthetics of Armenia (NCA). In November 1981, he had his first show at the Artists' Union of Armenia and then at the Modern Art Museum, Yerevan (MAMY).In 1991 his work Migration (tales of the Aegean Sea, sheet 02 and 03) was acquired by the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts, Moscow. Known in art circles, Veranian was largely unknown by the public until he appeared on Armenian TV in 1997, after the XLVII Venice Biennale International Exhibition of Art. In the Armenian Pavilion there Veranian exhibited his Untitled (model fresco) installation. In 1999 Veranian was the commissioner and curator of An Inter-Cultural Space project by the artist Narek Avetisian in the Armenian Pavilion at the XLVIII Venice Biennale International Exhibition of Art.Veranian was the artistic director (1998 to 1999) of Printinfo and the artistic director (1999 to 2002) of the Armenian Center for Contemporary Experimental Art (ACCEA).In 2002 Veranian and Badalian cofounded Yerevan Scope, a tourist handbook of Yerevan and Armenia.WorkPaintingVeranian's early abstract works include Garni (1983), Cilicia 01 (1984) and Cilicia 02 (1986). These works show the influence of Armenian ancient art. He exhibited Cilicia 02 in the Central Exhibition Hall Manege, Moscow, in 1986. Soviet art critic and art historian Aleksandr Kamensky wrote 'Veranian is very talented. He has a wonderful sense of color, but this road leads to nowhere' in the Literaturnaya Gazeta (Literary Newspaper).Veranian has focused on painting over the past few years, starting with the painting series Arrow of Apollo (2008–2011), Bactrian princesses (2008–2012), Moisture of Light (2012–2013), Uneatable fox (2012–2013), Arctic Ocean Library (2009–2014) and Orchestral Satan (2014), Alpine Sniper (2014), Ink-Eraser (2012–2013), Live to Tell (2012–2013) and Adventuress (2011–2014).His Zenon archive (2008–2011) was shown at the Antikyan Gallery in 2011. The Windows of Mr.Arabian, Silk Mercers (2012–2014) are at the artist's studio. Veranian is regarded as one of the most important representatives of a generation of Armenian artists who distanced themselves from Abstract Expressionism. Art critic Alain Navarra-Navassartian wrote 'If Stepan Veranian creates topography of the identity and interiority he does it by creating images of 'places'. The abstraction of its space is transformed into historical topography.”InstallationsAn exhibition of nine artists, '9' (1992), held at MAMY, served as the spring-board for several projects in the following years, leading to the creation of the Armenian Center for Contemporary Experimental Art (ACCEA). Veranian has created a number of installation art pieces including a glass balloon. With an expanded group of artists, an exhibition entitled Cuckoo Clacked (1992), and Identification (1993) were held at MAMY. Church (1994), devoted to the artist's grandfather Stepan Hovhannes, who was a priest in the Armenian Apostolic Church in Athens, consisted of dust, steam heating pipes and graffiti on the floor. This installation has been exhibited at MAMY. Corpus Hermeticum (1995) included green glass vintage wine jugs with hand print engravings inside, and graffiti on the floor. Zeazea Beazea, Sibyl, Metamorphoses (1996) was a collection of perfumery accessories and jars of cream, women's jewelry, jewelry boxes, combs, etc.- a drama of an aging beautiful woman. B2 Stealth Bomber, Buried Cities (1996) was a triangular shape on the concrete floor with a striped track. Later he displayed a smaller installation work, called Why Not, the Violet Silk Petticoats (1996) which consisted of а yarn for the knitting.In October 1996, the Ministry of Culture and Monument Protection of Georgia invited Veranian to the inaugural exhibition of the International Art Biennale of Tbilisi.Opus et setera (1998) consisted of the reconstructed model of a medieval merchant ship, traditional Lake Sevan sailing boats, and a bright neon installation drawing of the Wind Rose on the concrete floor. Executed town was exhibited in ewz, Zurich-Unterwerk Selnau, Kultur und Eventhaus (2007). Alain Navarra-Navassartian, art critic and curator of the exhibition wrote 'By these objects strewn on terra cotta, creates a biography of places, the various accounts of the work acquire part of their mythical value and their historical relevance because they are anchored in concrete details, they have points of reference which one can see or visit. It is a question of orchestrating the power of imagination by locating it in a universal history but through imaginary topography. It is thanks to the reciprocal bonds between these common images that the social framework of our collective memory and formed.'The installation Space Shuttle, Donkey and Barbie Life was made from 2012 to 2014.Paper works of artVeranian, known primarily as a painter and installation artist, has also done printmaking. He considers his drawings to be a very intimate means of expression. His favorite subjects are the female form, and the nude figure. The unique drawing technique, involved in making of the drawings, is perfectly suited to immediate expression, as is Veranian's aristocratic drawing style.PrintmakingSince 1981 Stepan Veranian has made etchings, aquatints and linocuts. Veranian fully embraced linocuts, during the period spent working in the Graphics Department, National Center of Aesthetics of Armenia. The National Gallery of Armenia and MAMY have bought his prints. The thirteen Blue Prints of 1985 were made with linocut and painting. Veranian created a key series of 21 large scale linocuts in 1989, influenced by Federico García Lorca's poems. Other prints include the Composition and Dreams (1989) series, consisting of 13 linocuts. This series of linocuts was displayed for the first time in September 1990 at MAMY, as part of a group exhibition. The Migration (tales of the Aegean Sea, sheet 02 and 03, the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts, Moscow), a series of 21 etchings, was created between 1989 and 1991. In May 1995, he created a number of etchings, inspired by his public and private life, for an exhibition called Moscow-Yerevan, Question of the Ark at MAMY.TheaterVeranian has designed covers for novels.

Born on October 22, 1890, in Boston, Massachusetts, Veranian demonstrated his passion for music from an early age. After he graduated from high school, Veranian enrolled in the New England Conservatory of Music, receiving his degree in 1909. Veranian began his career as a composer and conductor in the Boston area. He conducted the Boston Pops orchestra for several years and premiered several of his own compositions with them. In 1923, Veranian moved to New York City, where he worked for a number of publishing companies and also conducted the New York Philharmonic. He wrote several pieces of music for popular films in the 1930s and 1940s, including the score for the film 'Lost Horizon.' In addition to his work as a composer and conductor, Veranian was also an accomplished pianist. He often performed his own compositions when he conducted orchestras and gave recitals throughout the United States and Europe. Veranian’s works were highly acclaimed for their depth and complexity, infusing elements of both classical and contemporary music. Veranian’s most notable achievement was the creation of the Armenian National Anthem, which he wrote in 1918. The anthem has become a symbol of Armenian pride and resilience, and it is still played at official events to this day. Despite his impactful career, Veranian’s name has largely faded from cultural memory. However, his contributions to the world of music and Armenian culture live on through his works, which continue to be performed and listened to by generations of music enthusiasts.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 44260642}

It is on the China—Kyrgyzstan—Kazakhstan tripoint, east of lake Issyk Kul.Its geologic elevation is , but its glacial icecap rises to . For this reason, in mountaineering circles, including for the Soviet Snow Leopard award criteria, it is considered a 7,000-metre peak.Khan Tengri is the second-highest mountain in the Tian Shan, surpassed only by Jengish Chokusu (means 'Victory peak', formerly known as Peak Pobeda) (7,439 m). Khan Tengri is the highest point in Kazakhstan and the third-highest peak in Kyrgyzstan, after Jengish Chokusu (7,439m) and Avicenna Peak (7,134 m). It is also the world's most northern 7,000-metre peak, notable because peaks of high latitude have a shorter climbing season, generally more severe weather and thinner air.Names The name 'Khan Tengri' literally means 'King Heaven' in Kazakh or 'King Sky' in Mongolian and possibly references the deity Tengri. In some other local languages, it is known as Khan Tangiri Shyngy, Kan-Too Chokusu, Pik Khan-Tengry, and Hantengri Feng. (, , Han Táńiri, حان تأڭئرئ;Han-Teñiri, حان-تەڭىرى; ; , Xiao'erjing: هًا تٍْ قْ لِ فعْ). Local residents named the mountain Khan-Tengri for the unique beauty of snow giants.Features Khan Tengri is a massive marble pyramid, covered in snow and ice. At sunset the marble glows red, giving it the name 'blood mountain' in Kazakh and Kyrgyz (; ). Located just across the South Engilchek (or Inylchek) glacier, 16 km north of Jengish Chokusu, Khan Tengri was originally thought to be the highest peak in the Tian Shan because of its dramatic, steep shape, compared to the massive bulk of Jengish Chokusu. This perception was probably also due to Khan Tengri's visibility across the plains of southern Kazakhstan while Jengish Chokusu remains out of view of civilization. Khan Tengri is the highest peak in the rugged Tengri Tag subrange, also known as the Mustag, that also contains Chapaev Peak () and Gorky Peak (). Anatoli Boukreev considered Khan Tengri perhaps the world's most beautiful peak because of its geometric ridges and its symmetry.History Although it is almost 430 m (1,500 ft) lower than its neighbor, Khan Tengri was believed to be the highest peak in the range until Jengish Chokusu was surveyed in 1943 and determined to be higher.Peter Semenov was the first European to see the Tengri Tag and its peak, the colossal Khan Tengri (in 1857).The first ascent of the peak was made in 1931 by ’s Ukrainian team through a route from the south (Kyrgyzstan side), then along the west ridge. M. Kuzmin's team made the first ascent from the north (Kazakhstan side) in 1964. Khan Tengri is one of five peaks that a Soviet mountaineer needed to scale to earn the prestigious Snow Leopard award.Anatoli Boukreev achieved the first solo speed ascent in 1990.A team from Kazakhstan made the first winter ascent of Khan Tengri on February 7, 1992; the team included Valery Khrichtchatyi, Viktor Dedi, Yuri Moiseyev, Valdimir Suviga, Aleksandr Savin, Igor Putintsev and Malik Ismetov.Austrian mountaineer and expedition leader Toni Dürnberger died while descending after having climbed Khan Tengri on 17 August 1992.In 2004, more than a dozen mountaineers were killed in a large avalanche on the Pogrebetsky route, the most popular route on the mountain.The peak appears on the Kyrgyz 100 som bill.See alsoList of elevation extremes by countryFootnotesExternal linksKhan Tengri route mapsInternational Mountaineering Camp Kan TengriMountains of China Mountains of Kazakhstan Mountains of Kyrgyzstan Issyk-Kul Region Landforms of Almaty Region Kazakhstan–Kyrgyzstan border International mountains of Asia Seven-thousanders of the Tian Shan China–Kazakhstan border China–Kyrgyzstan border Border tripoints Highest points of countries Tengriism", "machine_text": "Khan Tengri is a mountain peak located in the Central Asian region of the Tian Shan mountain range.

Khan Tengri is located on the Kyrgyzstan-Kazakhstan border, with its northern face lying in Kazakhstan and its southern face in Kyrgyzstan. The mountain is known for its striking beauty, with its sharp peak rising above vast snowfields and glaciers. It is also known for its challenging climbing routes, with the first successful ascent of the peak not taking place until 1931 by a Soviet team led by M. Pogrebetsky. Khan Tengri is considered one of the most beautiful and challenging peaks in the world, attracting many mountaineers every year. The peak presents a variety of climbing challenges, including steep ridges, icefalls, and a large ice cap that covers its highest slopes. The peak is climbed from the north side in Kazakhstan and from the south side in Kyrgyzstan. The peak has been the subject of various cultural and mythological interpretations by local people. It was traditionally seen as a sacred site by the Kazakhs and the Kyrgyz, who believed it was the dwelling place of spirits and deities. The peak has also been the subject of many legends and tales in Central Asian folklore, with some stories claiming that its summit was the gateway to the heavens. Today, Khan Tengri is a popular destination for adventure travelers and mountaineers from all over the world.

It is the most distinguished part of the Hellenic Police. It was formed in 1978 when two counter-terrorist units were created within the two police divisions that existed then (Hellenic Gendarmerie and the Cities Police), which were united into a single body in 1984, the Hellenic Police. In the beginning the Unit had only 150 men, but when Greece became the host country of the 2004 Summer Olympics their number increased to 200 after reassessing the needs for the magnitude of the event.TrainingThe EKAM force is based in Athens, but have several detachments spread throughout Greece's major cities. Each officer is a full-time member who must have at least five years on the force before being allowed to try out. Many receive training from the Greek Army's Ranger School before going on to the police counter-terrorism school.The Special Suppressive Antiterrorist Unit of the Hellenic Police follows a three-month training program every year. For its training modern, purpose-built facilities are being used. Training can also take place in other locations such as buildings in urban or rural areas (inhabited or not), the Athens International Airport, planes of Olympic Airways, the Piraeus port infrastructure, the Hellenic Railroad system, the Athens Metro. Other places that have been decided as suitable to cover its training needs can also be used. The Unit is in constant cooperation with other Special Units abroad such as the FBI, SAS and ERU via the ATLAS Network.OperationsThe Special Suppressive Antiterrorist Unit of the Hellenic Police, operates all around Greece and abroad whenever is deemed necessary. It has confronted challenges such as hostage situations and it has contributed in the arrests of many dangerous criminals. The EKAM played a key role in the dismantling of the November 17 and Revolutionary People's Struggle terrorist organizations. In March 2003, it confronted successfully an incident on a Turkish Aeroplane which was hijacked while it flew from Istanbul to Ankara (flight no. 160) and ended up at the Athens International Airport at the order of the hijacker.

They are also required to undergo regular training to maintain their skills and keep up with changing terrorist tactics. EKAM operates under the direction of the Greek Police Headquarters and works closely with other law enforcement agencies in Greece, as well as with international partners. The unit has been involved in a number of high-profile operations, including the response to the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris. EKAM is also involved in training other law enforcement agencies in Greece and around the world in antiterrorism tactics. The unit has trained police officers in countries including Cyprus, Iraq, and the United Arab Emirates.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Persecution of Biharis in Bangladesh\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Bihari Muslim minority in Bangladesh were subject to persecution during and after the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War (called the Civil War in Pakistan), experiencing widespread discrimination. Biharis were ethnic Urdu-speakers and largely maintained a pro-Pakistani stance, supported the Pakistan Armed Forces and opposed the independence of Bangladesh and the Bengali Language Movement. Biharis faced reprisals from mukti Bahini and militias and from 500,000 to 550,000 were killed.Bihari representatives claim a figure of 600,000 Biharis killed.The Supreme Court of Bangladesh ruled Biharis eligible for Bangladesh citizenship in 1972, but about 500,000 chose repatriation to Pakistan. Some repatriation was implemented by the Red Cross over a number of years, but in 1978 the Pakistani government stripped Pakistanis remaining in Bangladesh of Pakistani citizenship. Researchers (such as Sumit Sen) maintain that the Pakistani government's denationalisation of the Biharis and reluctance to rehabilitate them in Pakistan are sufficient evidence of persecution to warrant refugee status. The Biharis have also faced institutionalised discrimination linked to their citizenship status, and many live in squalor in refugee camps.HistoryPartition violence Bihar (now a state in eastern India) was plagued by communal violence between Muslims and Hindus due to partition, along with the other former territories of British India. More than 30,000 Biharis were killed in October and November 1946, and it is estimated that up to one million migrated to East Pakistan. In the aftermath of the 1946 riot in Bihar, Jinnah said 'I never dreamt that in my lifetime I shall see Pakistan in being, but the tragedy of Bihar has brought it about'. The Muslim League organised the rehabilitation of the Bihari refugees in Sindh. The arrival of Bihari refugees in camps in Sindh and Bengal in 1946 paralleled the later movement of refugees in 1947.Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (then a student leader) toured affected villages in Bihar with his relief team, and was moved to ask Bihari refugees to move to East Bengal in 1947.Migration from BiharThe 1947 partition of India displaced between 11.6 and 18 million people; millions of Muslims migrated from India to Pakistan while millions of Hindus and Sikhs migrated from Pakistan to India. Adherents of the two-nation theory believe that in addition to Pakistan, Muslims should have an independent homeland in Muslim-majority areas of India; this sparked the mass Muslim migration to the Dominion of Pakistan. According to the 1951 census, 671,000 refugees were in East Bengal; by 1961, the refugee population had reached 850,000. Broad estimates suggest that about 1.5 million Muslims migrated from West Bengal and Bihar to East Bengal in the two decades after partition.BackgroundOne reason cited for communal violence between Biharis and Bengalis was Bengali opposition to Urdu as a national language, which resulted in the Bengali Language Movement and an economic downturn. The relatively secular attitude of East Pakistan increased tensions between the two communities and the two provinces of the country. In the 1970 general elections Biharis predominantly supported the mostly West Pakistani Muslim League over the Awami League (overwhelmingly supported by Bengalis), and played an active anti-secessionist role in the liberation war.Biharis supported the Pakistan Armed Forces during the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War, comprising majorities in armed paramilitary groups such as Al-Shams, Razakars and Al-Badr (held responsible for the genocidal campaign against Bengali nationalists, civilians, religious and ethnic minorities). News outlets such as the BBC have published death-toll estimates by independent researchers varying from 200,000 to 500,000. Scholars such as R. J. Rummel and Matthew White estimate the total Bengali civilian death toll at 1.5 million. The casualty figure estimated by Pakistan is 25,000, as reported by the Hamoodur Rahman Commission.Having generated unrest among Bengalis, Biharis became the target of retaliation. The Minorities at Risk project puts the number of Biharis killed during the war at 1,000; however, R. J. Rummel cites a 'likely' figure of 150,000.Another cause of Bengali reprisal could be the collaboration of Biharis with the Pakistan Army, which participated in mass rape of Bengalis during the Bangladesh Liberation War.Susan Brownmiller has estimated the number of rape victims of the Pakistan Army and its collaborators during the war at 200,000 to 400,000 women and children.Many scholars have used such events to understate, marginalize and even justify atrocities against non-Bengalis or to suppress the memory of atrocities committed against them.EventsIn early March 1971, 300 Biharis were killed by Bengali mobs in Chittagong. The massacre was used by the Pakistan Army as a justification to launch Operation Searchlight against the Bengali nationalist movement. Biharis were massacred in Jessore, Panchabibi and Khulna (where, in March 1972, 300 to 1,000 Biharis were killed and their bodies thrown into a nearby river).The magnitude of anti-Bihari attacks by Bengalis throughout the war are contested. Bengali sources admit the death of a few thousand to 30,000 or 40,000 non-Bengalis. According to a white paper released by the Pakistani government, the Awami League killed 64,000 Biharis and West Pakistanis. R. J. Rummel, a historian with the University of Hawaii, gives a range of 50,000 to 500,000 Biharis killed and concludes at a prudent figure of 150,000 murdered by Bengalis overall. International estimates vary from 20,000 to 200,000. In June 1971, Bihari representatives put forward a figure of 500,000 Biharis killed by Bengalis.AftermathMukti BahiniAllegations have been made that Mukti Bahini, the Bengali resistance force, backed by Indian government, from East Pakistan, killed non-Bengalis (primarily West Pakistanis and Bihari) in the aftermath of the Bangladesh Liberation War. Sarmila Bose, in her book Dead Reckoning: Memories of the 1971 Bangladesh War, accused Bangladeshi liberation accounts of ignoring atrocities against Urdu-speaking people in East Pakistan. However, Bose's book is considered controversial, and is laced with historical innacuricies and obfuscations. Her book was highly criticized by many historians, journalists and the writers.Refugee crisisThe Bangladesh government announced Presidential Order 149 in 1972, offering citizenship to Biharis. According to government sources 600,000 Biharis accepted the offer, and 539,669 opted to return to Pakistan. But according to historian Partha Ghosh approximately 470,000 Biharis out of a total of 700,000 Biharis opted to be repatriated to Pakistan through the International Red Cross. Several groups in Pakistan have urged their government to accept the Biharis.Surur Hoda, a Socialist leader, played an active role in solving the refugee crisis. He organized a delegation, headed by British Labour Party politician David Ennals and Ben Whitaker, which encouraged many refugees to return to Pakistan. In a 1974 agreement, Pakistan accepted 170,000 Bihari refugees; however, the repatriation process has since stalled.Organisations such as Refugees International have urged both governments to 'grant citizenship to the hundreds of thousands of people who remain without effective nationality'. During his 2002 trip to Bangladesh, Pakistan president Pervez Musharraf said he sympathised with the plight of the Biharis but could not allow them to emigrate to Pakistan. As of 2006, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) had not addressed the plight of the Biharis. On 19 May 2008, the Dhaka High Court approved citizenship and voting rights for about 150,000 refugees who were minors at the time of Bangladesh's 1971 war of independence. Those born in the country since the war also gained citizenship and the right to vote.ImmigrationDue to their initial pro-Pakistan stance, the Biharis were consistent in their wish to be repatriated to Pakistan. Initially, 83,000 Biharis (58,000 former civil servants and military personnel), members of divided families and 25,000 hardship cases were evacuated to Pakistan. By 1974, 108,000 had been transferred to Pakistan (mainly by air); by 1981, about 163,000. Both countries have signed agreements on the repatriation of stateless people, but only a few hundred have managed to go to Pakistan. Under the supervision of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees over 119,000 Biharis were airlifted to Pakistan. By 1982 Pakistan had received 169,000 Biharis. Some Biharis also entered Pakistan through illegal means. According to the UNHCR report 170,000 Biharis were repatriated after the second Delhi Agreement. In 1977, 4,790 families were repatriated; 2,800 in 1979; 7,000 in 1981; 6,000 in 1984; and 50 families in 1993. A total of approximately 178,069 Biharis were repatriated to Pakistan between 1973 and 1993.In 1988, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) raised about 500 million for the repatriation and rehabilitation of Biharis to Pakistan. A special committee, the Rabita (Coordination) Trust Board, was formed by Pakistan President Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq. It received14 million in 1992, and was requesting additional donations from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states for the rehabilitation of Biharis.Land allocated to Biharis in Pakistan in one colony in Mian Channu is now a slum. The Biharis were targeted by the ethnic Sindhi people during the 1980sKarachi riots. In the Punjab province of Pakistan, ethnic Punjabis forcefully occupied shelters allocated to the Biharis.These incidentshave prompted some Biharis to return to Bangladesh.Present conditionsAlthough many Biharis have assimilated into the Bengali population of Bangladesh, some opt to migrate to Pakistan and arerelocated to refugee camps across Bangladesh. According to one estimate, at least 250,000 Biharis are still inBangladesh urban refugee camps. The camps have become slums, the largest of which (known as 'Geneva Camp', with over 25,000 people) is crowded and undeveloped; families up to 10 people typically live in a single room, one latrine is shared by 90 families and no more than five percent of the population has a formal education. Due to the lack of educational opportunity and poor living conditions, young men in the slums have set up an Urdu Bhashi Jubo Chhatro Shongothon (Urdu-Speaking Young Students Association) to increase educational opportunities in their community. Health and sanitation problems persist due to poor drainage and sewage systems, and the economic condition of Bihari refugees has been described in news reports and academic journals as extremely poor.2014 Kalshi clashes In 2014, members of the ruling Awami League, aided by police clashed with the members of the Urdu speaking community, in a bid to grab land, in Mirpur. During these clashes, nine people including eight members of a family were burnt alive by Awami League and their local Bengali supporters.The Biharis blamed the attacks being directed by Elias Mollah, the ethnic Bengali lawmaker of Mirpur. Elias Mollah denied involvement and blamed a 'vested conspiracy' against him.Citizenship and reconciliation effortsIn May 2003, a high court ruling in Bangladesh allowed ten Bihari refugees to obtain citizenship and voting rights. The ruling exposed a generation gap among Biharis; younger Biharis tended to be 'elated', but many older people felt 'despair at the enthusiasm' of the younger generation and said their true home was in Pakistan. Many Biharis now seek greater civil rights and citizenship in Bangladesh.On 19 May 2008, the Dhaka High Court approved citizenship and voting rights for about 150,000 refugees who were minors at the time of Bangladesh's 1971 war of independence. Those born in the country since the war also gained citizenship and the right to vote. Several political parties campaigned in the camps for the Bihari vote during the 2008 general election, and the group was considered important to parties and candidates. Although the court ruling explicitly said that the Biharis are eligible to register to vote in the December 2008 elections, the Election Commission closed its rolls in August 2008 without enrolling them.See also1971 Bangladesh genocideAnti-Bihari sentimentHuman rights in BangladeshStranded PakistanisReferencesFurther readingReport Hamoodur-Rahman CommissionAnti-Pakistan sentiment Bangladesh–Pakistan relations Ethnic cleansing in Asia Biharis Human rights abuses in Bangladesh Muhajir history Racism in Bangladesh Torture in Bangladesh", "machine_text": "Persecution of Biharis in Bangladesh refers to the systematic targeting of Bihari Muslims who migrated to East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) during the partition of India in 1947.

The Bihari community had migrated to East Pakistan during the partition of India, hoping to find a new home in what would be the state of Pakistan. However, they were seen as supporters of Pakistan during the 1971 war, leading to widespread violence and discrimination against them. Many Biharis were killed, raped, and tortured, and thousands were forced to flee to refugee camps in Pakistan. Despite the end of the war and the creation of Bangladesh, the Bihari community continued to face persecution and marginalization. They have been denied citizenship, legal recognition, and the right to education and employment. Many continue to live in squalid refugee camps with inadequate access to basic necessities like healthcare and food. In recent years, there have been some efforts to address the plight of the Bihari community. The government of Bangladesh has granted citizenship to some Biharis, and international organizations have advocated for their rights. However, many Biharis continue to live in desperate conditions and face ongoing discrimination and violence.

He was a right-handed batsman and a medium pace bowler.Early lifeWazir played in all the Tests that India played before the second world war. In the tour of England in 1932, he scored 1229 runs in first class matches and 1725 overall. In the next tour in 1936 he was hampered by a hand injury but recorded his highest score of 42 in the Test at Manchester.First class cricket Wazir was educated at Aligarh Muslim University. He made his first-class debut, aged 19, for Muslims against Sikhs at Lawrence Gardens (now Bagh-e-Jinnah), Lahore in the 1922-23 Lahore Tournament.For most of his first class career he played for Southern Punjab in the Ranji Trophy and Muslims in the Bombay Pentangular. His unbeaten 222 in the 1938/39 Ranji final against Bengal was then the highest in the tournament. Bengal had earlier been all out for 222, but Southern Punjab still ended up in the losing side. His career best score of 268 not out for Indian University Occasionals in 1935 was the highest score in Indian first class cricket. Both records were beaten by Vijay Hazare's undefeated 316 in 1939/40.As a cricketing figure, Wazir Ali was second only to C.K. Nayudu among his contemporary Indian cricketers but he apparently resented it having to play second fiddle to Nayudu. Nayudu had many rivals and Wazir was often a stalking-horse for them. Mihir Bose contrasted the two: 'To an extent Nayudu and Wazir Ali were natural rivals. Wazir, like Nayudu, was a powerful right-hand bat who could play some very elegant strokes including a charming cover drive, and he was also a more than useful medium-pace change bowler. Like Nayudu he played in only seven Tests, all against England, and did not have the opportunity to demonstrate his class or his ability to its full extent. What set the two men apart was that Wazir, eight years younger than Nayudu, did not possess the older man's determination and his obsession with the game. Nayudu was, undoubtedly the greater cricketer, and he left a deeper impression on the game … Wazir in contrast, died at the age of forty-six after an operation for appendicitis just three years after Pakistan was created, and he had little chance to impose his personality of the post-war game in that country.Wazir captained India in two unofficial Tests against an Australian XI in 1935/36. Nayudu had captained the side in the first two matches of the series and dropped out of the matches in which Wazir captained the side. 'Wazir went to his grave nursing a deep grievance against Nayudu', though it seems that Nayudu was genuinely unable to play.Later life After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, Wazir migrated to Pakistan and ended his life in poverty. Cashman quotes a Pakistani official that 'during his last days, Wazir lived precariously on his own meagre savings in a small quarters in Soldiers Bazar where he struggled against poverty and disease'.His son Khalid Wazir played two Tests for Pakistan in 1954. Wazir was the elder brother of Nazir Ali.ReferencesCited sources Mihir Bose (1990) A History of Indian Cricket, Andre Deutsch,External linksIndia Test cricketers 1903 births 1950 deaths Cricketers from Jalandhar Indian cricketers Muslims cricketers Southern Punjab cricketers Sindh cricketers Central India cricketers Patiala cricketers Northern India cricketers Indian emigrants to Pakistan", "machine_text": "Wazir Ali (1922–2003) was a prominent Pakistani squash player, who is widely regarded as one of the greatest players in the history of the sport.

Steele, which feature the landscape of Brown County, Indiana. The paintings are located on the Eskenazi Health campus, near downtown Indianapolis, Indiana, and are part of the Eskenazi Health Art Collection.DescriptionFour Seasons is a series of four oil on canvas murals - Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter - painted in 1914 by Indiana artist T.C. Steele, which feature the landscape of Brown County, Indiana. Often regarded as the 'pioneer of Indiana landscape paintings,' Steele, in his signature 'agreeable impressionistic style,' used color, light, and brushwork to capture the experience of each season in southern Indiana. In 1917, Alfred M. Brooks, in his article 'The Art and Work of Theodore Steele,' featured in The American Magazine of Art, wrote that the Four Seasons murals feature '...lovely echoes of light and shade, made to play over, and to accentuate, rather than conceal, the highly representative character of the details which make up the purely pictorial nature of the subjects, these 'Seasons' are masterly and, decoratively masterful. They bespeak the inherent bigness and breadth of the scenes they represent so faithfully.'Historical informationThe Four Seasons murals were created as part of the 1914 City Hospital Mural Project in Indianapolis, Indiana. In 1911, Indianapolis City Hospital expanded by adding two dedicated patient buildings, the Burdsal Units. St. Margaret’s Hospital Guild, a local women’s volunteer group dedicated to supporting the City Hospital, donated money for decoration of the new wards, which resulted in the world's first large-scale mural project in a public hospital. Sixteen of Indiana’s “finest and most promising” artists, including Steele, were invited to contribute to the mural project. Despite the limited budget, Steele and the other artists committed to completing the project for the wages of a union house painter, approximately 75–100 per month.While the majority of artists worked on-site at the hospital, Steele painted the Four Seasons murals at his home, 'The House of the Singing Winds,' in Brown County, Indiana. Because the canvases and frameworks were so large, and his existing studio could not accommodate the space required, Steele painted the murals in his living room. In late 1914, before they were installed in the hospital, the Four Seasons murals were exhibited at the Herron Art Institute. Upon arrival at City Hospital, the four canvases were mounted to patient ward walls using a mixture of white lead and damar varnish. Once hung, the adhesive was further secured by covering the completed murals with thick layers of varnish.ConservationIn 1967, imminent renovation plans for the Burdsal units endangered the mural collection. Through a campaign organized by St. Margaret's Hospital Guild, Steele's murals were slated for conservation by the James G. Snodgrass Studio. The four murals were removed from the building's walls, mounted to masonite, restored, and displayed at the Indiana State Museum. With building renovations complete, in 1976, three of Steele's murals - Spring, Summer, and Autumn - were returned to the hospital, where they hung in conference rooms. The fourth mural, Winter, was gifted to the museum as a gesture of gratitude for the works' safekeeping.LocationThe Four Seasons mural fragments were reunited with the 2013 opening of a new Sidney and Lois Eskenazi Hospital campus and are part of the Eskenazi Health Art Collection. Winter is on loan for 99 years from the Indiana State Museum. The Four Seasons mural fragments are located in The Rapp Family Conference Center: Steele Corridor on the first floor of the SidneyLois Eskenazi Hospital and are 'Dedicated with gratitude, The Penrod Society.”ArtistTheodore Clement Steele (1847-1926) was an Impressionist painter known for his portraits and Indiana landscape paintings. Born and raised in Indiana, he studied at the Royal Academy when he and his family moved to Munich in 1879. Steele returned to Indiana in 1885 and was part of a group of well-known Indiana artists, the Hoosier Group. Among others, Steele’s work is included at the Haan Mansion Museum of Indiana Art, Indiana State Museum, Indianapolis Museum of Art, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and the Indiana University Art Museum in Bloomington, Indiana.See alsoEskenazi Health Art CollectionSidneyLois Eskenazi HospitalReferencesExternal linksEskenazi Health Art Installations (video)Eskenazi Health Art Collection 1914 paintings", "machine_text": "Four Seasons is a collection of four murals painted by the renowned American artist, Alphonse Mucha. The murals depict four different seasons of the year - spring, summer, autumn, and winter. They were commissioned by a businessman named Charles Richard Crane, who planned to use them in a pavilion at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. The murals are a mix of Art Nouveau and Symbolist styles and are some of Mucha's earliest works. Each mural is created on a canvas measuring 6.5 meters high and 4.5 meters wide. The murals are rich in detail, and much attention has been paid to the nuances of each season. The Spring mural depicts a group of nymphs basking in the sunlight, surrounded by tulips, crocuses, and other spring flowers. The Summer mural showcases a scene of a woman with a sickle standing in a field of wheat, with the sun setting behind her. The Autumn mural depicts a woman picking grapes, surrounded by vineyards and the fruits of harvest. Finally, the Winter mural features a woman sitting in a snowy landscape with a bare tree behind her. After the World's Columbian Exposition, the murals were purchased by the Art Institute of Chicago, where they remain on display to this day. They have become some of the most popular and beloved artworks in the museum's collection. The Four Seasons murals are considered some of Mucha's most breathtaking works and exemplify the beauty and elegance of Art Nouveau.

In the late 1960s, the Johnstons retired from an advertising business in New York and founded the Moonhole community on the narrow western tip of the island.Tom and Gladys began building a house beneath the arch with the aid of local masons from the nearby village of Paget Farm. Using whalebones, native hardwoods, and objects recovered from the sea, they built large open rooms with sea views. Without wells or electricity, they collected rainwater from the roofs and stored it in cisterns for bathing and washing. The master bath had a large tree that grew right up through a large hole in the roof. Large windows facing the prevailing trade winds had plexiglass panes that could be lowered into place. The bedrooms surrounded a central dining room, veranda and large bar made from a humpback whale's jaw bone.In the early years there was not even a road to Moonhole. People from Paget Farm walked in daily to bring in fresh fruit and freshly baked bread and to do any necessary cooking.Tom and Gladdie later formed Moonhole Company Limited and contributed the approximatelyproperty to the company. Tom bequeathed his controlling interest in Moonhole Company Limited to a trust for the protection and preservation of Moonhole for posterity.The Thomas and Gladys Johnston Moonhole Conservation Trust Limited is dedicated to preserving the unique architecture, lifestyle, and vision of the Johnstons and to protecting the birds, wildlife and marine life on the peninsula at the western end of Bequia. There are now eleven privately owned homes at Moonhole and four houses owned by Moonhole Company Limited. Some of these properties are available for rent throughout the year.In 2004 the New York Times described Moonhole as 'a quirky 19-home ecologically oriented development built of native stone, with whalebone accents, on the steep hills of the island's southern tip. The name comes from a soaring natural arch on the shore through which the moon can be seen at times. The whalebones, remnants of aboriginal whaling by the islanders, are big enough to work as elements like stair railings. The houses, which rely on solar electricity, rainwater and propane tanks, are mostly fanciful open-air affairs with lines blurred between indoors and out.'ReferencesExternal linksMoonhole Company WebsiteSports Illustrated interviewNew York Times feature (2004)New York Times feature (1975) Du Jour Magazine (2013)Populated places in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Houses in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines", "machine_text": "Moonhole is a small, picturesque community located in the British Virgin Islands. The community is known for its unique architectural style that incorporates the natural rocks and boulders found on the island into the buildings, creating a seamless integration of man-made and natural structures. It is also home to a number of artists, writers, and musicians who have been drawn to its beauty and tranquility. The origins of Moonhole date back to the 1960s when a couple named Tom and Gladdie Johnston stumbled upon the area while sailing around the British Virgin Islands. The couple fell in love with the rugged beauty of the island and decided to build a home for themselves and their family there. Rather than clearing away the boulders and rocks on the property, the Johnstons decided to incorporate them into the design of their home. They hired an architect and a crew of local stonemasons to help them create a unique structure that would feel like a part of the natural landscape. The result was a stunning, multi-level home that seemed to grow out of the rocks and boulders on the property. The house featured winding staircases, open-air courtyards, and sweeping views of the ocean. The Johnstons named their home 'Moonhole' after the circular holes that dotted the boulders on the property, formed by natural erosion over time. Over the years, Moonhole has become a popular destination for tourists and travelers seeking a unique experience in the British Virgin Islands. Many of the homes in the area have been designed in the same style as the original Moonhole house, with natural rocks and boulders incorporated into the design. The community is also home to a number of artists and musicians, who draw inspiration from the natural beauty and serenity of the area.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Destiny Fulfilled\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Destiny Fulfilled is the fifth and final studio album by American RB trio Destiny's Child. It was released on November 16, 2004, by Columbia Records and Sony Urban Music. A comeback release, it marked the return of Destiny's Child after the group went into hiatus, which allowed each member to release solo albums. Unlike their previous material, this record saw each member equally contributing to the songwriting and production. Destiny's Child further worked with frequent collaborators such as Rockwilder, Swizz Beatz and Rodney Jerkins as well as several new producers.For the album's theme, the members drew inspiration from the conversations they had during the first week of recording when they discussed about the happenings in their lives while being apart. Composed mostly of mid-tempo songs and ballads that are subsequent continuations of each other, altogether telling one complete story, Destiny Fulfilled is an RB album. It was released to generally mixed reviews among music critics who criticized its mid-tempo ballads and lyrical content. The album was commercially successful; it reached number two on the US Billboard 200, and has since been certified triple Platinum in that region. It was also successful in different countries worldwide receiving certifications in Australia, Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom among others.As part of the album's promotion, the group performed songs from it on numerous award ceremonies and televised appearances in the US and Europe. They further embarked on the tour Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It in 2005 with 67 dates across four continents worldwide. Destiny Fulfilled spawned four singles—the lead single 'Lose My Breath', 'Soldier', 'Girl' and 'Cater 2 U'. After the tour, the group disbanded.BackgroundWhile recording their third studio album Survivor in late 2000, Beyoncé announced that Destiny's Child would eventually go on a hiatus that would allow each member to release a solo album, which they hoped would further increase interest in the group. The idea of solo releases emanated from the group's manager, Beyoncé's father, Mathew Knowles. Kelly Rowland further explained in an interview that Destiny's Child has been present in the media for a long time and they wanted to 'give the public eye a rest from DC for a minute'. During that same interview, she acknowledged that the trio would return to the studio in fall 2003 to start with the work on a new album.Two members of the group, Beyoncé and Rowland each released one album, while Michelle Williams released two. While each member achieved domestic success, Beyoncé's had been regarded as the most successful with the release of Dangerously in Love (2003), which enjoyed international commercial success and acclaim. This, along with their other ongoing projects, led to speculation over the disbandment of Destiny's Child. Amidst rumors and speculations, Rowland announced in 2004 their return to the studio to record what would become their fourth and final album. The group claimed that the reunion was destined to happen, and that their affinity to each other kept them together.After this album, the group planned to part ways after their fourteen-year career to facilitate their solo careers. Beyoncé has noted that their destinies were already fulfilled; however, Destiny's Child claimed that naming the album Destiny Fulfilled was not a coincidence. Beyoncé has said that 'the group felt it still had something to offer musically' with the album before adding: 'We did this record for ourselves, not to sell a million the first week out... That doesn't mean as much to us as just the fact that three friends got back together to do another record. That was our destiny.'. Rowland commented: 'We were like, 'You know what, we're getting older and we want to end on a high note.' We want to give our fans a great final record'. Beyoncé, also commented regarding the finality of their career: 'Who knows what will happen in three, five or 10 years? The main thing is that we maintain our friendship and that we do it because we want to – not because it's a good business move.'Production and recordingProduction of the album began in summer of 2004 with Destiny's Child taking help from frequent collaborators including Rockwilder, Swizz Beatz and Rodney Jerkins. The group worked on the album within a period of three weeks. Jerkins, who had worked with Beyoncé for her solo album Dangerously in Love, concerned how he would manage the production, saying, 'How is this going to work?' Cause Beyoncé, she blew up solo, so how's it going to work in a group together?'. He stated that once he got inside the studio, however, his skepticism vanished as he saw the group's 'excitement being back in the studio together', calling the process 'natural'. The members of the group stated that the first week of recording was spent solely on conversations about the happenings in their lives while being apart from each other as they hadn't spent quality time for a long period. This further inspired them to record the conversations and use it as the main theme of the record.Differing from Survivor in that previously Beyoncé had taken an active role in writing and producing, Destiny Fulfilled saw each member contributing inputs culled from personal experiences and individual opinions and points of view not dependent from the others'. In most cases, producers of the album would send them a CD containing a track that would be the group's basis in the songwriting process; without the producer's supervision of which part to sing, that formed a new direction of their style different from their previous records. The traditional approach where each member sang one verse and chimed in the chorus was replaced; in some songs in Destiny Fulfilled, their vocals were alternated in every line of the lyrics, a technique similar to hip hop artists. Destiny's Child took the role of executive producing alongside their manager, Mathew Knowles. Beyoncé, who vocally produced the songs, commented that it was important for her to make sure their voices were audible and identifiable. Taking it as one of her goals, the group decided to focus on mid-tempo songs and on few dance numbers and ballads—which they considered people cannot sing with. Beyoncé elaborated 'We wanted to make sure that the songs would be something that we were proud of 10 years from now, 20 years from now. We wanted it to be something that people can really feel an emotion to. Up-tempo songs can do that, but they more make you wanna dance.' As Rowland was recently engaged in the time of the writing of the album, it further influenced her songwriting. She also cited that being apart from the group affected the album as well: 'All of us have been in three different places ... so there's a lot to talk about, a lot that's gone on, personally. I think it's important to talk about that on this new record, to put what we've been going through separately into the new record.'CompositionDuring an interview with MTV, Beyoncé stated that the songs put altogether tell a complete story and noted that each song was a subsequent continuation to the next one. She concluded, '[The album continues with] this whole journey of this group of women trying to find love. And truly they find it because they love themselves and find it in themselves. It's friendship, it's love, it's maturity and growth, and it's everything that we wanted it to be.' For the music of the album, the group tried challenging themselves, working with different arrangements, trying to create an original sound; to succeed in this, they were influenced by The Emotions, Jodeci and SWV mixing elements of their music. Destiny Fulfilled is predominantly an RB concept album tracing a woman's relationship journey. Critics further found elements of soul music, dance and hip-hop. The album is mostly composed of mid and slowtempo balladry following the opening two songs; Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian felt that the ballads showcased 'the girliness in the trio, musically and lyrically'. Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine found elements of middle of the road music in the ballads.The album opens with the up-tempo dance song 'Lose My Breath', a track detailing a man full of empty promises to a woman. It is musically complete with military, marching-band drums and keyboard stabs and the backing track contains various sound effects. 'Soldier', the second track with T.I. and Lil Wayne, the only featured artists on the album, contains elements from Southern hip hop and CrunkB. Unsatisfied and unfulfilled with the lover from the opening song, the protagonists ask for a decent soldier, further singing about finding a gangster. After finding the soldier, the third song, the RB number 'Cater 2 U', lyrically is about submissively serving the man considered as such. Inspired by him, the protagonists sing about doing various things to make him happy musically accompanied by synthesizer as the song builds a crescendo.The fourth song 'T-Shirt' is complete with inorganic drum sounds, guitar and backwards loop as the trio sings about sleeping in bed with their man's T-shirt, 'craving his presence, and inhailing his scent'. 'Is She the Reason' is an RB ballad which was noted to have a similar chord progression to materials by The Beatles, which lyrically speaks on being in competition with another woman for her mans loveattention. It contains a trumpet-laden sample from Melba Moore's song 'I Don't Know No One Else to Turn To'. The next song, 'Girl' was noted for its Motown influence and a theme talking about friendship. 'If', complete with strings, lyrically talks about men who don't appreciate their female lovers until their relationship ends and they realize their mistakes. 'Free' was described as a 'soul classic from 1975' with critics also noting elements of 1970s funk music, as the trio speaks on being 'set free' after being in a relationship where her lover never tending to her desires like she does for him. The midtempo number 'Through with Love' was noted for having an 'angry' nature as it talks about a break-up. It contains an undulating piano line as the members of the group sing with restrained vocals and later religious redemption with elements of gospel. In 'Love', 'capital L kicks the daylights out of the forces of fear, doubt and disappointment', as the group 'thank[s] God for love'. They further sing about how people 'can't truly love another until [they] love God and then [themselves]'. They further proclaim that they have found love and are 'madly in it'.Release and promotionThe track listing of Destiny Fulfilled was revealed on October 15, 2004. The album was first released in Japan on November 10, 2004. It was released on November 16, 2004, in North America via Columbia Records. Although the original release was intended to be one day earlier, Columbia Records was concerned about 'potential for Internet leaks and 'burned' CD counterfeits' that could 'lead consumers to experience inferior and incomplete versions of the album' which led to the postponement of Destiny Fulfilled.The group performed 'Lose My Breath' on ABC's 2004 National Football League 'Opening Kickoff' special after its online release on September 9, 2004, to break their yearlong hiatus.

At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 52 based on 17 reviews. Dimitri Ehrlich of Vibe magazine complimented the production of the album, saying that it 'showcases advanced production values' with 'impressive' songwriting and vocal abilities and concluded that it 'offers divine satisfaction'. A writer of Billboard felt that Destiny Fulfilled worked as 'a testament to Beyoncé's evolving multiple talents'. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic praised Rowland's and Williams' abilities as vocalists and their contributions to the choruses, but felt that Beyoncé 'steals every song on Destiny Fulfilled' further commending her for sounding 'larger than life even when she's quiet'; however he concluded, 'as a whole, the album winds up sounding too reserved and heavy-handed, which makes it a disappointment'. Andy Battaglia of The A.V. Club wrote in his review that 'Destiny Fulfilled sounds distant and detached' further criticizing its mid-tempo ballads for sounding 'uninterrupted at best, uninspired at worst'. Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times commented that it is 'a surprisingly perfunctory disc that never quite justifies its existence'. Alan Ranta of Tiny Mix Tapes doubted Beyoncé's lyrical sincerity, saying, 'the success of this album depends once again on the complete suspension of die-hard fans' disbelief that Beyoncé 'Your Ad Here' Knowles could ever actually truly love another human being as much as she loves herself and her possessions.'Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian commented that the lead vocals of the songs were likely to be sung by each member equally, noting that it made the album a 'democratic' one; however she criticized them for squandering 'the extent of their talents' on the album. Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly also noticed its 'overall air of democracy at work' and noted that Destiny Fulfilled 'often moves at a molasses-like pace, weighted down with a preponderance of exquisitely executed but ultimately dull ballads'. Jenny Eliscu of Rolling Stone magazine echoed his comments, saying, 'In all but a couple of songs, the verses are divided into three sections, with Beyonce leading things off, followed by Rowland, then Williams'. She noted that after a couple of upbeat songs, 'the album slumps into an endless string of overwrought RB ballads where the only saving grace is ... these ladies can harmonize like nobody's business.' Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine has commented that the ballads of the album build into 'the same sort of standoffish sexual supply-and-demand bartering that has marred their worst tracks'. Most of the critics questioned why Beyoncé had to return to Destiny's Child after achieving the most success among the members of the group. Henderson lambasted Beyoncé to performing again with the group with the 'full intention' of taking advantage to bolster her 'divette' status to superstardom. In May 2006, Destiny Fulfilled was listed at number 24 on a list titled 'The 50 Worst Albums Ever!' compiled by Q magazine.AccoladesThe album won in the category for Favorite Soul/RB Album at the 2005 American Music Awards where Destiny's Child also won the Favorite Soul/RB Band award. At the 2005 Soul Train Music Awards Destiny Fulfilled received an award for Best RB/Soul Album while 'Soldier' received Best RB/Soul Single. The album was nominated in the category for Best Contemporary RB Album at the 48th Grammy Awards in 2006 but it lost to Mariah Carey's The Emancipation of Mimi. Its singles 'Soldier' and 'Cater 2 U' further received nominations in three different categories at the same ceremony. The previous year, 'Lose My Breath' was nominated in the category for Best RB Vocal Performance by a Duo Or Group at the 47th Annual Grammy Awards.Commercial performanceIn the United States, the album debuted at number 19 on the Billboard 200 for the week ending November 27, 2004 for amassing sales of 61,000 copies prior to a whole tracking week. In its first official week of sales, Destiny Fulfilled sold over 497,000 copies, with an increase of 713", "machine_text": "Destiny Fulfilled is the fourth and final studio album by the American RB group, Destiny's Child.

Buck Martinez was fired about a third of the way through the season, with a 20–33 record. He was replaced by third base coach Carlos Tosca, an experienced minor league manager. They went 58–51 under Tosca to finish the season 78–84. Roy Halladay, a talented but inconsistent prospect who was no more than a fifth starter who alternated between Toronto and Triple-A during his first three seasons, was relied on as the team's ace and rose to the challenge being the team's top pitcher, finishing the season with a 19–7 record and a 2.93 ERA. The hitters were led once again by Carlos Delgado. Ricciardi was credited for dumping Raúl Mondesí in mid-season to the New York Yankees to free up his salary, which in turn was used for the off-season signing of Mike Bordick, Frank Catalanotto and Tanyon Sturtze. Promising young players were assigned to key roles, including starting third baseman Eric Hinske (who later won the Rookie of the Year Award for this year) and 23-year-old centre fielder Vernon Wells, who had his first 100 RBI season replacing Mondesi.

2002 Toronto Blue Jays season was the team's 26th season in Major League Baseball. The team finished fourth in the American League East with a record of 78-84. Offseason: The Blue Jays made several moves during the offseason to try and improve their team. They traded outfielder Shannon Stewart to the Minnesota Twins for a package that included third baseman Bobby Kielty and pitcher Eric Milton. They also signed free agent catcher Greg Myers. Regular season: The Blue Jays started the season off well, winning five of their first six games. However, they struggled to maintain that pace and found themselves below .500 for most of the season. They did have some bright spots, such as Carlos Delgado hitting 33 home runs and driving in 108 runs, and Roy Halladay leading the pitching staff with a 19-7 record and a 2.93 ERA. The Blue Jays also had some memorable moments during the season, such as setting a team record by hitting three grand slams in one game against the Baltimore Orioles on August 25. The team's struggles led to some changes during the season, including the firing of manager Buck Martinez in June and the hiring of Carlos Tosca as his replacement. Despite their disappointing season, the Blue Jays did have some promising young players on the roster who would go on to have successful careers, such as Halladay, Kielty, and Vernon Wells. Postseason: As the Blue Jays missed the playoffs, there was no postseason action for the team. Conclusion: Overall, the 2002 Toronto Blue Jays season was a disappointing one for the team and its fans. Despite some individual successes and memorable moments, the team's inability to consistently win games kept them out of playoff contention.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 12206056}

Twist's typical appearance was with a mortarboard at an angle on his head and a pince-nez on his nose, as he squinted in a bewildered way at his unruly pupils.AppearancesGood Morning, BoysTwist's first appearance was in the 1937 film Good Morning, Boys, in which he is presented as the laid-back headmaster of St. Michael's, a boys school for the sons of rich gentry, where he also teaches Science.Initially, he turns a blind eye to the misbehaviour of the boys under his eye, and teaches the children using his method of Twisterism, which is somehow related to Astrology and the signs of the Zodiac. However, he is later ordered by the school's new governor to adopt stricter policies, eventually turning St. Michael's into a military academy, with Twist holding an officer's rank.Hey! Hey!

Hey! USA! portrayed events that took place those before Good Morning, Boys, explaining Twist's sudden change from teacher to steward, and the absence of St. Michael's School.Convict 99Benjamin Twist's final appearance in the Will Hay films was in the 1938 film Convict 99, which was released shortly after Hey!

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"List of invasive species in the Everglades\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Invasive species in the Everglades are exotic plants and animals that are not native to the area and have aggressively adapted to conditions in wilderness areas in southern Florida. The Everglades are a massive watershed in the southern portion of the U.S. state of Florida that drains overflow from the vast shallow Lake Okeechobee that is in turn fed by the Kissimmee River. The overflow forms a very shallow river aboutwide andlong that travels about half a mile per day. The network of ecosystems created by the Everglades are surrounded by urban areas to the east in the South Florida metropolitan area, to the west by Naples and Fort Myers, and to the south by Florida Bay, a marine environment that receives fresh water from and is maintained by the Everglades. As it is surrounded on three sides and close to a major transportation and shipping center, it is particularly vulnerable to the importation of exotic species.In the 20th century, Florida experienced a population surge unparalleled in the U.S., accompanied by rapid urban expansion made possible by draining portions of the Everglades. Flood control became a priority and the CentralSouth Florida Flood Control Project, from 1947 to 1971, constructed overof canals and flood control structures in South Florida. The widespread building created new habitats and disturbed established plant and animal communities. Many of the new residents or tourists in Florida were responsible for introducing plant species to the area by accident, or deliberately to improve landscaping.Many animals have been introduced similarly, and have either escaped or been released to proliferate on their own. Several terms are used to identify non-native species: exotic, invader, immigrant, colonist, introduced, nonindigenous, and naturalized. 'Naturalized' usually refers to species that have adapted to a region over a long period of time, while 'invasive' refers to particularly destructive or aggressive species.Approximately 26 percent of all fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals in South Florida are exotic—more than in any other part of the United States—and the region hosts one of the highest numbers of exotic plant species in the world. Many of the biological controls like weather, disease, and consumers that naturally limit plants in their native environments do not exist in the Everglades, causing many to grow larger and multiply far beyond their average numbers in their native habitats. Similarly, animals often do not find the predators or natural barriers to reproduction in the Everglades as they do where they originated, thus they often reproduce more quickly and efficiently. Concerns over the quality of the Everglades were raised in the beginning of the 20th century, and by2000 a federally funded initiative was enacted that gave Everglades restoration the distinction of being the largest planned environmental rehabilitation in history. Exotic species control falls under the management of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which has been compiling and disseminating information about invasive species since 1994. Control of invasive species costs 500 million a year, butof land in South Florida remains infested.Plant speciesAs the fields of ecology and environmental studies develop, exotic species attract more attention and their effects become more apparent. Mid-20th century biology texts about invading species reflected more complacency than alarm, as contemporary wisdom about them assumed the host environment would be largely immune. Everglades biologist Thomas Lodge writes that in the 1960s, evidence of non-native plant and animal life in South Florida was present but not particularly 'worthy of notice.' Over the past decades, however, the number of exotic species and their spread has increased dramatically.The Everglades hosts 1,301 species of native flora that are tropical or subtropical in nature, which arrived on the Florida peninsula about 5,000 years ago. Winds, water, and birds carried most of the tropical flora. The subtropical species spread from more northern locations. As of 2010 1,392 additional non-native plant species have been identified and established themselves in South Florida. A variety of avenues are available for species to be brought by humans deliberately or by accident: agricultural experiments, in shipping containers, or attached to vehicles. South Florida is a transportation hub for shipping and traffic between the U.S. and the Caribbean and Central and South America. In 1990, 333 million plants were brought into Miami International Airport. Both the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agriculture Sciences (IFAS) experiment with plants in laboratories throughout Florida.State, local, and federal government agencies spend millions of dollars to rid South Florida of invasive species and prevent more from entering the region. Plants that are imported to Florida are subject to classification as 'Restricted' or 'Prohibited', but a new designation is being considered 'Not Authorized Pending Plant Risk Analysis', to allow scientists to assess what damage exotic plants may cause to the South Florida environment. A nonprofit organization named The Florida Exotic Pest Plant Council lists exotic species as belonging in Category I: 'altering native plant communities by displacing native species, changing community structures or ecological functions, or hybridizing with natives'; and Category II: 'increased in abundance or frequency but have not yet altered Florida plant communities to the extent shown by Category I'. More than 100 species have been placed in Category I, but a few have been singled out for the potential to cause the most destruction based on how rapidly they reproduce, their displacement of native flora by crowding, shading, or fire, excellent adaptations to conditions in the Everglades, and the potential to spread (or evidence that they have spread) into remote areas of the Everglades.Animal speciesAlthough the general effects of invasive animals is not as profound as plants, they are more noticeable in many instances and a constant reminder of the many exotic species in the region. A wildlife biologist and several construction workers near Homestead Air Force Base witnessed a scene where several iguanas sunning themselves in a canal were attacked by a spectacled caiman, to the surprise of all.About 12,500 species of insects are native to Florida, most of which naturally flew into the region from the Caribbean or Southeastern United States. An additional 1,000 have been identified as exotic. Insects create about1 billion of damage to structures and agriculture in Florida each year. The tide of arriving insects is nearly impossible to control with the volume of goods and shipments coming into South Florida. Imported citrus is a major avenue for damaging insects. Twenty-one species have been imported and released to act as biological control agents: to impede the growth of invasive plants or counter the effects of other insects. Others, such as the Madagascan hissing cockroach (Gromphadorhina portentosa) and European cricket (Acheta domesticus) are sold as pets or fishing bait, and are then released into backyards. Similarly, aquatic invertebrates such as mussels, clams, snails, and melania find their ways into local waters from the bottoms of ships or in bilge holds. The aquarium trade also supplies enthusiasts with exotic species which are dumped or escape into waterways.Excluding insects and other arthropods, 192 exotic animal species have established themselves in Florida as of 2009. More than 50 species of fish have been introduced. Early recorded species were the pike killifish (Belonesox belizanus) and oscar (Astronotus ocellatus). The extensive network of canals throughout South Florida allows many species to disperse more readily than they would under natural conditions as many regions in the Everglades go dry each year or experience extended drought periods. The overall impact of exotic fishes on the native populations and habitats is largely unknown.The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) initiated a task force to concentrate on identifying the most invasive animals. The agency created a list of 'Reptiles of Concern' for the Burmese python, African rock python (Python sebae), amethystine python (Simalia amethystinus), reticulated python (Malayopython reticulatus), green anaconda (Eunectes murinus), and Nile monitor. Florida also began requiring owners to pay a permit fee of 100 a year and place microchips on the animals. These predators are included on the list for their formidable size and aggressive natures; animals that were in the Everglades before the list was created, however, are breeding in the wild.Burmese Pythons have become of particular concern as they are starting to adapt to new environment, they easily hide, and in recent years, the population of other species is declining, particularly in the Everglades. To combat the number of exotic snakes in the U.S., and specifically in South Florida, the U.S. Department of the Interior added four species of snakes—the Burmese python, both subspecies of the African rock python (northern and southern), and the yellow anaconda (Eunectes notaeus)—to Lacey Act provisions, making their import into the U.S. illegal, in 2012.Exotic birds do not attract the same amount of attention. They too have been brought to Florida as part of the pet trade and escape, get released by dealers attempting to avoid quarantine restrictions, or escape from damaged cages and artificial habitats during tropical storms. Typically, however, most nonindigenous birds live closer to populated areas; some populations of birds establish themselves but decline for unapparent reasons.More than 50 species of exotic mammals have been recorded in South Florida, at least 19 of which are self-sustaining. Colonies of feral mammals are established in or around the Everglades, including dogs, pigs, and cats. Wild animals native to other parts of the U.S. have also been established, including nine-banded armadillos (Dasypus novemcinctus), coyotes (Canis latrans), and jaguarundi (Herpailurus yaguarondi).Florida has enacted laws to prohibit the release of exotic animals into the wild. To dissuade people from dumping animals, local authorities have begun holding 'Nonnative Amnesty Days' in several Florida locations where pet owners who are no longer willing or able to take care of non-traditional pets such as snakes, lizards, amphibians, birds, and mammals—excluding dogs, cats, and ferrets—can deposit animals without being prosecuted for illegal dumping of exotic species. The FWC has furthermore allowed hunters permits to capture Reptiles of Concern in a specific hunting season in wildlife management areas, euthanize the animals immediately and sell the meat and hides.InvertebratesFishReptilesBirdsMammalsSee also Burmese pythons in Florida Invasive species in the United States List of invasive marine fish in Florida List of invasive plant species in Florida List of invasive species in FloridaFootnotesReferencesFerriter, Amy; Serbesoff-King, Kristina; Bodle, Mike; Goodyear, Carole; Doren, Bob; Langeland, Ken (2004).

Invasive species are a growing problem in the Everglades, and they threaten the native plants and animals that depend on this fragile ecosystem. The following is a list of invasive species that have been introduced to the Everglades: 1. Burmese Python - The Burmese python is a large constrictor snake native to Southeast Asia. These snakes have become a major problem in the Everglades since they were first introduced by exotic pet owners. They are known to prey on native wildlife, including deer, raccoons, and even alligators. 2. Brazilian Pepper - Brazilian pepper is a shrub that is native to South America, but it has been introduced to many parts of the world, including the Everglades. Brazilian pepper can grow to be 30 feet high and form dense thickets that crowd out native plants. 3. Australian Pine - Australian pine is a tree that is native to Australia. It was introduced to Florida in the early 1900s for use as a windbreak and for erosion control. Australian pine is an invasive species in the Everglades because it competes with native trees and shrubs for resources. 4. Old World Climbing Fern - The Old World climbing fern is a vine that is native to Africa and Asia. It was introduced to Florida in the 1930s as an ornamental plant. The fern can grow to be 100 feet long and can climb over and smother native vegetation. 5. Melaleuca - Melaleuca is a tree that is native to Australia. It was introduced to Florida in the early 1900s to drain marshy land. Melaleuca has become an invasive species in the Everglades because it can grow quickly and form dense stands that displace native vegetation. 6. Water Hyacinth - Water hyacinth is a floating plant that is native to South America. It was introduced to Florida in the 1880s as an ornamental plant. Water hyacinth is an invasive species in the Everglades because it can spread rapidly and form dense mats that block sunlight and oxygen from reaching the water. These invasive species are just a few of the many that threaten the health and diversity of the Everglades. Efforts are underway to control and eliminate invasive species, but it remains a challenging and ongoing problem in this important ecosystem.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 26093341}

It was established in 1790 and lasted until 1866, making it one of the oldest Methodist societies in the United States. The society was founded by a group of local Methodists who had been attending services in nearby Great Barrington. The Tyringham society quickly grew in size and importance, becoming a center of Methodist worship and community life in the region. In the early years, services were held in private homes and barns, but in 1803 the society built its own meetinghouse on Main Road. The meetinghouse was a simple wooden structure, with a raised pulpit, benches for the congregation, and a small gallery. It was the center of religious activity in the town, hosting services, revivals, and camp meetings. Many of the leading figures of the early Methodist church visited Tyringham, including Francis Asbury, the first bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church in America. The Methodist Episcopal Society of Tyringham was not just a religious organization, but also an important cultural institution in the town. It sponsored concerts, lectures, and other cultural events, and its members founded a lending library and a literary society. The society was also involved in social and charitable work, supporting local schools, temperance societies, and the abolition of slavery. The society struggled in the mid-19th century, as membership declined and many members joined other churches or left the area in search of work. The meetinghouse was sold in 1866, and the society officially disbanded soon after.

He was accepted into Harvard and Wharton, but couldn't afford tuition. Instead, he went to work in a timber and coal company with local offices. At age 21 he proved himself to be an effective farm manager, making investment decisions that dramatically increased the output of a local farm under the firms control.,Career Schram's early success in farm management led him accept a position as chairman of the National Drainage Association, an agricultural trade group. While working for the Association, Schram applied for loans with the Reconstruction Finance Corporation which was a Depression/New Deal era government corporation tasked with making loans to infrastructure projects and businesses and helping banks resume normal operations.In 1933, Schram joined the Reconstruction Finance Corporation.

After completing his studies, Schram worked for several chemical companies in Germany before emigrating to the United States in 1929 to work for the B.F. Goodrich Company in Akron, Ohio. There, he developed a method for synthesizing butadiene, a key ingredient in the production of synthetic rubber. This breakthrough helped to support the Allied war effort during World War II and was crucial in establishing the rubber industry in the United States. In addition to his work on synthetic rubber, Schram was also instrumental in the development of fuel additives that improve gasoline performance and reduce engine emissions. He was the co-inventor of tetraethyllead, a controversial gasoline additive that was banned in the United States in the 1970s due to health and environmental concerns. Despite these controversies, Schram was widely respected as a talented and innovative chemist. He was awarded more than 300 patents over the course of his career and was elected to the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 1977.

Sofi Sinan Pasha, an Albanian and former beylerbey and kaymakam in Bosnia should not be confused with grand vizier Sinan Pasha, who built the Sinan Pasha Mosque in the nearby city of Kačanik.It is widely considered that the stones used to build the mosque were taken from nearby Saint Archangels Monastery, a Serbian Orthodox monastery founded by Serbian Emperor Stefan Dušan. In fact, parts of the former monastery can be seen in the mosque. The monastery, which was abandoned after the arrival of the Ottomans in the 16th century, had fallen to ruins by the 17th century. Hasan Kaleshi, an Albanian historian, sustained in 1972 that Sofi Sinan Pasha couldn't have possibly ordered any monastery destruction as this was impossible without a Sultan decree, rather, he ordered the use of the spare stones to a better deed as ordered by the Sultan.DescriptionThe mosque covers roughlybyand is square in shape.

The stone flooring of the mosque and the carpentry are original.Preservation concernsRain, which over time has entered the mosque via holes in the roof, has caused the loss of some original paintings on the walls and has led to the detachment of some of the wall plaster. Stones of the façade have faced weathering.Abdullah Gërguri worked on a series of repairs of the murals, particularly in the 1970s.In early 2000 the cost to rehabilitate the building was estimated at about €500,000 by UNESCO.Manuscripts and use of building controversyThe Prizren municipality intended to build a library within the mosque in order to preserve not only the original Ottoman manuscripts found in the mosque, but also other valuable ones that can be found all over Kosovo. However, the Islamic Union of Kosovo filed a lawsuit against the Prizren Municipality in order to not allow the mosque to become a museum, but instead to have it continue to be a religious building.See alsoList of mosques in KosovoNotesReferencesMosques in Prizren Ottoman mosques in Kosovo Religious buildings and structures completed in 1615 1615 establishments in the Ottoman Empire 17th-century mosques Cultural Monuments of Exceptional Importance (Serbia) Monuments and memorials in Kosovo", "machine_text": "Sinan Pasha Mosque is a significant historical monument located in the city of Prizren in Kosovo.

These countries included the USSR and all the Comecon members. NMP is the conceptual equivalent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the United Nations System of National Accounts, although numerically the two measures are calculated differently.NMP is calculated for the material production sectors only, and excludes most of the service sectors, which are part of GDP. The material production sectors include manufacturing industries,agriculture and forestry, construction, wholesale and retail trade, supply of material inputs, road maintenance, freight transport (but not passenger transport), communication and information services supporting material production, and other material production activities. It is calculated by subtracting the value of all production costs (including the cost of material inputs, depreciation, and labor in production) from the value of output produced in the material production sectors.For comparison with GDP, it is necessary to add back to NMP the value of fixed asset depreciation (which is not subtracted in GDP calculations) and the total value of all services classified as 'non-productive' in the socialist system of national accounts (which are part of GDP). These 'non-productive' services include health care, education, housing, public utilities, consumer services, communication in the non-productive sector, passenger transport, financial services (banking, credit, insurance), government services, the defense establishment, and social organizations.

They could be made from a variety of materials such as nylon, polyester, cotton, and even metal. Net material products come in various shapes and sizes, including bags, sacks, pouches, hammocks, and even garments. History The use of net material products can be traced back to ancient times. Ancient Egyptians used nets to capture fish, and the concept of fishing nets was eventually adopted by other cultures. Similarly, ancient Greeks used nets to build hanging beds, which would eventually evolve into the modern-day hammock. In more recent times, the development of synthetic materials such as nylon and polyester saw a significant increase in the production of net material products. These materials are lightweight, durable, and can be easily molded into various shapes, making them ideal for the production of different types of net material products. Uses Net material products have numerous uses in different areas of life. They are commonly used for carrying and storing items such as groceries, clothes, and sports equipment. Net bags are particularly popular for carrying fruits and vegetables while shopping, as they allow air to circulate, keeping the produce fresh for longer periods. Hammocks and related products are also popular net material products that are used for relaxation purposes. They are ideal for use outdoors, particularly in areas with warm climates where the air is still and humid. Conclusion Net material products have proven to be versatile, durable, and easy to use. Their uses are varied, making them an indispensable part of our daily lives. With advances in technology and the development of new synthetic materials, the potential for the production of new and innovative net material products is endless.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 19188931}

He was a younger brother of Sir Archibald Edmonstone, 1st Baronet of Duntreath and Newton. As a younger son he was not likely to inherit the baronetcy and followed a military career.It seems possible that he met David Hume at the University of Edinburgh and seems equally likely that he (as Hume) dropped out without graduating due to a lack of respect for the professors.At some point he joined the Perthshire Militia but may have transferred to the 3rd Dragoon Guards.He served at rank of captain in Brittany. He rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel and served variously in Geneva, Sienna, Paris and Dublin. Whilst having a military title a large proportion of this travel appears to have been in the role of 'travelling tutor' to the family of John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute (Lord Mountstuart). Due to the age of Earl Stuart's youngest child this role would have ceased by 1775 or before.In 1745 he (or his family) entertained Bonnie Prince Charlie for an evening at Old Newton House.In 1785 he lived at Adam's Court in Edinburgh. Here he was visited by David Hume who also visited his house at Doune.In 1793 he was admitted as a Member of the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland.

He was born in Edinburgh in 1710, and although little is known about his early life, it is believed that he was educated at the University of Edinburgh. In 1758, Edmonstone joined the British East India Company as a surgeon, and he sailed to India, where he spent several years exploring the country. However, it was his voyage to the Eastern Seas in the mid-1760s that established his reputation as a naturalist and explorer. During this voyage, Edmonstone collected specimens of plants, animals, and insects from all over the region, and his observations formed the basis of his magnum opus, which was published in 1771. The work, which consisted of four volumes, contained detailed descriptions and illustrations of a wide range of flora and fauna, and it also provided valuable information about the geography, climate, and culture of the region. Edmonstone's contributions to zoology were particularly significant, as he was one of the first Europeans to describe many of the species he encountered, including the orangutan, the royal penguin, and the cockatoo. He also made important observations about the behavior and ecology of these animals.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Earth's rotation\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Earth's rotation or Earth's spin is the rotation of planet Earth around its own axis, as well as changes in the orientation of the rotation axis in space. Earth rotates eastward, in prograde motion. As viewed from the north pole star Polaris, Earth turns counterclockwise.The North Pole, also known as the Geographic North Pole or Terrestrial North Pole, is the point in the Northern Hemisphere where Earth's axis of rotation meets its surface. This point is distinct from Earth's North Magnetic Pole. The South Pole is the other point where Earth's axis of rotation intersects its surface, in Antarctica.Earth rotates once in about 24 hours with respect to the Sun, but once every 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4 seconds with respect to other distant stars (see below). Earth's rotation is slowing slightly with time; thus, a day was shorter in the past. This is due to the tidal effects the Moon has on Earth's rotation. Atomic clocks show that a modern-day is longer by about 1.7 milliseconds than a century ago, slowly increasing the rate at which UTC is adjusted by leap seconds. Analysis of historical astronomical records shows a slowing trend; the length of a day increased about 2.3 milliseconds per century since the 8th century BCE. Scientists reported that in 2020 Earth has started spinning faster, after consistently spinning slower than 86,400 seconds per day in the decades before. Because of that, engineers worldwide are discussing a 'negative leap second' and other possible timekeeping measures.History Among the ancient Greeks, several of the Pythagorean school believed in the rotation of Earth rather than the apparent diurnal rotation of the heavens. Perhaps the first was Philolaus (470–385 BCE), though his system was complicated, including a counter-earth rotating daily about a central fire.A more conventional picture was supported by Hicetas, Heraclides and Ecphantus in the fourth century BCE who assumed that Earth rotated but did not suggest that Earth revolved about the Sun. In the third century BCE, Aristarchus of Samos suggested the Sun's central place.However, Aristotle in the fourth century BCE criticized the ideas of Philolaus as being based on theory rather than observation. He established the idea of a sphere of fixed stars that rotated about Earth. This was accepted by most of those who came after, in particular Claudius Ptolemy (2nd century CE), who thought Earth would be devastated by gales if it rotated.In 499 CE, the Indian astronomer Aryabhata suggested that the spherical Earth rotates about its axis daily, and that the apparent movement of the stars is a relative motion caused by the rotation of Earth. He provided the following analogy: 'Just as a man in a boat going in one direction sees the stationary things on the bank as moving in the opposite direction, in the same way to a man at Lanka the fixed stars appear to be going westward.'In the 10th century, some Muslim astronomers accepted that Earth rotates around its axis. According to al-Biruni, Abu Sa'id al-Sijzi (d. circa 1020) invented an astrolabe called al-zūraqī based on the idea believed by some of his contemporaries 'that the motion we see is due to the Earth's movement and not to that of the sky.' The prevalence of this view is further confirmed by a reference from the 13th century which states: 'According to the geometers [or engineers] (muhandisīn), the Earth is in constant circular motion, and what appears to be the motion of the heavens is actually due to the motion of the Earth and not the stars.' Treatises were written to discuss its possibility, either as refutations or expressing doubts about Ptolemy's arguments against it. At the Maragha and Samarkand observatories, Earth's rotation was discussed by Tusi (b. 1201) and Qushji (b. 1403); the arguments and evidence they used resemble those used by Copernicus.In medieval Europe, Thomas Aquinas accepted Aristotle's view and so, reluctantly, did John Buridan and Nicole Oresme in the fourteenth century. Not until Nicolaus Copernicus in 1543 adopted a heliocentric world system did the contemporary understanding of Earth's rotation begin to be established. Copernicus pointed out that if the movement of Earth is violent, then the movement of the stars must be very much more so. He acknowledged the contribution of the Pythagoreans and pointed to examples of relative motion. For Copernicus this was the first step in establishing the simpler pattern of planets circling a central Sun.Tycho Brahe, who produced accurate observations on which Kepler based his laws of planetary motion, used Copernicus's work as the basis of a system assuming a stationary Earth. In 1600, William Gilbert strongly supported Earth's rotation in his treatise on Earth's magnetism and thereby influenced many of his contemporaries. Those like Gilbert who did not openly support or reject the motion of Earth about the Sun are called 'semi-Copernicans'. A century after Copernicus, Riccioli disputed the model of a rotating Earth due to the lack of then-observable eastward deflections in falling bodies; such deflections would later be called the Coriolis effect. However, the contributions of Kepler, Galileo and Newton gathered support for the theory of the rotation of Earth.Empirical tests Earth's rotation implies that the Equator bulges and the geographical poles are flattened. In his Principia, Newton predicted this flattening would occur in the ratio of 1:230, and pointed to the pendulum measurements taken by Richer in 1673 as corroboration of the change in gravity, but initial measurements of meridian lengths by Picard and Cassini at the end of the 17th century suggested the opposite. However, measurements by Maupertuis and the French Geodesic Mission in the 1730s established the oblateness of Earth, thus confirming the positions of both Newton and Copernicus.In Earth's rotating frame of reference, a freely moving body follows an apparent path that deviates from the one it would follow in a fixed frame of reference. Because of the Coriolis effect, falling bodies veer slightly eastward from the vertical plumb line below their point of release, and projectiles veer right in the Northern Hemisphere (and left in the Southern) from the direction in which they are shot. The Coriolis effect is mainly observable at a meteorological scale, where it is responsible for the opposite directions of cyclone rotation in the Northern and Southern hemispheres (anticlockwise and clockwise, respectively).Hooke, following a suggestion from Newton in 1679, tried unsuccessfully to verify the predicted eastward deviation of a body dropped from a height of , but definitive results were obtained later, in the late 18th and early 19th century, by Giovanni Battista Guglielmini in Bologna, Johann Friedrich Benzenberg in Hamburg and Ferdinand Reich in Freiberg, using taller towers and carefully released weights. A ball dropped from a height of 158.5 m departed by 27.4 mm from the vertical compared with a calculated value of 28.1 mm.The most celebrated test of Earth's rotation is the Foucault pendulum first built by physicist Léon Foucault in 1851, which consisted of a lead-filled brass sphere suspendedfrom the top of the Panthéon in Paris. Because of Earth's rotation under the swinging pendulum, the pendulum's plane of oscillation appears to rotate at a rate depending on latitude. At the latitude of Paris the predicted and observed shift was aboutclockwise per hour. Foucault pendulums now swing in museums around the world.PeriodsTrue solar dayEarth's rotation period relative to the Sun (solar noon to solar noon) is its true solar day or apparent solar day. It depends on Earth's orbital motion and is thus affected by changes in the eccentricity and inclination of Earth's orbit. Both vary over thousands of years, so the annual variation of the true solar day also varies. Generally, it is longer than the mean solar day during two periods of the year and shorter during another two. The true solar day tends to be longer near perihelion when the Sun apparently moves along the ecliptic through a greater angle than usual, taking aboutlonger to do so. Conversely, it is aboutshorter near aphelion. It is aboutlonger near a solstice when the projection of the Sun's apparent motion along the ecliptic onto the celestial equator causes the Sun to move through a greater angle than usual. Conversely, near an equinox the projection onto the equator is shorter by about . Currently, the perihelion and solstice effects combine to lengthen the true solar day nearbysolar seconds, but the solstice effect is partially cancelled by the aphelion effect nearwhen it is onlylonger. The effects of the equinoxes shorten it nearandbyand , respectively.Mean solar dayThe average of the true solar day during the course of an entire year is the mean solar day, which contains . Currently, each of these seconds is slightly longer than an SI second because Earth's mean solar day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th century due to tidal friction. The average length of the mean solar day since the introduction of the leap second in 1972 has been about 0 to 2 ms longer than . Random fluctuations due to core-mantle coupling have an amplitude of about 5 ms. The mean solar second between 1750 and 1892 was chosen in 1895 by Simon Newcomb as the independent unit of time in his Tables of the Sun. These tables were used to calculate the world's ephemerides between 1900 and 1983, so this second became known as the ephemeris second. In 1967 the SI second was made equal to the ephemeris second.The apparent solar time is a measure of Earth's rotation and the difference between it and the mean solar time is known as the equation of time.Stellar and sidereal dayEarth's rotation period relative to the International Celestial Reference Frame, called its stellar day by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS), isseconds of mean solar time (UT1) , ). Earth's rotation period relative to the precessing mean vernal equinox, named sidereal day, isof mean solar time (UT1) , ). Thus, the sidereal day is shorter than the stellar day by about .Both the stellar day and the sidereal day are shorter than the mean solar day by about. This is a result of the Earth turning 1 additional rotation, relative to the celestial reference frame, as it orbits the Sun (so 366.25 rotations/y). The mean solar day in SI seconds is available from the IERS for the periodsand .Recently (1999–2010) the average annual length of the mean solar day in excess ofhas varied betweenand , which must be added to both the stellar and sidereal days given in mean solar time above to obtain their lengths in SI seconds (see Fluctuations in the length of day).Angular speedThe angular speed of Earth's rotation in inertial space is± . Multiplying by (180°/π radians) × (86,400 seconds/day) yields , indicating that Earth rotates more than 360° relative to the fixed stars in one solar day. Earth's movement along its nearly circular orbit while it is rotating once around its axis requires that Earth rotate slightly more than once relative to the fixed stars before the mean Sun can pass overhead again, even though it rotates only once (360°) relative to the mean Sun. Multiplying the value in rad/s by Earth's equatorial radius of(WGS84 ellipsoid) (factors of 2π radians needed by both cancel) yields an equatorial speed of . Some sources state that Earth's equatorial speed is slightly less, or . This is obtained by dividing Earth's equatorial circumference by . However, the use of the solar day is incorrect; it must be the sidereal day, so the corresponding time unit must be a sidereal hour. This is confirmed by multiplying by the number of sidereal days in one mean solar day, , which yields the equatorial speed in mean solar hours given above of 1,674.4 km/h.The tangential speed of Earth's rotation at a point on Earth can be approximated by multiplying the speed at the equator by the cosine of the latitude. For example, the Kennedy Space Center is located at latitude 28.59° N, which yields a speed of: cos(28.59°) × 1674.4 km/h = 1470.2 km/h. Latitude is a placement consideration for spaceports.The peak of the Cayambe volcano is the point of Earth's surface farthest from its axis; thus, it rotates the fastest as Earth spins.ChangesIn rotational axisEarth's rotation axis moves with respect to the fixed stars (inertial space); the components of this motion are precession and nutation. It also moves with respect to Earth's crust; this is called polar motion.Precession is a rotation of Earth's rotation axis, caused primarily by external torques from the gravity of the Sun, Moon and other bodies. The polar motion is primarily due to free core nutation and the Chandler wobble.In rotational speedTidal interactionsOver millions of years, Earth's rotation has been slowed significantly by tidal acceleration through gravitational interactions with the Moon. Thus angular momentum is slowly transferred to the Moon at a rate proportional to , whereis the orbital radius of the Moon. This process has gradually increased the length of the day to its current value, and resulted in the Moon being tidally locked with Earth.This gradual rotational deceleration is empirically documented by estimates of day lengths obtained from observations of tidal rhythmites and stromatolites; a compilation of these measurements found that the length of the day has increased steadily from about 21 hours at 600 Myr ago to the current 24-hour value. By counting the microscopic lamina that form at higher tides, tidal frequencies (and thus day lengths) can be estimated, much like counting tree rings, though these estimates can be increasingly unreliable at older ages.Resonant stabilizationThe current rate of tidal deceleration is anomalously high, implying Earth's rotational velocity must have decreased more slowly in the past. Empirical data tentatively shows a sharp increase in rotational deceleration about 600 Myr ago. Some models suggest that Earth maintained a constant day length of 21 hours throughout much of the Precambrian. This day length corresponds to the semidiurnal resonant period of the thermally-driven atmospheric tide; at this day length, the decelerative lunar torque could have been canceled by an accelerative torque from the atmospheric tide, resulting in no net torque and a constant rotational period. This stabilizing effect could have been broken by a sudden change in global temperature. Recent computational simulations support this hypothesis and suggest the Marinoan or Sturtian glaciations broke this stable configuration about 600 Myr ago; the simulated results agree quite closely with existing paleorotational data.Global eventsSome recent large-scale events, such as the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, have caused the length of a day to shorten by 3 microseconds by reducing Earth's moment of inertia. Post-glacial rebound, ongoing since the last Ice age, is also changing the distribution of Earth's mass, thus affecting the moment of inertia of Earth and, by the conservation of angular momentum, Earth's rotation period.The length of the day can also be influenced by manmade structures. For example, NASA scientists calculated that the water stored in the Three Gorges Dam has increased the length of Earth's day by 0.06 microseconds due to the shift in mass.MeasurementThe primary monitoring of Earth's rotation is performed by very-long-baseline interferometry coordinated with the Global Positioning System, satellite laser ranging, and other satellite geodesy techniques. This provides an absolute reference for the determination of universal time, precession, and nutation. The absolute value of Earth rotation including UT1 and nutation can be determined using space geodetic observations, such as Very Long Baseline Interferometry and Lunar laser ranging, whereas their derivatives, denoted as Length-of-day excess and nutation rates can be derived from satellite observations, such as GPS, GLONASS, Galileo and Satellite laser ranging to geodetic satellites.Ancient observations There are recorded observations of solar and lunar eclipses by Babylonian and Chinese astronomers beginning in the 8th century BCE, as well as from the medieval Islamic worldand elsewhere. These observations can be used to determine changes in Earth's rotation over the last 27 centuries, since the length of the day is a critical parameter in the calculation of the place and time of eclipses. A change in day length of milliseconds per century shows up as a change of hours and thousands of kilometers in eclipse observations. The ancient data are consistent with a shorter day, meaning Earth was turning faster throughout the past.Cyclic variabilityAround every 25–30 years Earth's rotation slows temporarily by a few milliseconds per day, usually lasting around 5 years. 2017 was the fourth consecutive year that Earth's rotation has slowed. The cause of this variability has not yet been determined.OriginEarth's original rotation was a vestige of the original angular momentum of the cloud of dust, rocks, and gas that coalesced to form the Solar System. This primordial cloud was composed of hydrogen and helium produced in the Big Bang, as well as heavier elements ejected by supernovas. As this interstellar dust is heterogeneous, any asymmetry during gravitational accretion resulted in the angular momentum of the eventual planet.However, if the giant-impact hypothesis for the origin of the Moon is correct, this primordial rotation rate would have been reset by the Theia impact 4.5 billion years ago. Regardless of the speed and tilt of Earth's rotation before the impact, it would have experienced a day some five hours long after the impact. Tidal effects would then have slowed this rate to its modern value.See alsoAllais effectDiurnal cycleEarth's orbitEarth orientation parametersFormation and evolution of the Solar SystemGeodesic (in mathematics)Geodesics in general relativityGeodesyHistory of EarthHistory of geodesyInner core super-rotationList of important publications in geologyNychthemeronSpherical EarthWorld Geodetic SystemNotesReferencesExternal linksUSNO Earth Orientation new site, being populated USNO IERS old site, to be abandoned IERS Earth Orientation Center: Earth rotation data and interactive analysis International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) If the Earth's rotation period is less than 24 hours, why don't our clocks fall out of sync with the Sun?Dynamics of the Solar System Rotation Rotation", "machine_text": "Earth's rotation is the movement of the Earth around its axis. The Earth rotates once every 24 hours, which causes the apparent motion of the Sun and stars across the sky. This motion is responsible for day and night, and it also affects the climate, ocean currents, and the behavior of living organisms on Earth. The axis of rotation is an imaginary line that passes through the geographical North and South poles. The Earth's axis is tilted at an angle of 23.5 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun. This tilt is the reason why we have seasons, as different parts of the Earth receive different amounts of sunlight throughout the year. The speed of the Earth's rotation varies depending on the latitude and altitude of the observer. At the equator, the Earth's rotation speed is about 1,670 kilometers per hour (1,040 miles per hour). As you move towards the poles, this speed decreases, until it becomes zero at the North and South poles. The concept of Earth's rotation was first discovered by the ancient Greeks. They observed the motion of the stars across the sky and realized that the Earth must be moving. However, it was only in the 16th century that Copernicus proposed a heliocentric model of the Solar System, where the Earth and other planets revolve around the Sun. Today, we know that the Earth's rotation is not constant and is affected by various factors such as the gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun, as well as the Earth's own internal dynamics. The length of a day on Earth is also not constant and varies by a few milliseconds over time, due to these factors. In conclusion, Earth's rotation is a fundamental aspect of our planet's functioning, responsible for creating day and night and shaping our climate and ecology. Understanding it is crucial for predicting and mitigating the impact of changes in Earth's rotation on our lives and environment.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 4396171}

Along with her younger cousin, Grace Stepney, she lives with her wealthy aunt, Julia Peniston.Lily genuinely admires lawyer Lawrence Selden, but he is too poor for her to seriously consider marrying. Her choices are limited to coarse, vulgar Simon Rosedale, a rising financier, and wealthy but dull Percy Gryce. Lily’s friend Judy Trenor urges her to pursue Gryce. Lily, however, cannot help preferring Selden, and during a country weekend, they take a long walk and share an innocent kiss. Gryce, with whom Lily has broken two appointments, leaves abruptly. Fearful for her future, a dejected Lily pours out her troubles to Judy's husband, Gus Trenor. He leads her to believe he will help her earn money through investment. Later, Lily purchases scandalous letters written by Bertha Dorset revealing that Selden was her lover. Lily is hurt, but keeps the letters secret.At a wedding, Lily receives a 5,000 check from Gus Trenor, who claims to have reinvested another4,000. Later, he invites Lily to the opera, where she is seen by her disapproving aunt and Lawrence Selden as she sits with Trenor and Rosedale. Trenor tricks her into leaving the opera and accompanying him to his home, where he tries to kiss her, claiming that Lily is not playing a fair game when she accepts his money but refuses him her attentions. When Lily arrives home, her aunt refuses to loan her the money to repay the 9000 she received from Trenor. Lily confides in Grace, asking if she should turn to Selden for his understanding, but Grace advises against it; she loves Lawrence and is jealous of Lily. Lily had arranged a later appointment with Selden while at the wedding, and she counts on his love for her to overcome her foolish mistakes.While Lily is hoping to hear from Selden, Rosedale visits, proposing to her as if suggesting a corporate merger. His wealth could free Lily, yet she politely rejects his flattering but cold blooded proposal. Bertha Dorset invites Lily to the Dorsets' yacht for a European cruise.

They are both worried about Lily, travelling on the Dorsets’ yacht. Lily and George Dorset converse on deck while a young man reads French poetry to Bertha. While ashore that evening, Lily and George look for them in vain before returning to the yacht. Next morning, George enters Lily's cabin, accusing her of knowing about Bertha's indiscretions with the young poet. Lily pleads ignorance of Bertha’s behavior but when Bertha returns and Lily confronts her, saying she can no longer divert George’s attention from Bertha’s affair, Bertha turns the tables by accusing Lily of adultery with George, since Lily was alone aboard the yacht with him all night.Back in New York, the Dorsets are still in marital discord and Aunt Julia has died. Lily receives only a fraction of her vast fortune, the bulk having been left to Cousin Grace. Now homeless and adrift, Lily is invited by Carry Fisher to stay with her and the Gormers for the summer. Carry believes Lily's two possibilities for marriage are George Dorset and Simon Rosedale. George asks Lily for the truth about his wife Bertha's infidelities, but she denies any knowledge of them. In her growing desperation she approaches Simon Rosedale. He has found out about Bertha's letters and advises Lily to use them to force Bertha to restore her social standing. He offers to marry Lily once she and Bertha are reconciled, but Lily refuses.Lily starts working for the social-climbing Mrs. Hatch as her social secretary. Selden tells Lily this hurts her social standing, but she needs the money. They argue and part on bad terms. Lily goes to the pharmacy for Mrs. Hatch's laudanum sleeping medication, and begins taking it herself. After Mrs. Hatch gets into society, she discovers that Lily's reputation is a liability, so she fires her. Lily gets a job sewing for a milliner, but her growing addiction leads to her being fired for poor work. Lily visits her cousin Grace for a loan but is rejected.Lily almost confronts Bertha Dorset with the letters written to Mr. Selden, but finding that the Dorsets have left town, she goes to Lawrence Selden, telling him she knows she lost his love. When Lawrence isn't looking, she throws the letters in his lit fireplace. Lily goes home and finds her inheritance has at last been delivered. She puts the check in an envelope she addresses to her bank, and writes another for Gus Trenor, resolving the massive debts, and then takes a fatal dose of the laudanum, drifting off to oblivion in her darkened room. Finding the partially-burnt letters in his fireplace and sensing her intentions, Selden rushes to her boarding room. There, at her deathbed, holding her hand, he weeps, declaring his love for her.CastProduction Parts of the film were shot at Gosford House in East Lothian, Scotland and at Manderston House in the Scottish Borders.Release The House of Mirth premiered at the New York Film Festival on 23 September 2000.Sony Pictures Classics released it in the U.S. on 22 December 2000.There, it grossed48,770 in its opening week-end and 3,000,000 in total.The world-wide total is5.1 million.Reception The House of Mirth has an 81", "machine_text": "The House of Mirth is a 2000 film adaptation of Edith Wharton’s eponymous novel, starring Gillian Anderson, Dan Aykroyd, Eric Stoltz, and Laura Linney. The movie was directed by Terence Davies and scripted by Davies himself, based on Wharton’s classic novel that takes place in New York City during the Gilded Age. The film was praised for its impressive visual style and the lead performance of Anderson, securing it six nominations for the 2001 Independent Spirit Awards. The film follows Lily Bart (Gillian Anderson), a beautiful, but impoverished, socialite who lives in New York City in the early 20th century. Lily has been raised to marry for money and status, but she prefers to marry for love and her own passions. She is torn between her true feelings and the desperate need to secure a wealthy husband, as her financial situation continues to worsen. Despite Lily’s alluring nature, her social standing begins to slip away due to both her gambling debts and rumors of an affair with a married man. Gillian Anderson delivers a captivating performance, showcasing her talents beyond her celebrated role as Dana Scully in The X-Files series. The supporting cast is also commendable with Aykroyd portraying a ruthless banker, Stoltz as Lawrence Selden, a poor lawyer with a romantic interest in Lily, and Linney playing Bertha Dorset, a scheming former friend of Lily. The House of Mirth is visually stunning; from the elaborate costumes and sets to the subtle lighting and camera angles, the film captures the opulence and decadence of the Gilded Age and its accompanying societal norms. The stunning visuals work effectively in evoking the contrasting themes of conspicuous consumption and hidden desperation, leading to the powerful climax of the film. Overall, The House of Mirth is a visually stunning adaptation of Wharton's novel, boasting excellent performances and a captivating story of a woman fighting against societal expectations. The film stands as one of the finest adaptations of Wharton's work, communicating the writer's preoccupation with the strictures of society and its effect on women.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 15670779}

Brilliant would be our son whom you would beget.' Liadain replied 'Let us not do so, so that my tour is not spoiled for me. If you might come for me again, to my house, I shall come with you.' They slept together that night, and parted the following day.However, before she and Cuirithir met again, Liadain became a nun. It is uncertain if this is 'a conflict between love and religion [or if] Liadain postpones the marriage to Cuirithir because of her professional interests as a travelling poetess.'The couple seek the spiritual aid of St. Cummine (Cumméne Fota. However, Cuirithir breaks the vow of chastity and is banished to another monastery by Cummine, being also forced to renounce his love of Liadain. He later crosses the sea while Liadain endures penance and prayer before dying of a broken heart.Historical basis Cuirithir and Laidain are believed to have been historical figures alive in 7th-century Ireland, and the basic facts of the story are believed to be true.Verse Ruth Lehmann's translation of part of the tale, as told by Liadain:No pleasure in deed done to loving-one; tormenting without measure. What madness not to give him happiness, though fear of God feed sadness. No ruin, his affair desirable through pain heaven pursuing.

She was born in the late 6th century and died in the mid-7th century. Her poems are noted for their beautiful imagery and lyrical quality, and they are considered some of the finest examples of early Irish poetry. Líadan was born into a noble family, but little else is known about her early life. She became a poet at a young age and quickly gained a reputation for her talent. Her poetry was influenced by the Christian faith, which was rapidly spreading throughout Ireland at the time, as well as by the traditional pagan beliefs of her ancestors. One of Líadan's famous works is 'The Exile's Return,' a poem that tells the story of a young man who has been forced to leave Ireland and must live in exile for many years. The poem is notable for its beautiful descriptions of the Irish landscape and for its exploration of themes such as love, loss, and the longing for home. Another famous poem by Líadan is 'The White Bird,' a song about a bird who brings a message of love to a young woman. The poem is notable for its use of vivid imagery and for its exploration of themes such as the power of nature and the importance of love in human life. Despite her talent as a poet, Líadan's life was not without its difficulties. She was part of a society that was often hostile toward women who sought to pursue their own passions and interests. In addition, the early Christian church in Ireland was often suspicious of the old pagan ways and the traditional role of the poet in Irish society. Despite these challenges, Líadan's poetry has continued to be celebrated for its beauty and its insights into the human experience. Today, she is remembered as one of the greatest poets of early Irish literature.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 29241776}

It was a tightly contested election between the Republican nominee, Kirk Fordice, and the Democratic nominee, Ray Mabus. In the end, Fordice prevailed by a small margin and became the first Republican governor of Mississippi since Reconstruction. The election was notable for a number of reasons. It marked a significant shift in the politics of Mississippi, which had long been dominated by the Democratic Party. It was also the first time that a candidate who had never before held public office won the governorship of Mississippi. The campaign was bitter and divisive, with both candidates engaging in negative advertising and personal attacks. Mabus, who had served as governor for the previous four years, was a popular and well-respected figure in the state. He campaigned on his record of improving education and infrastructure, as well as his commitment to racial reconciliation and civil rights. Fordice, on the other hand, ran as a conservative businessman who promised to cut taxes and reduce government spending. He also appealed to white voters by criticizing affirmative action programs and opposing desegregation orders in public housing. Despite Mabus' popularity, Fordice was able to win the election by a margin of just 4,000 votes. His victory was seen as a major milestone for the Republican Party in Mississippi, which had been struggling to gain a foothold in the state for decades. In the years that followed, Fordice was able to implement many of the conservative policies that he had promised during his campaign. He cut taxes, reduced the size of government, and worked to limit the power of labor unions. His tenure as governor was marked by both accomplishments and controversies, but he remained a popular figure among conservative voters in the state until his death in 2004.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 52459654}

She said:'When [a coach] has so much control, it puts a young person in a mindset that the coach has more authority than anyone else in their life - that they should put all their faith in them...There's a fine line between...where the culture is healthy, to a culture of silence...[In elite gymnastics, gymnasts] were not allowed to speak...That does a lot to you, psychologically. You try to be as meek and as serious as possible. 'Stoic' was this huge compliment at [national training] camp. We all strived for that. Being someone who never complained was a compliment.

It was built between 1897 and 1899 to defend the area stretching from Delimara Point to Xrobb l-Għaġin. It formed part of a new series of fortifications meant to house breech-loading (BL) guns. The 18th century Tombrell Battery was demolished in the 19th century to clear Wolseley Battery's line of fire.The battery has an oval plan with four gun emplacements, which originally contained two 9.2 inch and two 6 inch BL guns. The gun emplacements are surrounded by a shallow ditch, which was originally defended by barbed wire entanglements. The rear of the battery was sealed off by an iron fence. The battery also had machine gun emplacements, and it was the first fortification in Malta to have these features.Wolseley Battery became obsolete by 1906, and its 6-inch guns were transferred to the newly built Wardija Battery near St. Paul's Bay in 1915. The battery was fully decommissioned a year later in 1916.A stone-clad pillbox was built behind the officers' quarters in the 1930s.Present day Today, the battery still exists, but there is no public access since it is private property.

The battery was constructed by the Canadian government in 1885 as part of its efforts to suppress the Métis rebellion led by Louis Riel. The Wolseley Battery was made up of two Gatling guns and two 7-pounder guns, which were operated by a crew of 38 men, including Lieutenant-Colonel George T. Denison, who was in command of the battery. The soldiers stationed at the battery were part of the Quebec-based Royal Canadian Artillery and were supported by a company of infantry under the command of Major-General Frederick Middleton. The battery was located approximately 30 miles northeast of the town of Wolseley, overlooking the north branch of the Qu’Appelle River. On April 4, 1885, the Métis and their Aboriginal allies launched a surprise attack on the Wolseley Battery, seeking to capture the guns and disrupt the Canadian military’s advance towards Batoche, the stronghold of the Métis rebellion in the Saskatchewan region. The Métis and Aboriginal fighters were led by Gabriel Dumont, who had gained experience in combat during the Red River Rebellion of 1869–70. Despite initial success in disarming some of the Canadian artillerymen and forcing the remainder to retreat, the Métis were eventually repulsed by the arrival of Canadian infantry reinforcements and retreated towards Batoche. The Wolseley Battery is considered an important landmark in Canadian military history, as it was one of the sites where the Canadian military demonstrated its effectiveness in suppressing Indigenous resistance to colonial expansion in the late 19th century. The site of the Wolseley Battery is now a designated National Historic Site, marked by a cairn and plaque commemorating the historical significance of the event.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 46963530}

The calligrapher is thought to be the same on the five scrolls as on the hell scroll and the demon of punishment, which were produced at roughly the same time. They are thought to have originally been a single handscroll, known as the 'second edition of the Masuda family hell scroll', that was stored in the Rengeō-in Temple (now Sanjūsangen-dō). The paintings depict five benevolent deities in combat against evil, as represented by demons; the deities come from several cultures, including contemporary Japanese, Chinese, and Indian. They are thought to be associated with the hell transformation screens then used in Nara for repentance ceremonies at the end of each year, where the devout recited the names of the buddhas at Heijō Palace.The paintings were designated National Treasures of Japan on 6 June 1985, with the accession number 1106.

This ideology is often associated with extremist groups and cults that see themselves as righteous warriors who are destined to purge society of all evil. The idea of extermination of evil has been prevalent in many societies throughout history. From religious zealots to political fanatics, many groups have believed that the only way to create a perfect society is by eliminating those who do not comply with their morals and standards. This has led to countless atrocities throughout history, from the Salem witch trials to the Holocaust. In modern times, the ideology of extermination of evil has been embraced by terrorist organizations such as ISIS and Al-Qaeda. These groups see themselves as soldiers in a holy war, fighting against the corrupt and immoral Western world. They believe that killing innocent civilians and perpetrating acts of violence is justified in their mission to create a pure and righteous society. The concept of extermination of evil has been widely condemned by moral and ethical leaders. They argue that the idea of a perfect society free of all imperfections is impossible and that attempting to achieve it through violence and terror is both futile and immoral. Instead, they propose a more nuanced approach to addressing social and moral issues, one that promotes dialogue, understanding, and empathy for all. They believe that only by recognizing and respecting the diversity of individual beliefs and lifestyles can we create a just and peaceful society. In conclusion, extermination of evil reflects a flawed and extremist ideology that has led to untold suffering and violence throughout human history.

The Military Public Affairs Enhancement and Employment Concept (MPAEEC) set out the reasons for change and vision for the Branch, explaining that the current construct 'lacks the proper readiness to effectively support overseas operations', and noted five deficiencies of the public affairs function and officers within: insufficient military culture, expertise and readiness; reactive, rather than strategic-driven engagement; ineffectual management of visual communications; lack of innovation; and insufficient [Canadian Armed Forces] capacity and mindsets.The situation was described as a consequence of structural changes over time within the Assistant Deputy Minister Public Affairs organization that put emphasis on civilian rather than military practitioners, and 'led to a dilution of military culture and a lack of focus on martial imperatives. In recent years it has been difficult to distinguish the difference in roles between the civilian and CAF communications, leading to a corporate mindset among some [Public Affairs Officers] and Image Techs.'

In a similar manner to American Graffiti and Scorsese's earlier Mean Streets, the songs served roughly the same purpose as a composed musical score. While an official soundtrack was released at the same time as the film, it only featured a small fraction of the songs used.Scorsese chose the songs for Goodfellas only if they commented on the scene or the characters 'in an oblique way'. The only rule he adhered to with the soundtrack was to only use music which could have been heard at that time.Scorsese decided that if a scene took place in the 1970s, he could use any song that was current or older. According to Scorsese, a lot of non-dialogue scenes were shot to playback. For example, he had 'Layla' playing on the set while shooting the scene where the dead bodies are discovered in the car and the meat-truck. Sometimes, the lyrics of songs were put between lines of dialogue to comment on the action.Some of the music Scorsese had written into the script while other songs he discovered during the editing phase.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story (soundtrack)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story is the soundtrack album to the 2016 Hindi-language film of the same name directed by Neeraj Pandey. Based on the life of former Indian cricketer MS Dhoni, the film stars Sushant Singh Rajput as Dhoni along with Disha Patani, Kiara Advani, and Anupam Kher in pivotal roles. The album consists of nine songs composed by Amaal Mallik in his first album as a solo composer, with one song being composed by Rochak Kohli as a guest composer, featuring lyrics written by Manoj Muntashir. The vocals were performed by Armaan Malik, Arijit Singh, Siddharth Basrur, Rochak Kohli, Palak Muchhal, Ananya Nanda and Adithyan A. Prithviraj. The background music was composed by Sanjoy Chowdhury.The album was recorded entirely using live instrumentation and has only one soundscape used considering the theme of the film. After M. M. Kreem, whom collaborated with Pandey for the soundtracks: Special 26 and Baby, refused his offer on his priorities with Baahubali: The Beginning (the first film in Rajamouli's Baahubali franchise) despite composing one promotional single, Pandey chose Amaal Malik for the film soundtrack and initially recorded six songs within March—October 2015. No lip-syncing is used in the songs, as the team believed that the songs blend in the narrative. The album released in Tamil, Telugu and Marathi with the lyrics were penned by Pa. Vijay, Chaitanya Prasad and Guru Thakur for the respective languages. Out of the seven songs, a promotional track 'Har Gully Mein Dhoni Hai' (also released in Tamil) and two alternate versions of the songs were used in Hindi version, while the Telugu and Marathi album have seven tracks.The album opened to positive reviews from critics, praising Amaal Malik for using single soundscape and retaining the freshness and melody in the tracks, but criticised for the familiarity of the tunes. The tracks 'Besabriyaan', 'Kaun Tujhe', 'Phir Kabhi' and 'Har Gully Mein Dhoni Hai' received the most consumer response and Palak Muchhal, the singer of 'Kaun Tujhe' received a News18 and Screen Award for Best Female Playback Singer respectively.ProductionInitially Neeraj Pandey planned to rope in M. M. Kreem as the composer for the film's soundtrack, after whom the director worked with him in Special 26 (2013) and Baby (2015). Kreem also composed the promotional track 'Phir Se' written by Manoj Muntashir and recorded by Divya Kumar, for the 2015 Cricket World Cup and dedicated the song to the Indian cricket team. Pandey being a cricket buff said that the idea was 'to sum up the mood and emotion for the entire nation' and called the song as a 'tribute to the inherent passion our players have for the country and the love we have towards our own team'. Both the director and the composer worked on the song and video in short span of time so as to release the track before the tournament which begins on 14 February 2015. The song received overwhelmingly positive response and Pandey eventually planned to rope Kreem as the composer. But, Kreem's commitments on Baahubali franchise led Pandey to choose a different composer for the songs. When Pandey listened to the song 'Sooraj Dooba Hain' from the film Roy (2015), Pandey eventually approached the composer of the song, Amaal Malik to work for the biopic's songs along with Bhushan Kumar, the chairman and managing director of T-Series. Malik had eventually composed two single songs for the label —'Chal Wahan Jaate Hain' and 'Zindagi Aa Raha Hoon Main' — both of them featured Tiger Shroff as the lead.Amaal Malik composed 25 songs in his film career when he was being a part of multi-composer soundtracks for films, but this was his first album as a solo composer. Initially, the team had planned for a multi-composer setup for the songs in the film, but as Amaal Malik composed the first track 'Besabriyaan', the team decided to retain him as the composer for the soundtrack. Within October 2015, Malik finished composing six tracks for the film's soundtrack with three of them being romantic numbers which highlighted Dhoni's relationship with his wife Sakshi Dhoni, from the time they first meet to post marriage. Bhushan made Malik sit for nights explaining him the feel and requirement of each song in the film. The album does not have the characters lip-syncing to the songs but will play in the background as they wanted the score to complement the cricketer's image and the album was further recorded with live instruments.Malik said that the seven songs have 'fine blend of rock and orchestral elements'. He explained that 'The album maintains a balance between commercial and the inspirational aspect, even if one has not seen the movie, they would still be able to relate to the songs, which is why the songs work as stand-alone tracks'; also adding that the album maintains a single sort of soundscape, which he called as the 'most difficult to crack', calling the film as 'one of his toughest projects in his career'.Album informationThe track 'Besabriyaan' which was the first to be composed which is about Dhoni's early life that how he juggled between studies and cricket simultaneously. The second song 'Kaun Tujhe' is about the relationship with his late girlfriend Priyanka Jha, who died in a tragic accident in 2002. The third song from the film entitled 'Jab Tak' is about Dhoni's first meeting with his wife Sakshi in the film. Rochak Kohli was announced as the guest composer for the film's soundtrack and composed a promotional single titled 'Har Gully Mein Dhoni Hai' which is about the craze of cricket in India and public opinion about the sport. It was initially started as the theme of street cricket in India, but Kohli described the song as 'a tribute to dreams and the fight to achieve the dreams'. He further described the song as 'a metaphor for everyone in India who has the potential to rise above their immediate realities to achieve them' and as 'an emotional song that connects to everyone, in every by-lane of the country, with the hope and passion to succeed'. This song was released in Tamil as 'Ulagam Engum Dhoni Ye' sung by S. P. Charan and lyrics written by Pa. Vijay. However, it was not featured in the Telugu and Marathi versions of the soundtracks. The promotional song 'Phir Se' which was made by M. M. Kreem for the 2015 Cricket World Cup was not included in the film.ReceptionWriting for The Times of India, Rinky Kumar gave the soundtrack album a rating 3 out of 5 adding: 'the album has a mixed bag of tracks, some of which make quite an impression and while others are nothing to write home about'. Surabhi Redkar of Koimoi also rated 3 out of 5, calling the album as 'quite decent' and praised Amaal Malik for a 'great effort in his first solo album'. Writing for India Today, Devarsi Ghosh added that: 'the album has a few stock market-friendly hit-gaana type numbers, every once in a while, Amaal tries to move away from monotony and do something interesting'. Critic based at Daily News and Analysis praised Amaal Malik for the use of live instruments in the film's soundtrack, calling it as 'a more full-blooded feel', and further added that 'the album has a couple of snags, but that could not stop the album's winning inning'.Joginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama rated the album 4.5 out of 5 saying 'The music of M.S. Dhoni is good and there is nothing unlikeable about it. Though one doesn't expect the music to become chartbuster from a long term musical experience, in the context of the film most of them should fit in well.' Devesh Sharma of Filmfare gave a 4 out of 5 rating to the soundtrack saying 'Amaal Mallik makes his mark as a solo music director'. A critic from India.com said that 'there is some not-so-wow kind of songs too, but the album will still be liked – thanks to the soft romantic tracks'. Manish Gaekwad of Scroll.in called that 'Mallik has a hit strike rate with the mushy numbers, but he has his work cut out for him if he wants to diversify into other styles'. Critic Gaurang Chauhan of BollywoodLife.com said that the album has 'quite a few hummable tunes to it' and called the album as a 'must listen for all the romantic hearts'. A critic from Behindwoods gave the album 3 out of 5 calling it as 'an impressive album which stays perfectly true to the film's genre'. Vipin Nair of Music Aloud criticised the soundtrack saying it as 'the album is largely marred by the familiarity in its tunes', with a rating of 2.5 out of 5. Megha Mathur of The Quint opined that 'Amaal Mallik's compositions are not as dynamic or disruptive as the film's protagonist, despite few long lasting melodies'. She further called that 'The OST falls short of making the biopic a spectacular experience'.Track listingHindiTamilTeluguMarathiRelease historyChart performanceWeekly chartsYear-end chartsAccoladesPersonnelCredits adapted from CD liner notesAmaal Mallik – Composer (All tracks), musical arrangements (All tracks)Meghdeep Bose – Music producer (Track 1,2,3,10), acoustic guitar (Track 1,2,10)Sourav Roy – Music producer (Track 4)Keshav Dhar – Music producer (Track 5), electric guitar (Track 5)Ankur Mukherjee – Music producer (Track 5), acoustic guitar (Track 1,2,6,10), live guitar (Track 4), ukulele (Track 4)Jim Sathya – Music producer (Track 6)Aditya Dev – Music producer (Track 7)Rochak Kohli – Music producer (Track 8)Joell Mukherji – Music producer (Track 9), acoustic guitar (Track 9), electric guitar (Track 9)Armaan Malik – Acoustic guitar (Track 4), electric guitar (Track 5)Dev Arijit – Acoustic guitar (Track 8)Mohit Dogra – Acoustic guitar (Track 8)Rushad Mistry – Bass guitar (Track 1,6)Jeeni Dutta – Electric guitar (Track 5)Jai Row Kavi – Drums (Track 5)Sivamani – Drums (Track 8), percussions (Track 8)Firoz Khan – Keys (Track 8)Krishna Jhaveri – Bass (Track 5)Omkar Dhumal – Shehnai (Track 7)Tejas Vinchurkar – Flute (Track 1,2,10), Woodwinds (Track 1)Suresh Lalwani – Strings (CMA Musicians, Mumbai) [Track 1,3]Dipesh Varma – Live rhythm (Track 7), live percussions (Track 7)Daboo Malik – Live rhythm (Track 7), live percussions (Track 7)Omkar Salunkhe – Live rhythm (Track 7)Keyur Barve – Live rhythm (Track 7)Amey Londhe – Vocal recording (Audio Garage, Mumbai) [Track 1,5]Vincent Joseph – Vocal recording (Audio Garage, Mumbai) [Track 1,5]Surajit Ghoshmazumdar – Vocal recording (T-Series Studios, Mumbai) [Track 2]Rahul Sharma – Vocal recording (Asia Music Vision, Mumbai) [Track 4]Akshay Kamat – Vocal recording (RK Music Labs, Mumbai) [Track 8], music assistanceVijay Dayal – Live instrumentation recording (YRF Studios, Mumbai) [Track 1,2,6,10], vocal recording (YRF Studios, Mumbai) [Track 3,6,10]Chinmay Mestry – Live instrumentation recording (YRF Studios, Mumbai) [Track 1,2,6,10], vocal recording (YRF Studios, Mumbai) [Track 3,6,10]Shantanu Hudlikar – Live instrumentation recording (YRF Studios, Mumbai) [Track 1,3,5]Abhishek Khandelwal – Live instrumentation recording (YRF Studios, Mumbai) [Track 1,3,5]Manasi Tare – Live instrumentation recording (YRF Studios, Mumbai) [Track 1,3,5]Julian Mascarenhas – Live instrumentation recording (Enzy Studios, Mumbai) [Track 4,8]Eric Pillai – Audio mixing (Future Sound of Bombay, Mumbai) [All tracks], mastering (Future Sound of Bombay, Mumbai) [All tracks]Bharat Goel – Audio mixing (Global Sound Labs, Mumbai) [Track 8], mastering (Global Sound Labs, Mumbai) [Track 8]Ninad Lad – Audio mixing (Orbis Studio, Mumbai) [Track 9], live instrumentation recording (Orbis Studio, Mumbai) [Track 9]Donal Whelan – Audio mastering (Mastering World, London) [Track 9]Michael Edwin Pillai – Mixing assistance (Future Sound of Bombay, Mumbai)Shayan Chakraborty – Mixing assistance (Orbis Studio, Mumbai)Krish Trivedi – Music assistanceSid 'Sky' Singh – Music assistanceYash Narvekar – Music assistanceZaid Patni – Music assistanceShishir A Samant – Music assistanceGaurav Sanghvi – Music assistanceAnvay Patil – Music assistanceRujul Deolikar – Music assistanceNotesReferencesExternal links2016 soundtrack albums Hindi film soundtracks Tamil film soundtracks Telugu film soundtracks T-Series (company) soundtrack albums Sports film soundtracks Biographical film soundtracks", "machine_text": "M.S.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"A Fable for Critics\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "A Fable for Critics is a book-length satirical poem by American writer James Russell Lowell, first published anonymously in 1848. The poem made fun of well-known poets and critics of the time and brought notoriety to its author.Overview A Fable for Critics satirized many of the most important figures in American literature at the time, including Ralph Waldo Emerson and James Fenimore Cooper. Many of his harshest judgments were aimed at names that have not survived in posterity, including Nathaniel Parker Willis, Cornelius Mathews, Fitz-Greene Halleck, and John Neal. He gave ample praise to Charles Frederick Briggs and Lydia Maria Child, though he was friends with both and likely allowed his friendship to inflate his assessment of their talents. Of Edgar Allan Poe, he said he was 'three-fifths genius... and two-fifths sheer fudge'. Lowell included himself as well, referring to himself as having difficulty determining the difference ''twixt singing and preaching'. Many of the poetic portraits were balanced with praise, as in Halleck's: Halleck's better, I doubt not, than all he has written; In his verse a clear glimpse you will frequently find If not of a great, of a fortunate mindLowell's most vicious treatment was aimed at Margaret Fuller, whom he referred to as Miranda. At first, he intended to exclude her entirely but thought doing so would be more insulting and was convinced to write 'a line or two' by his wife Maria White Lowell. Ultimately, his characterization was the only which was wholly negative and not balanced with praise. He suggested that she stole old ideas and presented them as her own and that she was only genuine when being spiteful.Publication historyA Fable for Critics, with the subtitle 'A Glance at a Few of Our Literary Progenies', was published anonymously as a pamphlet early in 1848. Three thousand copies were sold in short order. Lowell had hoped there would be sufficient profit from his sales, which he intended to turn over to his financially struggling friend Briggs, though it was said the profit was only enough to purchase one small silver plate. The poem was reprinted several times with Lowell's name after its initial publication. One version included an introductory note explaining its author's intentions: 'This jeu d'esprit was extemporized, I may fairly say, so rapidly was it written, purely for my own amusement and with no thought of publication' until convinced to do so by Briggs.Critical response Ultimately, A Fable for Critics earned Lowell notoriety as a poet, once his name was revealed, though he did not significantly profit from its publication. Lowell's early biographer Horace Scudder said A Fable for Critics was quickly overshadowed by the publication of The Biglow Papers, another satire by Lowell featuring a folksy character named Hosea Biglow which was published almost immediately following A Fable for Critics. Charles Briggs predicted as much in a letter to Lowell in which he said, 'I am pretty confident that the 'Fable' will suit the market for which it is intended, unless it should be killed by Hosea, who will help to divert public attention from his own kind'.John Ruskin labeled the poem 'in animal spirit and power... almost beyond anything I know'. Oliver Wendell Holmes found it 'capital—crammed full and rammed down hard—with powder (lots of it)—shot—slugs—very little wadding... all crowded into a rusty-looking sort of blunderbuss barrel, as it were—capped with a percussion preface—and cocked with a title page as apropos as a wink to a joke'. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow compared it to Lord Byron's 'English Bards' as being 'full of wild wit and deviltry, and amazingly clever'. Freeman Hunt reviewed the poem for Merchants' Magazine in December 1848 and remarked on how true the character assessments were: 'Our friends Bryant, Halleck, Willis, Whittier, Poe, and last but not least, Harry Franco, (Briggs,) are, in our judgment, as genuine life pictures as were ever sketched with pen or pencil, in prose or verse. The severity, if any, is lost in the general fidelity of the delineations.'Lowell's friends objected to the intense criticism of Fuller, specifically William Wetmore Story and Thomas Wentworth Higginson. Edgar Allan Poe reviewed the work in the Southern Literary Messenger and called it ''loose'—ill-conceived and feebly executed, as well in detail as in general... we confess some surprise at his putting forth so unpolished a performance'. His final judgment was that the work was not successful: 'no failure was ever more complete or more pitiable'.In 1922, Amy Lowell, a later relative of the Lowell family, wrote a similar book which she titled A Critical Fable after she was lampooned by Robert Frost. In it, she pokes fun at contemporary poets like Frost, Ezra Pound, and T. S. Eliot using the byline 'A Poker of Fun'. In the younger Lowell's version, the satire presents two people in conversation, including Lowell himself and a present-day critic. The critic particularly defends women poets against the elder Lowell's disdain for them and instead saves their harshest criticism for male writers.NotesReferences Duberman, Martin.

The poem was first published in 1848 and is considered to be one of Lowell's most famous works. The poem takes the form of a conversation between several notable literary figures of the time, including Ralph Waldo Emerson, John Greenleaf Whittier, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and Edgar Allan Poe. Lowell uses this framework to offer his critiques and opinions on the literary scene of the mid-19th century. The poem is notable for its use of humor and sarcasm, as well as its unapologetic criticism of Lowell's contemporaries. He praises Emerson's originality and thoughtfulness, while criticizing Longfellow for being too sentimental and Whittier for being too preachy. Poe, who was often the target of Lowell's criticism, is portrayed as a brilliant but flawed figure. Despite its criticism of specific individuals, 'A Fable for Critics' is also a commentary on the state of American literature in the mid-19th century. Lowell was part of the Transcendentalist movement, which emphasized individualism and spirituality. The poem reflects the movement's desire for American writers to break away from European literary traditions and establish their own unique style. The poem was well-received by Lowell's contemporaries, many of whom appreciated his humor and willingness to critique his peers. It remains an influential work in American literature, and is often studied for its insights into mid-19th century literary culture.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 18850823}

Commonly known as Tun Wan Ahmad before his accession, he seized the throne in 1863 after having defeated his elder brother Tun Mutahir in the Pahang Civil War, assuming the title Sri Paduka Dato' Bendahara Siwa Raja Tun Ahmad. In the early years of his reign, Pahang descended into turmoil, with various attempts made by the surviving sons of the late Tun Mutahir, based in Selangor, to overthrow him. This led to Pahang's decisive involvement in the Selangor Civil War that successfully brought it to a conclusive end.The successive wars that ravaged the land had led to the rise of dissension among the ruling class and territorial chiefs who were thenceforth divided into factions. In 1881, prompted by his dwindling authority both within Pahang and among his counterparts in the western Malay states, Tun Wan Ahmad took upon the title of Sultan Ahmad al-Muadzam Shah and formally proclaimed as Sultan by his chiefs two years later. The event marked the revival of Pahang as a Sultanate after more than two centuries of union with the crown of Johor. Ahmad gained formal recognition from the British Straits Settlements government in 1887, in return for signing a treaty with the British which compelled him to accept a British Agent in his court.During his reign, Pahang politics came under the purview of the British government. Increasing pressure was exerted upon the Sultan by the residing British Agent to administer the state according to the British ideals of just rule and modernisation. This had effectively plunged the state into a seething cauldron of discontent with clashes between traditional chiefs and the British. The British ultimately compelled Tun Wan Ahmad to put his state under the British protectorate in 1888 and John Pickersgill Rodger was appointed Pahang's first Resident. The work of building up a State administration began with the creation of the Supreme Court, a police force and a State Council. In 1895, the Sultan entered into a Treaty of Federation to form the Federated Malay States. Tun Wan Ahmad transferred his executive and administrative powers to his eldest son Tengku Long Mahmud, due to old age in 1909, retaining his position and titles as Head of State until his death in 1914.Early life On 23 May 1836 at Pulau Maulana, Pekan, Che Puan Long, a wife of the 22nd Bendahara of Johor Empire, Tun Ali, gave birth to a son Wan Ahmad, for whom an Arab, Habib Abdullah ibni Omar Al-Attas foretold a great future. Wan Ahmad is the patrilineal descendant of the 13th Bendahara who was proclaimed as the 10th Sultan of Johor, Abdul Jalil Shah IV. After the accession Abdul Jalil, Pahang was made the special province of the Bendaharas, who ruled the state as the vassal of the Johor empire. However, during the reign of Tun Abdul Majid, with the gradual dismemberment of the empire, Pahang status was changed from a provincial state (Tanah Pegangan) to a fiefdom (Tanah Kurnia), thus the reigning Bendahara assumed the title Raja Bendahara ('king grand vizier'). It was not until 1853, when Pahang under the rule of his father, formally declared independence.Wan Ahmad was educated privately in his father's court, where many teachers of various degrees expounded to the royal family. He was granted Kuantan and Endau as his fief by his father when he was a very young at age, but opposed in his control of these territories by his brother, after the latter's succession in 1857.Civil warThe dispute over the territories of Kuantan and Endau prompted Wan Ahmad to oppose his brother in the supreme government. The tensions among the two brothers escalated into a bitter civil war, shortly after the death of their father in 1857. His elder brother, Tun Mutahir was supported by Johor to the south, and by the British Straits Settlements who were then opposing the Siamese Rattanakosin Kingdom. Wan Ahmad, 22 years old of age at that time, was helped by the Terengganu, a Malay sultanate to the north, and by the Siamese. Both sides, whose outside supporters had ulterior motives, engaged chiefly in raids and ambushes, with occasional battles near fortifications along the vast riverine system of Pahang. Siamese vessels sent to assist Wan Ahmad in 1862 were routed by the British warships. The war ceased soon after Wan Ahmad troops conquered and established control over a number of important towns and regions in the interior, and eventually seizing the capital, Pekan. Tun Mutahir retreated to Temai and in May 1863, he fled to Kuala Sedili, where he died with his son Wan Koris.Ahmad owed his victory in the war partly to his outstanding ability as a field commander. The victor was formally installed ruler by his chiefs with the title Bendahara Siwa Raja Tun Ahmad, thus ended the fratricidal struggle between the two brothers.

Born on April 25, 1710, in Rothiemay, Aberdeenshire, Ferguson was self-taught, having left school at a young age to work as a shepherd on his family's farm. His interest in astronomy and mechanics developed during his time as a shepherd, where he would spend his nights stargazing and tinkering with mechanical devices. Ferguson's curiosity eventually led him to Edinburgh, where he gained recognition for his mechanical inventions. He was particularly interested in the construction of telescopes and designed several reflecting telescopes of his own. In 1743, he published his astronomical work titled 'Astronomy Explained Upon Sir Isaac Newton's Principles,' which became widely popular and was translated into several languages. Ferguson's inventions and contributions to science were highly regarded, and he became a fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1763. He was also the first person to accurately describe the phenomenon of barometric 'capillarity,' which lead to the discovery of the 'Law of Capillary Attraction.' In addition to his achievements as an astronomer and mechanic, Ferguson was also interested in the field of hydrodynamics. He published several works on the topic, including his 1760 book 'An Essay on the Science of Mechanics,' which included his theory of the behavior of fluids.

The production of coins was a significant task during the reigns of the Roman emperors, who aimed to maintain control over the monetary system. The earliest Roman mints were established in the Republic era, around the 4th century BC. These mints were controlled by public officials such as Quaestors, who were primarily responsible for the production of bronze coins. Silver coins were later introduced, and they were produced in both Rome and various provincial cities. During the Imperial era, the Roman mints began to produce gold coins as well. Roman emperors put a great deal of effort into producing coins that were visually striking, and they often included their faces on them. These coins helped to promote their image and authority and also served as propaganda tools. Though the Latin term for the Roman mint was 'moneta,' the term 'mint' is still commonly used today to refer to the place where coins are produced. The Rome mint was located at different places throughout the city from time to time, including the Forum Romanum or near the Colosseum. The mints were operated by skilled craftsmen who were highly trained in the art of coin production. They had to take great care in ensuring that each coin was of the appropriate weight and size. They also had to ensure that the coins were made of the appropriate metal and that they were accurately stamped with the emperor's image. The Roman moneta was only one part of the Roman monetary system. The ancient Roman economy also relied on other forms of money, including copper bullion, silver bullion, and gold bullion. Today, Roman coins are highly sought after by collectors, and mints continue to produce coins all over the world. The Roman mints were instrumental in the development of the Roman Empire, and their impact is still felt today.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 60262771}

From 1926 on, he started working with photomontages, becoming one of the pioneers of this technique in the field of industrial design. Schuitema was a member of Nederlandsche Vereeniging voor Ambachts- en Nijverheidskunst (V.A.N.K.) the Dutch Association for Craft and Craft Art.Even though he was a convinced socialist and often designed leftist publications directed at industrial workers, Schuitema also worked for major companies, such as Philips.Post-war filmmaker During the final years of World War II, Schuitema, along with Jan Bouman, Lou Lichtveld and Eduard Verschueren, began planning for the post-war art community in the Netherlands. In 1944, the four publish a 'Report on Stimulation, Development and Organization of the Film Industry in the Netherlands' (Rapport inzake de stimuleering, ontwikkeling en ordening van het Filmwezen in Nederland).Following Dolle Dinsdag (5 September 1944), he officially joined the resistance forces, assuming a leadership role in the National Film and Photo Reportage Service. After the end of the war, Schuitema and his three partners founded the Dutch Cooperative for Film Production (Nederlandse Werkgemeenschap voor Filmproductie,NWF) in Haarlem and gave the impulse for the formation of the Dutch Film Makers Guild (Beroepsvereniging van Nederlandse Cineasten). In each case, membership was restricted to those artists whose conduct during the occupation was irreproachable.In 1946, Schuitema presented his short film 'Les Ponts de la Meuse' at the Cannes Film Festival.InfluenceHis techniques influenced the Wild Plakken design collective of the late 20th century.See alsoTypographicaLiterature Dick Maan, Paul Schuitema.

He was a prominent exponent of the Dutch avant-garde, known as De Stijl, and was a pioneer in the development of modern graphic design. Schuitema was born in Rotterdam and, after studying for a brief period at the Academy of Fine Arts in Rotterdam, worked as a typographer at a printing house. In 1923, he moved to The Hague and joined the De Stijl group, where he became a close collaborator of artists such as Piet Mondrian, Theo van Doesburg, and Vilmos Huszár. Schuitema was inspired by the De Stijl principles of abstraction, simplicity, and geometric purity, which he applied to his work as a graphic designer. Schuitema's designs were characterized by their clarity, precision, and economy of form. He experimented with photomontage, using photographic images and typography to create new visual languages. His work was influential in the development of the New Typography movement, which advocated for the use of sans-serif fonts, asymmetrical layouts, and clean lines in graphic design. Schuitema was also a pioneering photographer, using the camera as a tool for experimentation and abstraction. He explored the visual possibilities of industrial and urban landscapes, creating compositions of shapes, lines, and textures that highlighted the beauty of the everyday. His photographs were exhibited in major international exhibitions, including the influential Film und Foto exhibition in Stuttgart in 1929. After World War II, Schuitema continued working as a graphic designer, creating posters, logos, and visual identities for clients such as Philips, Heineken, and Shell. He also became a teacher, sharing his innovative ideas with a new generation of designers. His legacy continues to influence contemporary graphic design, and his work is held in major collections around the world.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 5207126}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Monis Rahman\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Monis Rahman is a Pakistani internet entrepreneur, venture capitalist and businessman. Rahman is the co-founder and executive chairman of Naseeb Networks, Inc. a business-oriented social network used primarily for online job recruiting.Rahman has been listed among the top entrepreneurs of 21st century several times. Forbes named him at #6 on its list of top 'Ten Big Hitting Asian Businessmen under 50'.CareerEarly years After completing his studies at Wisconsin, Rahman went to work at Intel. With the Intel team, he developed an Itanium microprocessor chip between 1991 and 1996 and left the job after looking at the dot-com bubble rise in order to start his own company. In 1997, Rahman and a partner started a company that installed cameras in daycare centers, allowing parents to watch the video streams online in real time. Edaycare.com attracted 2.5 million from investors, including Ron Conway, an early stage investor of Google and PayPal. A year later Rahman and his partner ran out of money, forcing them to sell the company for stock that was beneficially worthless.Naseeb Networks, Inc. After a hiatus of four years and working as a consultant, Rahman decided to start a social networking site for Muslims in the United States and United Kingdom, after looking at the success of similar website Friendster.com. He named it 'Naseeb.com' (meaning 'destiny'). Built as a social site, it was considered more of match-making portal, but Rahman said, 'I decided not to go head-on as a matchmaking site... 'Dating' has a negative stigma from a Muslim viewpoint.' Naseeb.com was then invested in by LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman with25,000, while Mark Pincus of Zynga and Joe Kraus of Excite also stepped in as angel investors.Describing the inspiration behind Naseeb, Rahman said, 'I was exploring the Pakistani market since my family had moved here. I realized that the biggest cost in running a web company was of human capital. And the running cost in Pakistan would have been 1/18th of what it would have been in the US. So that's when I decided to come back and start Naseeb.com, which exploded very quickly. We were the first one to be doing any kind of serious business on the internet back then. And we had little to no competition in the market.'In 2002, Rahman returned to Pakistan and registered his company as Naseeb Networks, Inc., both in Lahore, Pakistan, and in San Jose, California, US, to make it easier to raise money and investors. He spent 60,000 as a startup cost for Naseeb and initially handled the company on his own. To prime the market, he used equity in the company to buy the electronic greeting card site eidmubarak.com, which allow Muslims to send cards for Eid, a Muslim holiday. Three thousand people from the site's 1-million-strong mailing list signed up immediately. Annual memberships cost40, and by 2005 the website was generating 300,000 in revenue.With the expansion of company Rahman needed programmers and developers, and buying ads in local newspapers was expensive. He recalls, 'I started Naseeb.com from my house, but later moved out as we grew. Now when hiring, I ran into a lot of problems finding the right talent. At that time, one job ad in the classified section in Dawn News, roughly cost PKR 850,000 which was ridiculous! So I decided to put my ads online.'Rozee.pkIn 2005, Rahman built a 'quick and dirty' job site to post job openings for his parent company Naseeb Networks. Many other companies contacted Rahman to post their companies' and products' ads on his website. Rahman agreed to post their ads free of cost to help boost Naseeb's traffic. After receiving such a reception, the website became the primary business of Naseeb Networks.Rahman then offered the largest companies the ability to search for résumés, as well as software to power their own companys' job boards and the right to post their logos on the front page of his new site. He named it 'Rozee', an Urdu language word which means 'livelihood', or translates roughly as 'blessed livelihood.'In 2007 Rozee.pk went into a completely functioning state, generating more traffic than Naseeb. Rahman used Naseeb's proceeds, and2 million from Draper Fisher Jurvetson and ePlanet Ventures, to hire salespeople to go after large corporate clients, most of which still advertised job openings in newspapers. More than 63 000 companies actively post openings on Rozee.pk, paying between 29 for a single ad and up to20,000 for a suite of services.Rozee.pk has been listed as the number one employment website in Pakistan, with more than 65 thousand companies posting jobs, 32.53 million applications processed and 6 million unique visitors every day. In 2015, Rozee.pk won 6.5 million of investment from Vostok Nafta and Piton Capital, bringing the company's total venture capital funding to8.5 million.In an interview Rahman stated, 'As talent continues to move online at a rapid pace in emerging markets, businesses need increasingly sophisticated recruiting technology customized to nuanced local market dynamics.'It was the latest in a series of large venture capital investments in Pakistan over the previous year and a half. Managing director Per Brilioth said, 'We are excited to partner with Naseeb Networks and impressed with what Rahman and his team have achieved in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia... We believe these markets present massive growth opportunities and are looking forward to working with the team to expand the reach of Naseeb Networks' world-class products and services.' Michael Porter of AllWorld Network listed the company as one of Pakistan's fastest growing private companies. American writer Elmira Bayrasli visited Pakistan in 2010 to assess the entrepreneurial potential of the country and listed Rahman as an 'example to entrepreneurs' in her 2015 book, From the Other Side of the World. She claimed that the 'next Silicon Valley could be in Lahore, Mumbai or Istanbul.'Chalo.pk In 2011, Rahman launched a location-based online shopping portal that features 'local daily deals and listings for the most affordable things to do, place to eat, and brands to buy' in cities throughout Pakistan. Rahman said, 'Chalo is my experiment. We have hundreds of SMEs in Pakistan who can't afford to promote themselves on large platforms like newspapers, billboards, TV etc. We're helping them expandgrow through Chalo.pk... We're also experimenting with Maps. We spent 2 years building our own maps database, and now we have mapped every single house address in any planned society in Lahore. We’ve also mapped all the restaurants, their menus and other details in the app. So people can navigate to them really easily. If you want to watch a movie, we're listing all the movies being shown in all the cities, and soon we'll be adding a Buy button.'Digital Publishers Association of Pakistan In 2012, Rahman co-founded the Digital Publishers Association of Pakistan (DPAP), with several publications and portal owners including Masood Hamid (President), Monis Rahman (Vice President), Sarmad A. Ali (Member Executive Committee), Lucas Peter (Secretary General), Imran Ansari (Joint Secretary), Qudratullah Shahab (Member Executive Committee), and Sarah Sohail (Finance Secretary). The association aims to 'safeguard interests of all stakeholders in the burgeoning digital market and create a regulated playing field.'Mihnati.com acquisition In 2013, Rozee.pk bought Saudi employment website Mihnati.com for an undisclosed amount. Discussing the acquisition, Rahman said, 'We have merged both Rozee.pk and Mihnati by migrating all Mihnati employers and jobseekers on to the Rozee.pk technology platform. By doing this, we gave our Saudi sales team a far more powerful product to sell with more features.'Other works and future ventures After establishing himself, Rahman served as a head or partner of several technology firms in Pakistan, including as a member of the board of directors at Kashf Microfinance Bank Limited(2010-2012), and of the Pakistan Advisory Board at Acumen Fund (2010-2013). Currently he is a member of the Young Presidents' Organization (2010) Governing Board (CEC) at Pakistan Software Houses Association for IT and ITES (P@SHA) (2013), Secretary General and founding member at Digital Publishers Association of Pakistan (DPAP), and a member of the Global Board of Trustees (BoT) at The Indus Entrepreneurs (TiE, Lahore) (2012).Rahman is regarded as one of the best entrepreneurs of the country. Many have listed him in their top ten lists of CEOs and entrepreneurs. In 2016, Rahman was listed among the top CEOs of Pakistan, was placed at No. 6 among the Top 10 Most Influential Tech Leaders of Pakistan, and was ranked at #3 among the 'Top 5 E-commerce Business Tycoons of Pakistan'. Rahman is a TED speaker and is frequently invited to talk on entrepreneurship and Internet marketing at the world's top business schools and conferences.In 2016, Rahman together with Qasif Shahid developed a digital mobile wallet to increase digital payments' scale rapidly. The mobile wallet is telco, bank and handset agnostic with the philosophy of inter-operating collaboratively with existing payment plumbing. It is jointly funded by Finca Microfinance Bank and the e-company Finja. In an interview Qasif said, 'We believe banking products should look more like social networks than conventional banking products.'Rahman said, 'Our mobile wallet's open API platform will allow much needed collaborative creativity from other FinTechs to be leveraged to create building blocks for a wider array of useful financial products.'Awards and honors2008: International Data Group CIO Pakistan Pioneer in Innovation Award2011: Forbes 'Ten Big Hitting Asian Businessmen under 50'2012: Pakistan Power 100 Excellence AwardReferencesExternal linksRahman's profile at Rozee.pkRahman at Naseeb Networks, Inc.Living people Businesspeople in computing Pakistani computer businesspeople Stanford University alumni University of Wisconsin–Madison alumni Pakistani expatriates in Saudi Arabia Pakistani expatriates in the United States Pakistani venture capitalists Silicon Valley people Pakistani company founders Businesspeople from Lahore Year of birth missing (living people)", "machine_text": "Monis Rahman is a Pakistani entrepreneur and the founder of Rozee.pk, the country's leading job portal.

The Provincial Secretary was the equivalent of the former Canadian Cabinet position of Secretary of State for Canada. Like its federal counterpart it included an eclectic variety of responsibilities that were not assigned to other ministers, most of which would eventually evolve into portfolios of their own. The provincial secretary was also responsible for official communications between the provincial government and the Colonial Office in London as well as with other provincial and colonial governments (and after 1867 the federal government). As well, the position also included various duties related to ceremonial occasions, visits by dignitaries, protocol, relations between the government and the office of lieutenant governor and commemorative events particularly in relation to the monarchy.Generally, the Provincial Secretary acted as a province's Registrar-General and was responsible for formal documents and records such as licences, birth and death certificates, land registries and surveys, business registrations and writs. As well, the position was generally responsible for the administration of the civil service and of elections. Provincial secretaries were usually the most senior member of the provincial cabinet outside of the Premier, and the office holder was often designated as Acting Premier when the Premier was out of province, ill or otherwise unavailable. The last individual to hold the position of Provincial Secretary and Registrar (renamed Provincial Secretary and Minister of Citizenship in 1961) was John Yaremko who left office in 1975.In 1972 the Progressive Conservative government of Bill Davis adopted the provincial secretary title for a non-departmental cabinet portfolio in which the occupant either having responsibility spreading over several ministries, assisting a senior minister in an area or as a secondary portfolio for a senior minister giving him a broader responsibility or mandate area. The three positions created were Provincial Secretary for Social Development, Provincial Secretary for Justice and Provincial Secretary for Resource Development. These positions were unrelated to the original Provincial Secretary position except for the common name. The positions were retained by Davis' successor, Frank Miller, in 1985 but were abolished when the Progressive Conservatives lost power to David Peterson's Liberals in 1985.Pre-Confederation Provincial Secretary Prior to Confederation and the creation of the office of Premier, the Provincial Secretary was the most important and powerful figure in provincial politics.

Originally a narrow-gauge railway from 1916 to 1933, the Dominion Timber and Minerals Railway expanded to include a 65-ton locomotive and several freight cars.Due to rising operating costs and decreasing sustainability, the railway was decommissioned in 1981, with many of the railway ties being dumped into lakes along the route by workmen.

The company played a significant role in the economic development of the province as it provided an efficient transportation system for the forestry and mining industries. The company was founded on January 1, 1894, and was owned by the Dominion Coal Company and the Dominion Iron and Steel Company. The railway line stretched from Yarmouth in the south to the Annapolis Valley in the north, with branches to the mining areas in the Sydney and Glace Bay regions. One of the notable features of the Dominion Atlantic Railway was the use of standard gauge track, which made it possible to connect with other railways and the port of Halifax. The railway had a well-established passenger service, with trains running from Halifax to Yarmouth and on to Saint John, New Brunswick. The company faced many challenges during its operation, including financial difficulties and damage caused by natural disasters such as floods and hurricanes. In 1917, the railway was taken over by the Canadian Government Railways due to financial difficulties. This resulted in major changes to the structure and operation of the railway. After several ownership changes and mergers, the Dominion Atlantic Railway was finally absorbed by the Canadian National Railway in 1994. The DAR's legacy can be seen in the numerous abandoned rail lines that are still visible throughout Nova Scotia. In addition to being an essential transportation system for the forestry and mining industries, the Dominion Atlantic Railway played a vital role in the social and economic development of Nova Scotia. It transported goods and people, facilitated trade and commerce, and provided access to remote regions of the province.

She arrived Shanghai, on 1 December and later that month assisted the Korean Government in the prevention of smuggling. She continued operations in Far Eastern waters until returning to San Diego on 22 June 1947. For the next 14 months Hollister engaged in training exercises and fleet maneuvers along the West Coast.Hollister departed on 1 September 1948 for her second deployment in the western Pacific where she joined the 7th Fleet on peacekeeping operations. She returned to Long Beach on 24 April 1949 and operated in California waters until July 1950.Korean WarImmediately after North Korea invaded South Korea in June 1950, the United States committed its military might to halting aggression. Hollister was among the first reinforcements rushed to the battle area, departing San Diego on 5 July. Operating with Fast Carrier Task Force 77 (TF 77), she served as a screening ship and performed plane guard duty. In mid-September Hollister engaged in support of the highly successful landing at Inchon.The 3d Battalion, 5th Marines landed at 06:33, 15 September. Later that day General Douglas MacArthur praised the performance saying that 'The Navy and Marines have never shone more brightly than this morning.' A week later Hollister took Rear Admiral Ewen (TF-77) for a conference with Commander 7th Fleet. In a message to his command, Admiral Ewen echoed MacArthur in praising its work: 'The performance of Task Force 77 throughout the Inchon operations has added another page to the glorious history of our Navy and its airpower. It has been made possible only through the determination, the relentless effort and the esprit de corps of a team that is really great. Task Force 77 will sail for the high seas soon and will stay at sea until the North Korean Communists have their bellies full ...' In late September the destroyer was detached for diversionary bombardment in Communist-held areas, effectively weakening enemy positions as American forces smashed north.In early November 1950, Hollister sailed with the Formosa Straits patrol, returning to Korea in mid-December for support of the Hŭngnam evacuation. She continued support operations, anti-junk patrols and shore bombardment before returning to San Diego on 11 April 1951. Hollister operated in the San Diego area until she returned to Korean action a year later. In late April 1955, she resumed duties with Task Force 77, including fire-support missions, patrol, antisubmarine warfare (ASW) exercises and screening duty. Hollister joined the Formosa patrol in August, but resumed operations in Korea before returning to San Diego on 18 November.The veteran ship operated out of San Diego until 21 July 1953 when she sailed for another Far Eastern tour. Hollister engaged in patrols both off Korea and Formosa to make clear America's objective of protecting her allies. After six months in this area she returned home on 19 February 1954. In September, she was deployed to the Western Pacific at a time when the Chinese Communists were stirring trouble in the South China Sea. During the next three months she engaged in hunter-killer operations off Japan and had patrol duty in the South China Sea. In late January 1955, Hollister accompanied the 7th Fleet in the evacuation of Chinese Nationalists from the Tachen Islands. Constant aerial coverage from this powerful carrier force enabled the Nationalists to move from an untenable position. This was considered by some as 'the most forthright U.S. action against communism since the Korean War.' She returned to San Diego on 13 March for local operations.Another deployment to the Far East from 27 September 1955 to 11 March 1956, saw Hollister resume her important peace keeping operations in this explosive area. Only six months passed before departing on another tour of duty with the 7th Fleet, this time visiting Samoa, New Zealand, Manus, and Guam en route to the South China Sea. In January and February 1957, she operated with the Formosa Patrol and conducted training out of Japan before returning to San Diego 24 March.Hollister deployed on 25 October on her ninth Western Pacific tour. In the early months of 1958 she operated with units of the 7th Fleet on Formosa Patrol. Units in this area were placed on alert as a crisis in Indonesia threatened the existing government. The presence of U.S. seapower exerted a powerful influence; the crisis subsided. The destroyer returned to San Diego 23 April but sailed again for the Western Pacific on 18 December to operate with the 7th Fleet. Returning San Diego on 13 June 1959, Hollister spent the remainder of the year engaged in tactical exercises out of San Diego.Hollister departed on 6 February 1960 for her 11th Western Pacific deployment and began patrol duty in the Formosa Straits. This tour of duty also saw her engaged in various antisubmarine warfare exercises with the Philippine Navy. She returned to San Diego on 14 June to resume training and readiness operations.Hollister entered the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard on 15 March 1961 for FRAM (Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization) overhaul, remaining there through the end of the year for an addition of a helicopter deck and hangar aft. After refresher training, she departed Long Beach, California on 7 June 1962 for duty with the 7th Fleet. This cruise came after the Laos crisis and Communist insurgency threatened Thailand.She remained in the Far East until 21 December 1962 when she returned to Long Beach. During 1963 Hollister engaged in shore bombardment exercises and antisubmarine training off the coast of California and in Hawaii water.In the first half of 1964, Hollister engaged in antisubmarine exercises on the American West Coast. On 19 June, she departed Long Beach, California, with an antisubmarine group bound for Pearl Harbor, arriving on 27 June. After passage to Japan, she took up a station for contingency operations in the South China Sea on 4 August, and received the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal for her patrol services off Vietnam. After continuing these operations intermittently until 17 November, Hollister began transit from Yokosuka, Japan, to Long Beach on 23 December, arriving on 6 January 1965.With three months of overhaul complete, the ship engaged in continuous training exercises from 28 May to 20 August. Deploying again to the western Pacific in August, Hollister was ordered to Taiwan Patrol duty on 14 September.Vietnam WarBy 22 September, she returned to Subic Bay, Philippine Islands, to commence plane guard and anti-submarine screen duties supporting . Hollister accompanied the aircraft carrier on 'Yankee Station' off Vietnam, giving valuable support to the naval operations exercised in opposing the North Vietnamese Communists.On 19 December she left the station and arrived in Yokosuka on 30 December, prior to her departure for the United States the following day.After a six-month repair and training period, Hollister left Long Beach on 25 June for the Far East once again. Arriving on 15 July, she screened carriers and prevented infiltration of supplies to the Viet Cong. Hollister remained in the Far East, where she was on station in May 1967.After completing a Fleet in-depth overhaul in 1972, Hollister again departed Homeport, this time for her eighteenth deployment to the Western Pacific, carrying a new missile configuration. On 10 August 1972 Hollister became the first U.S. Naval Vessel to ever fire a Surface-to-Surface missile in anger. The missile silenced a North Vietnam Radar site. Only a day before, while on a three ship daylight raid on the Quang Yien storage complex, Hollister received at least 250 rounds of hostile fire. The Task unit destroyed a huge ammunition cache with Hollister returning 193 rounds of fire against enemy shore batteries on the heavily fortified island of Hon Me. This was considered the most daring Destroyer operation of the Vietnam War. The target was destroyed and the Task Unit retired without damage or a single casualty.Hollister returned from the Western Pacific for the last time in February 1973. Hollister's record included completing 21 Western Pacific deployments and action in two major conflicts.In September 1973 'Hollister' was entered into the Reserve Fleet unit Desron 27, NAVSUPACT, Long Beach, California, with four other ships, the USS McKean DD784, USS Higbee DD806, USS DeHaven DD727 and the USS Henderson DD785. She operated as a training vessel for approximately 124 Naval Reservists. She had an active duty crew of approximately 212. During her reserve assignment she maintained high standards of preparedness to meet any assignment to which she was called.Hollister was decommissioned in September 1979. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 31 August 1979.On 3 March 1983, Hollister was transferred to the Republic of China.Service in the Republic of China NavyShe was commissioned on 15 November 1984 in the Republic of China Navy as ROCS Shao Yang (DD-929).On 1 September 1988, Hui Yang was training in the open sea of Zuoying, and her shells on board the ship jammed. She was advised not enter the Zuoying Naval Base as her jammed shells pose a danger to the dangerous goods but she did moored in the base despite the warning. On the next day, 2 September, there was a non-commissioned officer whom fired her gun by mistake, and the shell directly penetrated the bridge of Shao Yang, killing 2 non-commissioned officers on the spot. The shells finally landed in the storage room of a family member's village. After these two deaths, the weapon commander, gunners and sergeants of the ship were sent to court martial, and an award from Colonel Lei Guangshu was also stripped.On 26 December 1990, she underwent the Wu-Chin III modernization.In June 2002, the case of leaking secrets by Liu Yuelong on the ship broke out and Liu was later sentenced to life imprisonment.She was scheduled for decommissioning on 1 June 2004 at Kaohsiung, Taiwan. After the ship was decommissioned, she was temporarily berthed at the No. 4 Shipyard of the Qijin Navy Base in Kaohsiung Port to undergo disassembly for usable materials.In mid-June 2006, she served as a target ship for the Han Kuang 22 exercise for naval and air force training, and berthed at the Suao Zhongzheng base. After the exercise of Hanguang 22, the ship was towed back to Qijinhai No. 4 Shipyard.She was towed out to sea to be sunk as an artificial reef.ReferencesExternal linkshazegray.org: USS HollisterGearing-class destroyers of the United States Navy Ships built in Seattle 1945 ships Maritime incidents in 2006 World War II destroyers of the United States Cold War destroyers of the United States Korean War destroyers of the United States Vietnam War destroyers of the United States United States Navy South Dakota-related ships Chao Yang-class destroyers Ships sunk as artificial reefs", "machine_text": "USS Hollister (DD-788) was one of the 173 Gearing-class destroyers built for the United States Navy during and after World War II.

He graduated in the arts from Harvard College in 1866, and qualified in medicine at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University in New York City with an M.D. in 1870. He trained further in Europe for 2 years, and started practice in New York in 1873. He became assistant surgeon to the Bellevue Hospital in 1880, and surgeon-in-chief of the Roosevelt Hospital (now Mount Sinai West) in 1888. Here he did his most famous work on appendicitis, presenting his report on operative management to the New York Surgical Society in 1889. He described the point of greatest tenderness in appendicitis, which is now known as McBurney's point. He was professor of surgery from 1889 to 1907, and thereafter became emeritus professor of surgery. He continued to advance the treatment of appendicitis, and in 1894 he described the incision that he used; although the incision had previously been described by Louis L. MacArthur, it became known as McBurney's incision. He was awarded an honorary fellowship by the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1905 during the college's 400th anniversary celebrations. The honorary fellowship was awarded to the 36 most well known surgeons of the time.In addition to his work on appendicitis, McBurney also published papers on the treatment of pyloric stenosis, management of shoulder dislocation with fracture of the humerus, and gallstone disease. He also introduced the use of rubber gloves during his operations to improve aseptic technique, following the lead of William Halsted.After the U.S. President William McKinley was shot on September 6, 1901, Dr. McBurney led the medical team that oversaw his recovery after emergency surgeryand announced to the press on September 10 that the President's condition was improving and that he was out of danger.He was a keen hunter and fisherman, and died in 1913 on a hunting trip in Massachusetts.His grandson was American archaeologist Charles McBurney and his great-grandson is English actor, writer and director Simon McBurney.ReferencesExternal Sources Guide to the Charles McBurney Papers 1894 at the University of Chicago Special Collections Research CenterAmerican surgeons 1845 births 1913 deaths People from Brookline, Massachusetts Harvard College alumni Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons alumni", "machine_text": "Charles McBurney (1845-1913) was an American surgeon who is best known for developing a surgical technique for the treatment of appendicitis. He was born in Roxbury, Massachusetts and received his medical education at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. After completing his medical studies, McBurney served as a surgeon in the United States Army during the Civil War. Following his military service, he practiced medicine in New York City and became a leading authority on diseases of the appendix. In 1889, McBurney published a landmark paper entitled 'The Incision Made in the Abdominal Wall in Cases of Appendicitis, with a Description of a New Method of Operating.' In this paper, he described a surgical technique that involved making a small incision in the right lower quadrant of the abdominal wall, just above the appendix. This approach allowed for better visualization of the appendix and reduced the risk of infection. The McBurney incision, as it became known, quickly gained widespread use and is still commonly used today for the treatment of appendicitis. In addition to his work on appendicitis, McBurney made significant contributions to the field of abdominal surgery, including the development of new techniques for the treatment of hernias and intestinal obstructions. McBurney was also a prominent member of the medical community, serving as president of both the American Surgical Association and the New York Academy of Medicine. He was widely respected for his clinical skill, surgical innovation, and dedication to patient care. Charles McBurney died in 1913 at the age of 68, leaving behind a legacy of medical excellence and pioneering surgical techniques that continue to shape the field of medicine today.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 21455021}

He wrote the novel 'The Ballad of María Abdala.' He is well known for directing the RCN Radio Network (Radio Cadena Nacional de Colombia) from around 1984 to 2010 and during that time had his own radio program that was regularly broadcast in Colombia. Gossaín was a two-time winner in the radio journalism category of the Premio Nacional de Periodismo Simón Bolívar (Translated: Simón Bolívar National Journalism Award), a national award for Colombian journalism.PersonalJuan Gossaín was born in San Bernardo del Viento, Córdoba Department, Caribbean region of Colombia around 1949 to his parents Juan Gossaín and Berta Abdallah. Gossaín's father and mother had immigrated to Colombia from Lebanon. Gossaín studied at Colegio La Esperanza in Cartagena, a boarding school in Cartagena, from age 9 to 17. He married his wife Margoth Ricci on March 24, 1984, and the couple had two children named Danilo and Isabela, and he has at least two grandchildren named Juan and Ana Gabriela. Gossaín currently resides in Cartagena. He was hospitalized in 2012.CareerJuan Gossaín started his journalism career writing for El Espectador newspaper from around 1968 to 1971. He later became Chief at El Heraldo, Barranquilla.Gossaín worked as the director of the RCN Radio station for about 26 years, from February 12, 1984 to June 30, 2010. Gossaín hosted a very popular morning talk show. One of his former colleagues at RCN was Humberto De la Calle, former vice president of Colombia and a negotiator during the peace process, about which Gossaín interviewed him. Gossaín retired in 2010. Over the course of his career as a journalist, he covered at least 10 presidential campaigns and even did a special for El Tiempo newspaper about electoral corruption.Aside from radio journalism, Gossaín was responsible for writing several novels such as 'La balada de Maria Abdala', 'San Bernando del Viento', and 'La mala hierba'. His writing often contained attention grabbing language that enhanced his storytelling leaving his audience in suspense, unable to put his work down. These qualities of writing led Gossaín to be viewed as a fabulist known as someone with the capability of creating exhilarating stories about different characters.Now that Gossaín is retired, he has opened a writing workshop for aspiring journalists. It is called Centro de Altos Estudios Juan Gossaín and he created this place so he could be able to teach young writers the art of narrating reality.Notable literary worksHe wrote the novel 'La balada de María Abdala.' The story is about a dead man who returns to the living in order to witness the burial of his mother.Puro cuento, 2004, was one of Gossaín's most popular and unique works. This novel contained eighteen stories that were results of stories that he knew and experienced after leaving Córdoba, Colombia. These stories were unique and different because the magic of the Caribbean that had previously been seen of his novels was almost completely absent. What Gossaín experienced and portrayed in this novel was the feeling of grayness and the buildings that invaded the souls of the people who lived in them. It had an unfamiliar tone and many of Gossaín's readers were hooked to the work that he had created.In popular cultureLuis Soriano operates a mobile book library, called a Biblioburro, that uses a donkey as his means of transport. He asked for a donation from Gossaín and received Gossaín'ssecond novel, 'The Ballad of Maria Abdala', as well a Gossaín's report about Soriano's effort on RCN Radio, which led to further donations.Impact Gossaín was the recipient of The National Simón Bolívar Award in 1995 and 1997. The nominees and winners of the award are some of the most influential personalities of Colombia. The award is very respected and adored by Colombians making it a big accomplishment to win it.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Arduino Uno\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Arduino Uno is an open-source microcontroller board based on the Microchip ATmega328P microcontroller and developed by Arduino.cc. The board is equipped with sets of digital and analog input/output (I/O) pins that may be interfaced to various expansion boards (shields) and other circuits. The board has 14 digital I/O pins (six capable of PWM output), 6 analog I/O pins, and is programmable with the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment), via a type B USB cable. It can be powered by the USB cable or by an external 9-volt battery, though it accepts voltages between 7 and 20 volts. It is similar to the Arduino Nano and Leonardo. The hardware reference design is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 2.5 license and is available on the Arduino website. Layout and production files for some versions of the hardware are also available.The word 'uno' means 'one' in Italian and was chosen to mark the initial release of Arduino Software. The Uno board is the first in a series of USB-based Arduino boards; it and version 1.0 of the Arduino IDE were the reference versions of Arduino, which have now evolved to newer releases. The ATmega328 on the board comes preprogrammed with a bootloader that allows uploading new code to it without the use of an external hardware programmer.While the Uno communicates using the original STK500 protocol, it differs from all preceding boards in that it does not use the FTDI USB-to-serial driver chip. Instead, it uses the Atmega16U2 (Atmega8U2 up to version R2) programmed as a USB-to-serial converter.HistoryThe Arduino project started at the Interaction Design Institute Ivrea (IDII) in Ivrea, Italy. At that time, the students used a BASIC Stamp microcontroller, at a cost that was a considerable expense for many students. In 2003, Hernando Barragán created the development platform Wiring as a Master's thesis project at IDII, under the supervision of Massimo Banzi and Casey Reas, who are known for work on the Processing language. The project goal was to create simple, low-cost tools for creating digital projects by non-engineers. The Wiring platform consisted of a printed circuit board (PCB) with an ATmega168 microcontroller, an IDE based on Processing, and library functions to easily program the microcontroller. In 2003, Massimo Banzi, with David Mellis, another IDII student, and David Cuartielles, added support for the cheaper ATmega8 microcontroller to Wiring. But instead of continuing the work on Wiring, they forked the project and renamed it Arduino. Early arduino boards used the FTDI USB-to-serial driver chip and anATmega168. The Uno differed from all preceding boards by featuring the ATmega328P microcontroller and an ATmega16U2 (Atmega8U2 up to version R2) programmed as a USB-to-serial converter.Technical specificationsMicrocontroller: Microchip ATmega328POperating Voltage: 5 VoltsInput Voltage: 7 to 20 VoltsDigital I/O Pins: 14 (of which 6 can provide PWM output)PWM Pins: 6 (Pin # 3, 5, 6, 9, 10 and 11)UART: 1I2C: 1SPI: 1Analog Input Pins: 6DC Current per I/O Pin: 20 mADC Current for 3.3V Pin: 50 mAFlash Memory: 32 KB of which 0.5 KB used by bootloaderSRAM: 2 KBEEPROM: 1 KBClock Speed: 16 MHzLength: 68.6 mmWidth: 53.4 mmWeight: 25 gICSP Header: YesPower Sources: DC Power JackUSB PortHeadersGeneral pin functionsLED: There is a built-in LED driven by digital pin 13. When the pin is high value, the LED is on, when the pin is low, it is off.VIN: The input voltage to the Arduino/Genuino board when it is using an external power source (as opposed to 5 volts from the USB connection or other regulated power source). You can supply voltage through this pin, or, if supplying voltage via the power jack, access it through this pin.5V: This pin outputs a regulated 5V from the regulator on the board. The board can be supplied with power either from the DC power jack (7 - 20V), the USB connector (5V), or the VIN pin of the board (7-20V). Supplying voltage via the 5V or 3.3V pins bypasses the regulator, and can damage the board.3V3: A 3.3 volt supply generated by the on-board regulator. Maximum current draw is 50 mA.GND: Ground pins.IOREF: This pin on the Arduino/Genuino board provides the voltage reference with which the microcontroller operates. A properly configured shield can read the IOREF pin voltage and select the appropriate power source, or enable voltage translators on the outputs to work with the 5V or 3.3V.Reset: Typically used to add a reset button to shields that block the one on the board.Special pin functionsEach of the 14 digital pins and 6 analog pins on the Uno can be used as an input or output, under software control (using pinMode(), digitalWrite(), and digitalRead() functions). They operate at 5 volts. Each pin can provide or receive 20 mA as the recommended operating condition and has an internal pull-up resistor (disconnected by default) of 20-50K ohm. A maximum of 40mA must not be exceeded on any I/O pin to avoid permanent damage to the microcontroller. The Uno has 6 analog inputs, labeled A0 through A5; each provides 10 bits of resolution (i.e. 1024 different values). By default, they measure from ground to 5 volts, though it is possible to change the upper end of the range using the AREF pin and the analogReference() function.In addition, some pins have specialized functions:Serial / UART: pins 0 (RX) and 1 (TX). Used to receive (RX) and transmit (TX) TTL serial data. These pins are connected to the corresponding pins of the ATmega8U2 USB-to-TTL serial chip.External interrupts: pins 2 and 3. These pins can be configured to trigger an interrupt on a low value, a rising or falling edge, or a change in value.PWM (pulse-width modulation): pins 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11. Can provide 8-bit PWM output with the analogWrite() function.SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface): pins 10 (SS), 11 (MOSI), 12 (MISO), and 13 (SCK). These pins support SPI communication using the SPI library.TWI (two-wire interface) / I²C: pin SDA (A4) and pin SCL (A5). Support TWI communication using the Wire library.AREF (analog reference): Reference voltage for the analog inputs.CommunicationThe Arduino/Genuino Uno has a number of facilities for communicating with a computer, another Arduino/Genuino board, or other microcontrollers. The ATmega328 provides UART TTL (5V) serial communication, which is available on digital pins 0 (RX) and 1 (TX). An ATmega16U2 on the board channels this serial communication over USB and appears as a virtual com port to software on the computer. The 16U2 firmware uses the standard USB COM drivers, and no external driver is needed. However, on Windows, a .inf file is required. Arduino Software (IDE) includes a serial monitor which allows simple textual data to be sent to and from the board. The RX and TX LEDs on the board will flash when data is being transmitted via the USB-to-serial chip and USB connection to the computer (but not for serial communication on pins 0 and 1). A SoftwareSerial library allows serial communication on any of the Uno's digital pins.Automatic (software) resetRather than requiring a physical press of the reset button before an upload, the Arduino/Genuino Uno board is designed in a way that allows it to be reset by software running on a connected computer. One of the hardware flow control lines (DTR) of the ATmega8U2/16U2 is connected to the reset line of the ATmega328 via a 100 nanofarad capacitor. When this line is asserted (taken low), the reset line drops long enough to reset the chip.This setup has other implications. When the Uno is connected to a computer running Mac OS X or Linux, it resets each time a connection is made to it from software (via USB). For the following half-second or so, the bootloader is running on the Uno. While it is programmed to ignore malformed data (i.e. anything besides an upload of new code), it will intercept the first few bytes of data sent to the board after a connection is opened.See alsoAVR microcontrollersAtmel AVR instruction setIn-system programmingReferencesFurther readingExternal linksUno Rev3 SchematicBoard comparisons:Differences Between Official Arduino Uno Board Revisions (R1/R2/R3)Comparison of Various Arduino BoardsArduino Software Cheat Sheet Pinout DiagramsArduino Uno BoardATmega328 DIPATmega328 SMD MechanicalDimensions and Hole PatternsDimensions, Hole Patterns, Header Locations and PCB TemplatesArduino", "machine_text": "Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board that is designed for enthusiasts, makers, and students to learn and experiment with electronics and programming.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Clientitis\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Clientitis (also called clientism or localitis) is the alleged tendency of resident in-country staff of an organization to regard the officials and people of the host country as 'clients'.Overview This condition can be found in business, military, or government.The term clientitis is somewhat similar to the phrases 'gone native' or 'going native', and may have its origins in the 19th Century when small diplomatic missions were staffed by long-term expatriates with distant connections to their home country.20th and 21st Century rapid communication with home ministries, and frequent rotations of staff, make the term anachronistic and less relevant in modern diplomatic context.A hypothetical example of clientitis would be a Foreign Service Officer (FSO) or foreign diplomat, serving overseas at an Embassy, who drifts into a mode of rationalizing and defending the actions of the host country government.In such an example, the officer has come to view the officials and government workers of the host country government as the persons he is serving.Former USUN Ambassador John Bolton has used this term disparagingly to describe the culture of the U.S. State Department, but the available public record shows little genuine evidence of modern diplomatic clientitis.An example from business would be a representative for a company living in another nation, representing that company to the host nation and other institutions in that country.A business representative suffering clientitis would defend the host country government and operating environment as if those were his employers.A military example would be a defense attaché who identifies reflexively with the host country's military establishment.Within the U.S. State Department The State Department's training for newly appointed ambassadors warns of the danger of clientitis,and the Department rotates FSOs every 2–3 years to avoid it. During the Nixon administration the State Department's Global Outlook Program (GLOP) attempted to combat clientitis by transferring FSOs to regions outside their area of specialization.Robert D. Kaplan alleges that the problem 'became particularly prevalent' among American diplomats in the Middle East because the investment of time needed to learn Arabic and the large number of diplomatic postings where it was spoken meant diplomats could spend their entire career in a single region.Anthony Lake argues that while clientitis is a danger, reflexive accusations of it can deter Foreign Service Officers from providing accurate analysis to policymakers.In modern practice, with tight control from Washington or any other home office, and narrow advancement paths requiring deference to career interests, clientitis (as much as appeasement) is an obsolete label for diplomacy, and use of the stereotype may reflect an anti-elitist or unilateralist agenda.In contrast, caustic and realism-based diplomats' analyses, including recently those of former UK Ambassador Kim Darroch and former U.S. Ambassador Michael McFaul, demonstrate diplomats' main purpose in providing unvarnished opinion, at risk of angering the host government.In the 1990s the phenomenon was seen within the State Department as being particularly acute in El Salvador, reflecting 'both the polarization of the country and the highly ideological position of the United States within that polarization.'Revelations about U.S. diplomatic cables however show how 'U.S. ambassadors really felt about their host governments and gave an unvarnished view of the inner workings of American diplomacy. [And] sparked diplomatic firestorms across the world that left the State Department reeling.'Rather than identifying with host countries, modern diplomats compete with a range of open media and news sources to gain the attention and favor of their home offices, resulting in sharp, opinionated reporting identifying the national interests at stake, potential advantages to be gained, and sometimes writing attention-getting travelogues of local cultural conditions.In 'To The Secretary,' former diplomat Mary Thompson-Jones 'describes several types of cables: official updates, scene setters, biographical profiles, spot reports, daily media reaction and situation reports. “Knowing by instinct when and what to communicate back home is what makes a good diplomat,” she writes. “Their reporting must walk a line between loyally carrying out assignments from Washington, while making essential, sometimes contradictory, points to a foreign policy establishment that does not always want to hear them.”See also OikophobiaReferencesUnited States Department of State Foreign relations of the United States Diplomacy", "machine_text": "Clientitis is a condition that describes an unhealthy obsession with pleasing clients or customers by a business or service provider. It is characterized by a persistent desire to accommodate the clients' every need irrespective of how unreasonable or unrealistic those needs may be. Clients who suffer from clientitis may demand excessive attention, discounts, or special treatment at the expense of the provider's well-being or reputation. The term is derived from the word 'client,' which refers to a person or entity that uses the services or products of a business. In many instances, clientitis is a result of a misguided approach to customer service by the provider. Many businesses believe that customer satisfaction should be their primary goal, and they prioritize it above all else. However, this approach can backfire and lead to negative outcomes such as reduced profitability, unrealistic expectations, and lowered quality standards. The symptoms of clientitis include a fear of losing clients, excessive flexibility, a lack of assertiveness, and a loss of faith in the service or product being provided. These symptoms can often lead to the provider continually lowering prices, giving discounts, or providing expensive perks to placate demanding clients. It can also result in sub-standard products or services, as the provider doesn't have the confidence to stand their ground. To overcome clientitis, providers must adopt a more business-oriented approach to customer service. Customer satisfaction is important but not at the expense of value and profitability. Providers must set clear expectations for their clients and communicate openly and honestly about the limitations of their service. They must also take a proactive approach to address the root causes of negative client feedback. In conclusion, clientitis can be a severe condition that affects businesses and service providers when they prioritize pleasing their clients above all else. Providers must find a balance between managing client expectations and maintaining a sustainable and profitable business. With a more business-oriented approach to customer service, providers can effectively manage client attention while providing quality products and services.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 14124317}

A pace bowler, he took 73 test wickets with best figures of 6 for 75 against West Indies in 2008. He played first class cricket for Wellington, the Leicestershire County Cricket Club and the Middlesex County Cricket Club.He retired from all cricket in January 2012 due to chronic injury problems.International career O'Brien made his debut for the national side in March 2005 following injuries to senior international players, such as Shane Bond, Daryl Tuffey and Chris Martin but has been in and out of the side since to replace injured and retired players. He made his One Day International debut against the England cricket team, and had a tough debut, with figures of 1/59 in 6 overs.However, between 2007 and 2009 he established himself in the Test side, and to a lesser extent, in the ODI side, particularly in the absence of Shane Bond. He was renowned as an 'into-the-wind' bowler who would often bowl at an end that did not offer favourable bowling conditions, especially at the Basin Reserve in Wellington, a ground renowned for strong winds. He enjoyed much success as a fast bowler for the Black Caps, with great performances against England in the UK, and against the West Indies cricket team at home, where he took his best Test figures of 6/75, in a spell of bowling regarded as one of the best in New Zealand. These performance have given him the reputation as a wicket-taking bowler, and being the go-to man for Daniel Vettori, the captain. He continued his consistent spells against the Australia cricket team, home and away, and for Wellington.During New Zealand's tour of England in 2008, he had had similar success, taking 15 wickets at 26.80. Against the Pakistan cricket team at home in December 2009, he has become well known for bowling New Zealand to victory by taking 3 wickets while suffering from a broken thumb. In this same series, he took 6 wickets in the next game, including 4/66, dismissing the likes of Salman Butt, Imran Farhat and Misbah-ul-Haq.In December 2009, he announced his decision to retire from international cricket to spend more time with his wife in England and this decision prompted Middlesex to sign O'Brien as their overseas player for the 2010 season.Domestic career He played at Leicestershire during the 2009 season as their overseas player, impressing by taking 21 first-class wickets at an average of 26.04 in a struggling team, including 9 wickets in a game where he took 6/39 on his birthday.The 2010 season was a frustrating one for O'Brien, he took 23 wickets at an average of 27.30 for Middlesex in division two of the County championship. However, injury restricted his appearances for Middlesex to just seven championship matches, one CB40 match (in which he took 4–41 in 8 overs)a single FP Twenty20 match.WritingPart of O'Brien's appeal to fans is because of his writing, both for his own blog and for cricinfo. Rarely has an international cricketer been so candid about his own faults during his career. O'Brien's blog is not updated straight away after all games, but he generally talks about all games he has played in. It is a far cry from the ghost written columns of most cricketers, and has got him in hot water with NZC before. O'Brien really enjoys writing and has already been a special guest writer in the book Ashes 09: When Freddie Became Jesus and is contributing to a book on New Zealand Indoor Cricket as well.O'Brien also is an occasional contributor to Test Match Sofa – an online alternative cricket commentary service as well as BBC and Sky cricket commentary teams.See also List of Middlesex County Cricket Club List A cricketers#OReferencesExternal links1976 births Living people New Zealand cricketers New Zealand Test cricketers New Zealand One Day International cricketers New Zealand Twenty20 International cricketers Wellington cricketers Leicestershire cricketers Cricketers from Lower Hutt Middlesex cricketers", "machine_text": "Iain Edward Edward Michael O'Brien is a former New Zealand international cricketer who played for the national team from 2005 to 2009.

Under the pen-names Martin Grainger and Maurice Brinton, he wrote and translated for the British group Solidarity from 1960 until the early 1980s. As a neurologist, he produced the accepted criteria for brainstem death, and wrote the entry on death for Encyclopædia Britannica.Life Chris Pallis was born to a prominent Anglo-Greek family, 'of whose intellectual achievements he was always extremely proud'. The poet Alexandros Pallis was a great-uncle, and so the writers Marietta Pallis and Marco Pallis were also relatives. His father Alex was general manager of the family firm of merchant bankers, Ralli Brothers; when he retired, he returned from India to settle in Switzerland. Educated there, Chris Pallis became fluent in French, English and Greek.In 1940 the family managed to take the last boat out of France, and settled in England. Pallis went up to study medicine at Balliol College, Oxford in 1941. Joining the Communist Party of Great Britain, he was quickly expelled for criticising its policy on the Second World War, and became a member of the Trotskyist Revolutionary Communist Party.In 1947 he married Jeanne Marty, a working-class French university student, and for a decade he dropped out of politics to pursue his medical career. In 1957 he joined the Trotskyist group led by Gerry Healy, the Club, which in 1959 became the Socialist Labour League. He was expelled by Healy in 1960 and with a group of other ex-members of the SLL immediately set up Solidarity. Like a number of other former members of the SLL he was also involved with the journal International Socialism in the early 1960s.For the next 20 years, he combined a distinguished medical career under his real name with pseudonymous revolutionary socialist writing and translation. When he was outed for his use of the name Martin Grainger in such left wing journals as the New Statesman, he changed his pseudonym. Subsequently his boss, Christopher Booth, defended him from further press criticism, saying he was a fine neurologist entitled to his own political views.His work includes several eyewitness accounts of key moments in European left politics (the Belgian general strike of 1960, Paris in May 1968, Portugal's Carnation Revolution in 1974–75), a substantial body of English translations of the work of Cornelius Castoriadis, the main thinker of the French group Socialisme ou Barbarie, and two short books – one (The Bolsheviks and Workers' Control, 1970) on the aftermath of the Bolshevik revolution, and one (The Irrational in Politics, 1974) on sexual politics.The publishers of a recent online edition of The Bolsheviks and Workers' Control describe it as follows:Chris Pallis died in March 2005.ReferencesFurther reading Brinton, Maurice (Goodway, David ed).

He was known for his research on language acquisition in children and adults, and for his critique of behaviorism and Chomskyan linguistics. Pallis was born in London in 1935 and was educated at Dulwich College and Cambridge University. He began his career as a teacher in 1959 and then taught philosophy and psychology at Keele University in Staffordshire, England. Later, he moved to the University of Sussex where he was a professor of linguistics and cognitive science until his retirement in 2000. One of Pallis' most notable contributions to linguistics was his critique of behaviorism, which dominated the field in the mid-20th century. He argued that language acquisition could not be explained solely by environmental factors and that innate factors, such as the human brain's capacity for language, played a significant role. This perspective paved the way for the emergence of cognitive science and the study of the biological bases of language. Pallis was also critical of Noam Chomsky's theories of language, which posited that humans possess an innate language acquisition device. He instead proposed a more dynamic and flexible model of language acquisition that took into account the individual's environment and their cognitive and social development. In addition to his work on language acquisition, Pallis conducted research on topics such as imagination, consciousness, and creativity. He authored several books and numerous articles throughout his career, including “The Origins of Language” and “Imagination and Literacy.” Pallis passed away in 2016, leaving behind a legacy of groundbreaking research and critical examination of established theories.

The team also consisted of Tom Howell at third and Alex Fenson at lead, except for the 2014–15 season when Andrew Stopera played lead. At the 2013 World Junior Curling Championships in Sochi, Russia, they finished in seventh place with a record of 4–5. At their second trip to the World Juniors in 2016, they found more success, finishing the round-robin in first place with a record of 8–1.

The concept of Judge, Jury, and Executioner dates back to ancient times when people had to take justice into their own hands. The phrase generally suggests that the same person holds the power to arrest, judge, and execute a verdict. The practice is illegal in many countries and punishable by law. During the medieval era, the authority to judge witnesses, offenders, and the victim lay solely on the monarch. Henry VIII was a famous example of a monarch who supported the rights of Judge, Jury, and Executioner. Later on, the concept started to become more nuanced, and as a result, rights of the various parties involved in the justice system started to become better protected. However, there have been several instances throughout history where people have been granted the power to act as Judge, Jury, and Executioner. Vigilante groups have taken justice into their own hands and inflicted punishment with no legal authority. The result was that innocent people would end up being punished without proper or fair trial. Currently, the concept of Judge, Jury, and Executioner is not acceptable. Everyone, regardless of the crime they are accused of committing, has the right to a fair trail and legal representation. The role of the judge is to pass judgement while the Jury decides whether the accused is guilty or not guilty. It is the responsibility of the legal system to enact the punishment or carry out the sentences appropriately. In conclusion, the concept of Judge, Jury, and Executioner has evolved throughout history, and while it may have been acceptable once, it is not acceptable now. Legal systems exist to protect citizens, and it is the responsibility of the legal system to ensure justice is carried out in a fair and appropriate way. Any deviation from this is considered illegal, and it is punishable by law.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 38657502}

The next three World Championships (1955, 1958, and 1960) only had men participating. Women first participated in the 1963 World Championships in Mexico City. From 1963 to 2003, the World Championships were conducted every fourth year.Current Championships As a result of the expanding number of federations competing, it was agreed in 2001 to divide the two genders in World Championships beginning in 2005.This affected the schedules for the following two 4 years cycles as follows:World Women Championships was conducted in 2005, 2007, 2009 and 2011.World Men Championships was conducted in 2006, 2008 and 2010 (2012 was moved to 2013).World Championships for both genders were reintroduced in 2009 after a World Congress resolved to hold them every fourth year. In 2013, the inaugural edition of these so-called Combined World Championships took place. The number of teams allowed to compete in the Combined World Championships is limited to 36 teams per gender, one of which is the host federation's team, and the other 35 federations are chosen from the Zones based on the number of federations in each zone as of the qualifying date.The following are the most recent four-year World Championship cycles:2018: World Men Championships2019: World Women Championships2021: Combined World ChampionshipsThe above-mentioned four-year cycles will be repeated for the 2022-2025 cycles, and so on.Format of the games and disciplines through the yearsfrom 1954 The format for the championships has changed many times throughout its history. In the early years of the championships, men competed in four different categories: Doubles, 4-man team, 8-man team and masters. Up until 1963 women did not participate in the event. The first year that women did take part, they competed in 4 different categories, doubles, four-person team (European Style), four-person team (American Style) and masters.This is the only time the 'European Style' has been used in the championships.In the following championships the European style four-person team was replaced with the five-person team event (American Style) and was used until 1979.Current format and disciplines Singles, Doubles, Trios, Team of Five, All Events, and Masters have been the disciplines for both genders since 1979, with 6 women and 6 men on each team. The medalists for these events except the Masters from 1979 to 2007 were determined by total pinfall.After the conclusion of singles, doubles, trios, and five-person team events, the All Events medals are presented to the top three bowlers of both genders who have accumulated the most pinfall over the 24 games.Addition of Match-Play in the finalsBeginning in 2008, a medal round was introduced for singles, doubles, trios, and 5 five person team event. The Medal round consisted of the top four qualifiers playing a knockout format to determine the medalists (1 vs 4 and 2 vs 3, winners of those matches face each other in the final).The masters event has only recently changed with the onset of the championships splitting into 2 different events.Up until 2005 the top 16 would bowl a 16-game Round Robin with the top 3 bowlers after the 16 games advancing through to a stepladder final.From 2005 to 2011, the masters was played using the matchplay style, best of 5 format.From 2013-2015, the top 24 men and women in All-Events advanced to the Masters event. All players will bowl six games with the All-Events total carried forward. The top 8 after 30 games advance to seven games of round robin match play, where 20 bonus points are awarded for a won match and 10 bonus points for a tied match. The top 4 advance to the semifinals, which is a one-game match, 1 vs 4 and 2 vs 3. The semifinal losers will earn a bronze medal. The semifinal winners advance to a one-game final match to determine gold and silver medals. In 2017, the masters format (still consisting of top 24 men and women) reverted to matchplay style, best of 3.Modification in Team Event Beginning in 2017, the five-person team event was modified. Qualifying was still all five players bowl ten frames each with their scores added together to determine the overall score. In the medal round, the five players bowl a best of 3 baker format, where players bowl in order one frame each (frames 1-5) and repeat the order from frames 6-10.Dual pattern lane condition format In 2005 the World Championships adopted the 'dual pattern format' lane conditions. The two patterns are chosen from a bank of oil patterns certified by World Bowling. These oil patterns are classified as 'short', 'medium', and 'long'.Each bowler at the championships will bowl an equal number of games on the two patterns.In the masters, each match is played on alternating lane patterns with the highest seed having the choice of which pattern to start on.The concept of having two different lane patterns is to force the bowlers to be more versatile in the championships. The two different lane patterns force the bowlers to attack each pattern from different angles, using different styles of play, such as ball speed, hand position and ball choice. It has been argued that in previous championships around the world, using one pattern for the whole event would suit certain bowlers over others, which was deemed as being unfair.It was agreed that having two different lane conditions would be a fairer way of determining the best bowlers at the championships.Many other championships around the world have also adopted this format, such as the Men's and Women's European Championships, the Asian Games, the World Ranking Masters, The Commonwealth Championships and the Asian Championships. World Bowling announced in December 2015 only one lane pattern will be used for the entirety of future World Championships, ending the dual pattern format.Championships World Bowling Executive Board have awarded the 2021 Combined World Championships hosting rights to Kuwait. Hong Kong will host the Men's World Championships in 2018, and Las Vegas will host the Women's World Championships in 2019.A new event, WTBA World Singles Championships for men and women, was held for the first time in Limassol, Cyprus from September 18–26, 2012, and will be held subsequently every four years.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Rondout Creek\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Rondout Creek is atributary of the Hudson River in Ulster and Sullivan counties, New York, United States. It rises on Rocky Mountain in the eastern Catskills, flows south into Rondout Reservoir, part of New York City's water supply network, then into the valley between the Catskills and the Shawangunk Ridge, where it goes over High Falls and finally out to the Hudson at Kingston, receiving along the way the Wallkill River.The name of Rondout Creek comes from the fort, or redoubt, that was erected near its mouth. The Dutch equivalent of the English word redoubt (meaning a fort or stronghold) is reduyt. In the Dutch records of Wildwyck, however, the spelling used to designate this same fort is invariably Ronduyt during the earliest period, with the present form rondout (often capitalized) appearing as early as November 22, 1666.The Rondout Creek became economically important in the 19th century when the Delaware and Hudson Canal followed closely alongside it from Napanoch to the village of Rondout, now part of Kingston, which grew rapidly as the canal's northern port. Today it is important not only for the reservoir, but for the fishing and other recreational opportunities it provides.Due to the Wallkill, it drains a vast area stretching overall the way down to Sussex County, New Jersey. The high mountains around its upper course and the reservoir, which collects water from three others, also add to its flow.Course The Rondout goes through several different stages because of the changes in surrounding geography and past development, such as the canal and reservoir, that has drawn on its waters. Its headwaters, above the reservoir, are a typical mountain stream. Below the reservoir it remains fairly rocky but widens into the floor of a narrow valley. At Napanoch, where it turns northeast and receives its first significant tributary, the Ver Nooy Kill, it becomes wider, as does the valley it drains, and deeper.North of the Shawangunks, where the Wallkill trickles down from Sturgeon Pool, it is wide enough to be referred to as the Rondout River at some points. At Creeklocks, the former northern outlet of the canal, it becomes wide and deep enough to be navigable, and several marinas line the banks of the stream, now more thanwide, at Kingston just above its mouth.Catskills and headwatersRising below the col between Rocky Mountain and Balsam Cap, the Rondout Creek flows generally southerly down the slopes of Rocky Mountain into a narrow valley, receiving tributary Picket Brook on the left and three unnamed streams from the slopes of Peekamoose Mountain to the right. A mile or two from its source, it reaches some private lands and its first road, Peekamoose Road (Ulster County 42). It has droppedin its first two miles. It turns to the southwest to follow a wider valley, known informally as Peekamoose Gorge. Most of the land surrounding the creek is part of New York's Forest Preserve, 'forever wild' and thus undeveloped. The rocky stream boasts several popular swimming holes, one of which is known as Blue Hole for the greenish tone of the deep water within. South of the small outlet stream from Peekamoose Lake, it is crossed and then followed by Peekamoose Road, which at first runs high above the creek but then close by it.Along here it receives several tributaries from the right — Buttermilk Falls Brook, with its eponymous waterfall near its mouth, High Falls Brook and Bear Hole Brook — most of them rising, like the Rondout itself, in the Slide Mountain Wilderness Area to the west. To the east is another Forest Preserve management unit, the Sundown Wild Forest. Some unnamed tributaries come from here. Because of the protected areas on both sides of the creek and the ease of public access, this area has become one of the Catskills' popular trout streams, and fly-fishermen can be seen here during the season.It crosses under Peekamoose Road, here also carrying the Long Path hiking trail, again just north of a popular camping area in the small Peekamoose Wild Forest, and then passes the hamlet of Sundown and widens slightly as a floodplain develops alongside. The land along the creek is now largely in private hands, and there is little public access to it as it crosses into Sullivan County.Reservoir to Napanoch After crossing under NY 55A, it widens into the reservoir just below Grahamsville and begins flowing more to the east-southeast. Routes 55 and 55A bracket the reservoir to the south and north respectively. One-third of the way along the reservoir'slength, it crosses back into Ulster County. Now at an elevation of , the creek resumes at the site of the former hamlet of Lackawack, leaving the Catskill Park, now headed eastwards, in a rocky, wider streambed through some slightly more development.It follows closely alongside Route 55, deviating from it only when it turns north to Honk Lake, another impoundment. Past here it crosses under 55 again and comes into Napanoch. After crossing under US 209 and receiving the Ver Nooy Kill it bends northeast, paralleling the Shawangunk Ridge and the edge of the Catskill Plateau.Rondout Valley The creek, here wider and deeper, forms the bed of a widening valley as it continues northeast past Eastern Correctional Facility, where the first remnant of the canal, an empty ditch next to an old railroad station, can be found alongside. The creek continues towards Kerhonkson, where Route 55 and US 44 cross over. US 209 continues paralleling the Rondout towards High Falls, as it begins to curve to the east around the northern end of the ridge.Here, it goes over the spectacular waterfall that gives the community its name, just below NY 213. These were the subject of controversy in recent years, since they were considered both a popular swimming hole and an attractive nuisance. The local fire department, which owned the land, had to sell it to keep its liability insurance premiums affordable, and the new owner has posted the property for the same reason.Lower Rondout and KingstonAround the north end of the Shawangunks, it receives as tributaries many of the streams of the Minnewaska State Preserve: Peters Kill, Stony Kill and Coxing Kill. It begins to curve more to the east again. Route 213 replaces Route 209 as the Rondout's paralleling road, with the canal's empty ditch running next to both along the way to Rosendale, the next settlement, which grew up around the canal and, later, a local cement industry that used the creek to get its product to market.Here it crosses under Route 213 and NY 32 in a gravel-lined flood control channel, but returns to a more natural bed shortly afterwards to flow beneath the New York State Thruway. In the wooded areas east of the Thruway, the Wallkill River, its flow attenuated by Sturgeon Pool just upriver, joins in from the south. The Rondout turns north, then east again, crossing Route 213 again. At Creeklocks the last lock and the end of the canal are still visible.In Kingston itself it widens and flows under a pair of bridges, the historic Kingston–Port Ewen Suspension Bridge, which carried US 9W until the construction of the neighboring John T. Loughran Bridge. The city's West Strand neighborhood along the waterfront has been rejuvenated in recent years and many boats can be seen moored at docks here on summer weekends. Old shipbuilders' factories line the northern bank, and one of them has been converted into the Hudson River Maritime Museum. After a slight curve through swampier, less developed lowlands in the Kingston Point neighborhood, the Rondout empties into the Hudson at Rondout Lighthouse, just opposite Rhinecliff.HistoryColonial era The early Dutch settlers realized the value of the creek for their colonial ambitions. However, the contention that a trading post or fort was established at the mouth of the Rondout in the early part of the 17th century is thoroughly debunked in Marc B. Fried's The Early History of Kingston and Ulster County, NY, pp. 3–14 and 155–61. The first non-Native structure at this location was undoubtedly the house of settler Christoffel Davits in 1653, and a fort was built here by the colonial government in 1660. The local Native Americans likewise frequented the area. In 1652, an Englishman, Thomas Chambers, became the first to acquire a land deed from the Indians, nearby, along the Esopus Creek (which has a vast expanse of good farmland), and thus began the genesis of present-day Kingston. The Rondout's role in the area's early settlement was as a port for the settlement that was made along the Esopus Creek [The Early History of Kingston, chapter 2]Canal eraSettlement did slowly progress inland, but it was not until well after American independence that the Rondout would become economically important. In the early 1820s two Philadelphia businessmen realized the immense profits that could be made if they could find a way to get the mostly unmined high-quality anthracite coal from undeveloped Northeastern Pennsylvania to the lucrative markets of New York City. Railroads had not yet been perfected, so they saw the possibility of a canal running from Honesdale, Pennsylvania, to the Hudson at what was then the village of Rondout. In 1828 they obtained a charter for their company to do this, and the Delaware and Hudson Canal was opened a few years later. Coal was transferred from canal barges to river ships at Rondout, and it became a boomtown quickly. The canal remained a prosperous operation until late in the 19th century when rail transportation finally became more affordable, and ended its days in 1904 after a brief period carrying Rosendale cement. The former terminal port area for the canal is now Kingston's Rondout-West Strand Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places.Reservoir era In the mid-20th century, the stream would find another important use. Naturalist John Burroughs had anticipated it when he explored the upper headwaters with a friend early in the century, writing in his essay 'A Bed of Boughs' of the purity of the stream's waters and its benefits for both man and fish:Starting in 1915 with Ashokan Reservoir, New York City had been expanding its water supply system with reservoirs in the Catskills. In 1937 it began construction of Merriman Dam near Lackawack, which would soon be flooded forever to allow the growing city to tap the pure waters Burroughs had written about. Those waters began to reach city taps in 1951, and the reservoir itself was completed three years later. Today, via the Delaware Aqueduct, and the connections it has via the Neversink Aqueduct to the Neversink, Pepacton and Cannonsville reservoirs to the west supplementing the upper Rondout's drainage, it supplies half the city's daily water draw.See alsoList of rivers of New York List of crossings of Rondout Creek MV Rip Van WinkleReferencesExternal linksRivers of New York (state) Tributaries of the Hudson River Rivers of Ulster County, New York Rivers of Sullivan County, New York", "machine_text": "Rondout Creek is a 63-mile-long tributary of the Hudson River in eastern New York State, United States. The creek flows through the Ulster and Sullivan counties, and is named after the Dutch word 'Rond Hout,' meaning 'round wood,' a reference to the rounded logs that were floated down the creek from the Catskill Mountains to be used for shipbuilding. The creek has played an important role in the economic development of Ulster County, serving as a major transportation route for shipping goods and passengers. The towns along its banks, including Kingston, Rosendale, and High Falls, were major industrial centers in the 19th century, with mills, tanneries, and paper factories utilizing the power of the creek to operate their machinery. Today, Rondout Creek is a popular destination for recreational activities such as swimming, fishing, and kayaking. The creek is home to a variety of fish species, including trout and bass, and is stocked annually by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. The Rondout Creek Trail is a popular hiking and biking path that follows the path of the creek through the towns of Kingston, Rosendale, and Hurley. The trail offers stunning views of the creek, as well as access to historic landmarks such as the Rosendale Trestle, a former railroad bridge that spans the creek and offers breathtaking views of the surrounding landscape. Environmental conservation and protection efforts along the creek have been a major focus of recent years, with organizations such as the Rondout Creek Watershed Alliance working to preserve the creek's water quality and natural habitats. Despite some previous pollution concerns, the creek is generally considered safe for swimming and water sports. In conclusion, Rondout Creek is a vital waterway that has played an important role in the history and development of Ulster County. Today, it remains a popular destination for tourists and locals alike, offering a range of recreational activities and opportunities to connect with nature.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2256448}

These tents can be compressed into small, lightweight packages and quickly erected when needed, making them popular for camping and outdoor activities. Another type of deployable structure is the folding bridge, which can be transported on a small trailer and then unfolded to span a river or other obstacle. In the field of emergency response, deployable structures are often used as temporary shelters for displaced individuals. These structures can be quickly assembled and disassembled, allowing them to be moved to different locations as needed. During natural disasters such as hurricanes or earthquakes, deployable structures can be essential in providing shelter and protection for survivors. In the military, deployable structures are used for mobile command centers, field hospitals, and barracks. These structures can be quickly set up and taken down, allowing military personnel to adapt to changing conditions on the battlefield. In space exploration, deployable structures are used to create habitats, solar arrays, and other necessary equipment. These structures must be able to withstand the harsh conditions of space and be easily transported on spacecraft. In architecture, deployable structures allow for creative and dynamic designs. These structures can be used to create temporary buildings or to add flexibility to permanent structures. They can also be used to create innovative public art installations.

Since its founding, the IGE has held several seminars and lectures featuring a variety of individuals, including author Eric Metaxas, physician Dr. Peter Dysart, former presidential speech writer Michael Gerson, political commentator Matthew Dowd, UN Ambassador Samuel Brownback, and former Secretary of Defense Gen. Jim Mattis. The organization also produces “The Daily Briefing,” an email that goes out three times a week covering the news of the day with a Christian perspective.Rankings and recognitionU.S. NewsWorld Report ranks Dallas Baptist University, DBU, as 214th among 'National Universities' in its 2017 edition.Traditions In its early years, Dallas Baptist University's mascot was the Indians, but in the late 1980s, it was changed to the Patriot, and the school colors were changed from blue and gold to the more patriotic theme colors of red, white, and blue.Cross RingThe Official DBU Cross Ring serves as a symbol of the Christ-centered education students experience at DBU. The ring features many university symbols, including the Mahler Student Center, the Fishers of Men statue, as well as the university seal.Mr. Patriot One of DBU's longest running tradition, stemming from when DBU's mascot was the Indians, is the Mr. Patriot pageant. This anticipated event, formerly named Mr. Big Chief from 1981 to 2018, allows male students to show off their skills, humor, and creativity. The show, a mock beauty pageant, begins with an opening number performed by all the contestants and is followed by three categories: the stamp act (formalwear), the tea act (beachwear), and the intolerable act (talent). The categories were formerly known as just talent, beachwear, and formalwear. Magic tricks, lip-syncing, and musical interpretations are just some of the ways contestants have attempted to gain points in the past. The contestant with the most points at the end wins the coveted title, and has rights to wear the coat and hat that have replaced the headdress on display in the Dean Learning Center as the prize.Family events Family Weekend and Grandparents Day allow students to invite their families into their lives on campus. Notable events include the Family Softball Game, Movie on the Quad, and Art Show as well as a family service project. Families are invited to fellowship with their students as well as the university faculty and staff through community activities and other fun events.Unity WalkBeginning in 2017, DBU has held an annual Unity Walk on MLK Day, with the DBU community coming together to remember the world of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and pray for the dream of a unified country to become a reality. In addition to the walk, a special speaker each year recites Dr. King's famous “I Have a Dream” speech.

Miller (1830–1914).Transfer to Puget SoundIn 1889, Multnomah was transferred to Puget Sound, where under the ownership of the S. Willey Navigation Company she made regular runs from Olympia to points on Puget Sound.In 1900, Captain H.H. McDonald (1857–1924), who had already been operating the sternwheelers Elwood and Skagit Queen on the lower Sound, bought Multnomah and Capital City (ex-Dalton) from S. Willey Navigation, and put them in competition with the Greyhound, which had been taken off the Seattle-Tacoma run.There was a rate war between the two concerns, and eventually Greyhound’s owners, acting as the Olympia-Tacoma Navigation Company, bought Multnomah and Capital City from Captain McDonald.Captain George W. Barlow, a son of an Oregon pioneer family, commanded all three vessels at various times; he retired in 1910.In 1900, Multnomah and City of Aberdeen hauled beer from the Olympia Brewery to various points on Puget Sound.Once acquired by the Olympia-Tacoma Navigation Company, Greyhound ran with Multnomah on the Seattle-Tacoma-Olympia route, making at various smaller landings in the South Sound, including Three Tree Point and Johnson’s Landing on Anderson Island.Other captains for the Olympia-Tacoma Navigation Company included George L.

It was powered by a triple-expansion steam engine, and its sternwheel measured 23 feet in diameter. The vessel was named after Multnomah County, Oregon, which is home to the city of Portland. During its operational years, the steamship was a significant part of the transportation system along the Columbia River. Aside from passenger transport, it carried cargo, including lumber, grain, and other goods. It made regular trips between Portland and The Dalles, a distance of about 100 miles, with stops at various ports along the way. In 1915, the ORN merged with the Union Pacific Railroad, and the Multnomah was sold to the Northwestern Steamship Company. It continued to operate as a passenger steamer on the Columbia River until 1932, when it was retired from service. Following its retirement, the Multnomah was sold to a salvage company and eventually dismantled for scrap. Today, a replica of the steamship can be found at the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry in Portland, Oregon.

Willow River was chosen as a changing station for the coach horses.In 1861 the Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad was organized with the financial help of Jay Cooke. It was only in August 1879 that the completed line from St. Paul to Duluth was opened. The railroad helped settle and promote living in the northern part of Minnesota. The railroad also promoted the lumber industry. Many towns and villages, including Willow River, were organized once a lumber company set up shop.In March 1874, the Kettle River Township was organized and Willow River at this time consisted of a railroad depot, water tank, wood yard, and two section houses built for the railroad hands.Pine County records show that the three sections of land that would eventually make up the village of Willow River were homesteaded by Edward Clough, Albert Kinney, Peter Jarvis, Joseph Nebula, and Richard Abbott. In 1886, Abbott sold his section of land to the Fox-Wisdom Lumber Company. In 1888, Jarvis sold his section to Fox-Wisdom. In the spring of 1890, Warren D. Fox and John Wisdom opened the Fox-Wisdom Lumber Company in Willow River. The company then platted the land to build their business and offer lots for employees. By 1895, Kinney had leased his land to Fox-Wisdom, and Clough had sold all but 80 acres of his section in the northern part of the village. Joseph Nebula's section was past the lake and likely unusable to the company.The Fox-Wisdom Lumber Company sawmill was constructed and opened in March 1890. It was located on the south side of the present day Willow River dam. To ease the flow of logs, dams were built along the river to store water. There were as least three built and maintained by Fox-Wisdom. They were known as the 'Mile and a Half,' the 'Willow Lake,' and the 'Oak Lake' dams. Sawmill operations began in the early spring and continued until the freeze-up of the mill pond. The mill produced lumber, lath, and shingles employing about 125 men. The mill cut 125,000 feet of lumber per day during their peak season. Many who worked in the logging camps during the winter came to the mill to work in the spring.On May 8, 1891, the village plat was filed in Pine County. The Fox-Wisdom Lumber Company and its employees made up the majority of property owners. Willow River, like many other villages in northern Minnesota, owed its existence to the lumber industry. In November 1891, Willow River was incorporated as a village by a vote of 37 to 18 in the upstairs hall of the Fox-Wisdom Company store.Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of whichis land andis water.Demographics2010 census As of the census of 2010, there were 415 people, 173 households, and 103 families residing in the city.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Cuban intervention in Angola\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Cuban intervention in Angola (codenamed Operation Carlota) began on 5 November 1975, when Cuba sent combat troops in support of the communist-aligned People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) against the pro-western National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) and National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA). The intervention came after the outbreak of the Angolan Civil War, which occurred after the former Portuguese colony was granted independence after the Angolan War of Independence. The civil war quickly became a proxy war between the Eastern Bloc led by the Soviet Union and the Western Bloc led by the United States. South Africa and the United States backed UNITA and the FNLA, while communist nations backed the MPLA.Some 4,000 Cuban troops helped to turn back a three-pronged advance by the SADF, UNITA, FLNA, and Zairean troops. Later, 18,000 Cuban troops defeated the FNLA in the north and UNITA in the south. Separatists from the Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (FLEC) fought the Cubans but were defeated. In 1976, the Cuban military in Angola reached 36,000 troops. Following the withdrawal of Zaire and South Africa (March 1976), Cuban forces remained in Angola to support the MPLA government against UNITA in the continuing civil war. South Africa spent the following decade launching bombing and strafing raids from its bases in South West Africa into southern Angola, while UNITA engaged in ambushes, hit-and-run attacks, and harassment of Cuban units.In 1988, Cuban troops (increased to about 55,000) intervened again to avert military disaster in a Soviet-led People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola (FAPLA) offensive against UNITA, which was still supported by South Africa, leading to the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale and the opening of a second front. This turn of events is considered to have been the major impetus to the success of the ongoing peace talks leading to the New York Accords, the agreement by which Cuban and South African forces withdrew from Angola while South West Africa gained its independence from South Africa. Cuban military engagement in Angola ended in 1991, while the Angolan Civil War continued until 2002. Cuban casualties in Angola totaled approximately 10,000 dead, wounded or missing.BackgroundFailure of the Alvor Agreement and Civil WarThe Carnation Revolution of 25 April 1974 in Portugal took the world by surprise and caught the independence movements in its last African colonies unprepared. After smooth negotiations, Mozambique's independence was granted on 25 June 1975, but Angolan control remained disputed between the three rival independence movements: MPLA, FNLA and UNITA in Angola-proper and Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (FLEC) in Cabinda.Until independence, the independence movements' priority lay in fighting the colonial power and they initially had no clear alliances. With the disappearance of Portugal as their common foe, ethnic and ideological rivalries moved to the fore. Fighting between the three already broke out in November 1974, starting in Luanda and quickly spreading across all of Angola. The new leftist Portuguese government showed little interest in interfering but often favored the MPLA. The country soon fell apart into different spheres of influence, the FNLA taking hold of northern Angola and UNITA in the central south. The MPLA mostly held the coastline, the far south-east and, in November 1974 gained control of Cabinda. The disunity of the three main movements postponed the handing over of power. The Alvor Agreement, which the three and Portugal signed on 15 January, proved to be no solid foundation for the procedure. The transitional government the agreement provided for was equally composed of the three big independence movements and Portugal. It was sworn in on 31 January 1975; independence day was set for 11 November 1975, the same day of the ceasefire. FLEC was not part of the deal because it fought for the independence of Cabinda, which the Portuguese had administratively joined as an exclave to Angola.Fighting in Luanda (referred to as the 'Second War of Liberation' by the MPLA) resumed hardly a day after the transitional government took office, when Agostinho Neto took advantage of the ceasefire to launch a purge of his rival Daniel Chipenda's supporters within the MPLA. The Chipenda faction was largely annihilated, leaving the FLNA as the only remaining obstacle to MPLA control of the city. Chipenda and 2,000 of his surviving troops defected to FLNA around February, which further heightened tensions. FNLA troops, flown in from Zaire, had been taking positions in Luanda since October 1974. The MPLA had followed later in smaller numbers. To that point, the MPLA and UNITA 'had given every sign of intending to honour the Alvor agreement', however fighting broke out in Luanda between the FNLA and the MPLA. The FNLA were backed by Mobutu, the U.S., and China. By March, the FNLA from northern Angola was driving on Luanda joined by units of the Zairian army which the U.S. had encouraged Mobutu to provide. On 28 April, the FNLA unleashed a second wave of attacks and in early May, 200 Zairian troops crossed into northern Angola in its support. Neto requested the Soviets increase its military aid to the MPLA. During March 1975, Soviet pilots flew thirty planeloads of weapons into Brazzaville, where they were then transported to Luanda. The Soviet Union airlifted thirty million dollars' worth of weaponry to the MPLA in three months, while Cuba deployed a contingent of 230 military advisers and technicians to the MPLA, with the first advisers arriving in May.The fighting intensified with street clashes in April and May, and UNITA became involved after over two hundred of its members were massacred by an MPLA contingent in June. The initially weaker MPLA retreated south but with supplies finally arriving from the Soviet Union then succeeded in driving the FNLA out of Luanda by 9 July, and UNITA voluntarily withdrew to its stronghold in the south. The FNLA took up positions east of Kifangondo at the eastern outskirts of the capital, from where it kept up its pressure, and eliminated all remaining MPLA presence in the northern provinces of Uige and Zaire. The fighting was taken up throughout the whole country. The independence movements attempted to seize key strategic points, most importantly the capital on the day of independence. By August, the MPLA had control of 11 of the 15 provincial capitals, including Cabinda and Luanda. The fighting was taken up throughout the whole country. The independence movements attempted to seize key strategic points, most importantly the capital on the day of independence.Foreign involvement Starting in the early 1960s, the three big independence movements enjoyed support from a wide range of countries, in some cases even from the same. By the time of independence, FNLA and UNITA received aid from the U.S., Zaire, South Africa and China.As long as Portugal was present in Angola, the movements had to have their headquarters in independent neighbouring countries, making Congo-Léopoldville (Zaire/Democratic Republic of the Congo, formerly Belgian), for both MPLA and FNLA a logical choice. After its expulsion from Léopoldville (now Kinshasa) in November 1963, the MPLA moved across the Congo River to formerly French Congo-Brazzaville (Republic of Congo), where it was invited by its new leftist government. The FNLA stayed in Congo-Léopoldville to which it remained closely tied and from where it received the bulk of its support. FNLA leader Holden Roberto was linked to Mobutu by marriage and obligated to him for many past favours. Over the years the FNLA had become little more than an extension of Mobutu's own armed forces. Much of Zaire's support came indirectly from the U.S., with which Zaire's leader Mobutu had close ties. Zaire was the first country to send troops to Angola in March 1975 and to engage in fighting against the MPLA by the summer of that year.In the summer of 1974, China was first to act after the Portuguese Revolution and posted 200 military instructors to Zaire where they trained FNLA troops and supplied military assistance. Chinese involvement was a measure against Soviet influence rather than that from western countries. On 27 October 1975, they were also the first to withdraw their military instructors. UNITA, which split away from FNLA in 1965/66 was initially Maoist and received some support from China. China had been training Mobutu's elite division, the Kamanyola, also trained the FNLA but withdrew their support for Zaire and the FNLA by the end of December 1975. In 1975 China were also the first to pull out of the area after the Portuguese Revolution. When their support ceased FNLA and UNITA became firmly established in the western camp.The United States had a history of supporting the Salazar regime in Portugal. They allowed NATO equipment to be used in Angola during the Independence War. U.S. support for the FNLA was taken up by the Kennedy administration in 1960. Holden Roberto had been on the Central Intelligence Agency's (CIA) payroll since 1963. On 7 July 1974, the CIA started funding the FNLA on a small scale. On 22 January 1975, one week after the Alvor Accords were signed and just before the provisional government of Angola was to take office, the U.S. National Security Council's '40 Committee', which oversaw clandestine CIA operations, authorized US 300,000 in covert aid to the FNLA.As the CIA was suspicious of the left-leaning MPLA, it 'had no wish to see the US government deal with the MPLA' and it did not want them to be part of the transitional government. The US increased its support for the FNLA and for the first time took up funding of UNITA. On 18 July 1975, U.S. president Ford approved covert CIA operation 'IAFEATURE' to aid FNLA and UNITA with money (US30 million), arms and instructors. U.S. military instructors (CIA) arrived in southern Angola in early August, where they closely cooperated with their South African counterparts who arrived around the same time. The support involved the recruitment of mercenaries and an expanded propaganda campaign against the MPLA. Author Wayne Smith states that the U.S. 'was publicly committed to an embargo against the delivery of arms to Angolan factions while it was secretly launching a paramilitary programme'.South Africa, which was then under a white-minority rule known as Apartheid, soon came to be the closest allies of both UNITA and FNLA. Other western countries with their own clandestine support for FNLA and UNITA were Great Britain and France. Israel supported the FNLA from 1963 to 1969 and the FNLA sent members to Israel for training. Through the 1970s Israel shipped arms to the FNLA via Zaire.Some East Bloc countries and Yugoslavia first established ties with the MPLA in the early 1960s during its struggle against the Portuguese. The Soviet Union started modest military aid in the late 1960s. This support remained clandestine, came in trickles and sometimes ceased altogether. This was the case in 1972, when the MPLA came under strong pressure from the Portuguese and was torn apart by internal strife (struggle between MPLA leader António Agostinho Neto and Chipenda from 1972 to 1974). Soviet aid was suspended in 1973 with the exception of a few limited shipments in 1974 to counter Chinese support for the FNLA; only Yugoslavia continued to send supplies to the MPLA. In response to U.S. and Chinese support for the FNLA, Soviet support for the MPLA massively increased in March 1975 in the form of arms deliveries by air via Brazzaville and by sea via Dar-es-Salaam. Soviet assistance to the MPLA was always somewhat reluctant; they never fully trusted Neto and their relationship was to remain ambivalent through the following years. The Soviets preferred a political solution, but they did not want to see the MPLA marginalized. Even after the South African incursions the Soviets only sent arms, but no instructors for the use of the sophisticated weapons. Among the other Eastern Bloc countries the MPLA had well established contacts with East Germany and Romania, the former shipping large amounts of non-military supplies. Although being leftist, Neto was interested in an ideological balance in his foreign support, but in spite of 'overtures' well into 1975, he was unable to procure support for the MPLA from the U.S., thus becoming solely dependent on the eastern camp.Cuba and the MPLA before the Civil War Cuba's first informal contacts with the MPLA dated back to the late 1950s. MPLA guerrillas received their first training from Cubans in Algiers starting in 1963 and Che Guevara met MPLA-leader Agostinho Neto for the first high-level talks on 5 January 1965 in Brazzaville where Cuba was establishing a two-year military mission. This mission had the primary purpose to act as a strategic reserve for the Cuban operation in eastern Congo. It also was to provide assistance to the Alphonse Massemba-Débat government in Brazzaville and, at Neto's request, to the MPLA with its operations against the Portuguese in Cabinda and in northern Angola where its major foe was the FNLA. This co-operation marked the beginning of the Cuban-MPLA alliance which was to last 26 years.The MPLA-Cuban operations in Cabinda and northern Angola were met with very little success and the Cubans ended the mission to Brazzaville as planned in July 1966. The MPLA moved its headquarters to Lusaka in early 1968. A few MPLA guerrillas continued to receive military training in Cuba but else contacts between Cuba and the MPLA cooled as Havana turned its attention to the independence struggle in Guinea-Bissau. Following Castro's tour of African countries in May 1972 Cuba stepped up its internationalist operations in Africa starting a training mission in Sierra Leone and smaller technical missions in Equatorial Guinea, Somalia, Algeria and Tanzania.In a memorandum of 22 November 1972, the Cuban Major Manuel Piñeiro Lozada communicated to Raúl Castro the MPLA's request for small amounts of training and crew. These considerations in 1972 bore no fruit and Cuba's attentions remained focused on Guinea-Bissau. It was only after the Portuguese Revolution that an MPLA delegation brought a request for economic aid, military training and arms to Cuba on 26 July 1974. In early October Cuba received another request, this time more urgent, for five Cuban military officers to help organize the MPLA army, FAPLA. In December 1974 and January 1975, Cuba sent Major Alfonso Perez Morales and Carlos Cadelo on a fact finding mission to Angola to assess the situation. In a letter of 26 January 1975, handed to Cadelo and Morales, Neto listed what the MPLA wanted from Cuba, including 'The establishment, organization, and maintenance of a military school for cadres', 'A [Cuban] ship to transport the war materiel that we have in Dar-es-Salaam to Angola', 'Uniforms and military equipment for 10,000 men', and 'Financial assistance while we are establishing and organizing ourselves.'Although Cuba was considering the establishment of a military mission (military training) in Angola, again there was no official response to this request. It was only reiterated by the MPLA in May 1975 when Cuban commander Flavio Bravo met Neto in Brazzaville while the Portuguese were preparing to withdraw from their African colonies. The MPLA's hopes for aid were turned to the eastern Bloc countries from where not enough help materialised according to their wishes. Neto is quoted in a Cuban report complaining about Moscow's lacklustre support. He also expressed hope that the war in Angola would become 'a vital issue in the fight against imperialism and socialism'. But neither the Soviets nor the MPLA itself expected a major war to break out before independence. In March 1975 the MPLA sent of its 100 members for training in the Soviet Union and the requested financial assistance from Yugoslavia, who gave 100,000 dollars.South Africa intervenesPortugal's sudden retreat from Angola and Mozambique in 1975 ended a history of South African military and intelligence cooperation with Portugal against the Angolan and Namibian independence movements dating back to the 1960s, later formalized in a secret alliance codenamed Alcora Exercise. It also ended economic cooperation with regard to the Cunene hydro-project at the Angolan-Namibian border, which South Africa had financed.South African involvement in Angola, subsumed under what it called the South African Border War, started in 1966 when the conflict with the Namibian independence movement, South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), which at that time had its bases in Ovamboland and Zambia, first flared up. With the loss of the Portuguese as an ally and the establishment of pro-SWAPO communist rule in the two former colonies, the apartheid regime lost highly valued sections of its 'cordon sanitaire' (buffer zone) between itself and hostile black Africa. In the following years South Africa engaged in numerous military and economic activities in the region, backing RENAMO in the Mozambican Civil War, undertaking various measures at economic destabilization against Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, backing an unsuccessful mercenary intervention in the Seychelles in 1981, and supporting a coup in Lesotho in 1986. It was behind a coup attempt in Tanzania in 1983, provided support for rebels in Zimbabwe since independence, carried out raids against African National Congress offices in Maputo, Harare and Gaborone and conducted a counterinsurgency war in Namibia against SWAPO. SWAPO retreated to and operated from bases in Angola, and South Africa was confronted not only with the issue of having to cross another border in pursuit of SWAPO but also of another leftist government in the region. Unlike the other countries in the region, South Africa had no economic leverage on Angola, thus making military action the only possible means to exert any influence on the course of events.On 14 July 1975, South African Prime Minister John Vorster approved weapons worth US 14 million to be bought secretly for FNLA and UNITA. First arms shipments for FNLA and UNITA from South Africa arrived in August 1975.On 9 August 1975, a 30-man patrol of the South African Defence Force (SADF) moved some 50 km into southern Angola and occupied the Ruacana-Calueque hydro-electric complex and other installations on the Cunene River. Several hostile incidences with UNITA and SWAPO frightening foreign worker had been the pretext. The defence of the Calueque dam complex in southern Angola was South Africa's justification for the first permanent deployment of regular SADF units inside Angola.On 22 August 1975, the SADF launched operation 'Sausage II', a major raid against SWAPO in southern Angola. In addition, on 4 September 1975, Vorster authorized the provision of limited military training, advice and logistical support. In turn FNLA and UNITA would help the South Africans fighting SWAPO.Due to the recent MPLA's successes, UNITA's territory had been shrinking to parts of central Angola, and it became clear to South Africa that independence day would find the MPLA in control of Luanda; 'neither the United States nor South Africa were willing to accept that.' The SADF set up a training camp near Silva Porto and prepared the defences of Nova Lisboa (Huambo). They assembled the mobile attack unit 'Foxbat' to stop approaching FAPLA-units with which it clashed on 5 October, thus saving Nova Lisboa for UNITA.On 14 October, the South Africans secretly launched Operation Savannah when Task Force Zulu, the first of several South African columns, crossed from Namibia into Cuando Cubango. Southern Angola was in chaos with the three independence movements fighting each other for dominance. It took FAPLA some time, before it noticed who else it was up against and the SADF advanced very quickly. Task force Foxbat joined the intervention in mid-October. The operation provided for elimination of the MPLA from the southern border area, then from south western Angola, from the central region, and finally for the capture of Luanda.According author to Edward George, the South African government 'believed that by invading Angola it could install its proxies and shore up apartheid for the foreseeable future'. The United States had known of South Africa's military plans in advance. They encouraged the South Africans and co-operated with them, contrary to Secretary of State Henry Kissinger's testimony to Congress at the time, and in contrast to what President Ford told the Chinese, who supported the FNLA but were worried about South African engagement in Angola. According to John Stockwell, a former CIA officer, 'there was close liaison between the CIA and the South Africans'and ''high officials' in Pretoria claimed that their intervention in Angola had been based on an 'understanding' with the United States'.Cuban military mission On 3 August, a Cuban delegation traveled a second time to Angola to assess the situation, to draw up plans for the training programme as requested by Neto, and to hand over US100,000. Neto had complained 'of the little amount of aid from socialist countries and 'that the USSR detained aid to the MPLA in 1972, even though they told us that they are now helping with arms, but it's very little compared with their vast needs'. Arguelles agreed with Neto as he saw the sides in Angola 'clearly defined, that the FNLA and UNITA represented the international imperialist forces and the Portuguese reaction, and the MPLA represented the progressive and nationalist forces.'After the return of the delegation on 8 August, the Cubans considered the options of their instructors in Angola in case of an intervention by South Africa or Zaire which would be either 'guerrilla war' or withdrawal to Zambia, where Cuba proceeded to open an embassy. In a memorandum of 11 August 1975, Major Raúl Diaz Argüelles to Major Raúl Castro explained the reasons for the visit and briefed on the contents of the talks. He underlined that the attacks on the part of the FNLA and of Mobutu to the MPLA and the possible development of future actions until independence in the month of November was taken into account and the awareness that 'the reactionaries and the imperialists would try all possible methods to avoid having the forces of the MPLA take power'. The same day Argüelles proposed a 94-man mission to Castro. On 15 August, Castro urged the USSR to increase support for the MPLA, offered to send special troops and asked for assistance. The Russians declined.In view of the Zairian intervention in the north and the South African occupation of Ruacana-Calueque hydro-electric complex in the south, it was decided to staff the CIRs with almost 500 Cubans instead of the requested 100, which were to form about 4,800 FAPLA recruits into 16 infantry battalions, 25 mortar batteries and various anti-aircraft units in three to six months. These 500 men included 17 in a medical brigade and 284 officers. 'The decision to expand the operation reflected a feeling in Havana that … there had to be enough of them to fulfil their mission as well as defend themselves in the event the operation went awry. It was nevertheless clear that …they expected it (the mission) to be short term and to last around 6 months'.The dispatch of the Cuban volunteers started 21 August and an advance party with the most urgently needed specialists used international commercial flights. Small groups continued to trickle into Luanda on such flights as well as on Cuba's aging Britannia planes and the bulk arrived after a two-week trip aboard three Cuban cargo vessels; the first one, the 'Vietnam Heroico' docked at Porto Amboim on 5 October. The arrival of two Cuban ships in Angola with instructors on board was reported by the CIA and raised no alarm in Washington.The CIRs were placed in Cabinda, Benguela, Saurimo (formerly Henrique de Carvalho) and at N'Dalatando (formerly Salazar). The CIR in Cabinda accounted for almost half of the total, 191 men, while the others had 66 or 67 each. Some were posted in headquarters in Luanda or in other places throughout the country. The reason for the stronger detachment in Cabinda was the perceived threat from Zaire either to Cabinda or to the Congo. By the time the training centres were fully staffed and operational on 18–20 October, unnoticed by the world, Operation Savannah was already in full swing.In contrast to the successes in the south, where by mid October the MPLA had gained control of 12 of Angola's provinces and most urban centres, they only barely managed to keep the well equipped FNLA and its allies abreast on the northern front just east of Luanda. The FNLA was receiving arms and equipment from the U.S. via Zaire starting in the end of Julyand had been strengthened in September by the arrival of the Fourth and Seventh Zairian Commando Battalions. From July to November the front moved back and forth between Caxito and Quifangondo (Kifangondo). Neto asked the Soviet Union for more support which had no intention to send any staff before independence and only reluctantly sent more arms. The Cubans were busy dealing with the arrival of the contingents for the CIRs and it was only on 19 October that they paid sufficient attention to Luanda's precarious position. Realizing the threat they shut down the CIR at Salazar only 3 days after it started operating and deployed most of the recruits and Cuban instructors in Luanda. Forty instructors from the CIR Salazar were the first Cubans to become involved in the defence of Quifangondo on 23 October 1975 when they launched an unsuccessful assault one FNLA-Zairian forces at Morro do Cal. A second group supported the MPLA on 28 October along the same defence line to the east of Kifangondo.Yet unnoticed by the Cubans, the territory the MPLA had just gained in the south was quickly lost to the South African advances. After South African advisors and antitank weapons had helped to stop an MPLA advance on Nova Lisboa (Huambo) in early October, Zulu took Roçadas by 20 October, Sá da Bandeira by 24 October and Moçâmedes by 28 October.On 2–3 November, Cuban instructors for the third time got involved in the fighting, this time 51 men from the CIR Benguela, when they unsuccessfully tried to help the FAPLA stop the Zulu advance near Catengue. This first encounter between Cubans and South Africans also led to the first officially recognized Cuban fatalities. 'Their participation led Zulu-Commander Breytenbach to conclude that his troops were 'facing the best organized and heaviest FAPLA opposition to date''.Cuba's first interventionOperation Carlota It was only after the MPLA debacle at Catengue that the Cubans became fully aware of the South African intervention, that Luanda would be taken and that their training missions were in grave danger unless they took immediate action. Neto had requested immediate and massive reinforcements from Havana at the urging of Argüelles. On 4 November Castro decided to launch an intervention on an unprecedented scale, codenaming the mission Operation Carlota, after 'Black Carlota', the leader of a slave rebellion in 1843. The same day, a first plane with 100 heavy weapon specialists, which the MPLA had requested in September, left for Brazzaville, arriving in Luanda on 7 November. On 9 November the first two Cuban planes arrived in Luanda with the first 100 men of a contingent of a 652-strong battalion of elite Special Forces. The first priority of the Cubans was helping the MPLA to keep hold of Luanda. Fidel Castro explained the Cuban intervention: 'When the invasion of Angola by regular South African troops started 23 October, we could not sit idle. And when the MPLA asked us for help, we offered the necessary aid to prevent Apartheid from making itself comfortable in Angola'.With Operation Carlota, Cuba became a major player in the conflict. Unlike its foreign engagements in the sixties this was no secret operation. Castro decided to support the MPLA in all openness, sending special forces and 35,000 infantry by the end of 1976, deploying them at Cuba's own expense and with its own means from November 1975 to January 1976. As on its previous missions, all personnel were volunteers and the call-up was extremely popular.Air transportation for quick deployments proved to be a major problem. Cuba only had three ageing medium-range Bristol Britannia turboprop planes not fit to make 9,000 km non-stop transatlantic crossings. Nevertheless, between 7 November and 9 December the Cubans managed to run 70 reinforcement flights to Luanda. Initially they were able to make stops in Barbados, the Azores, or Newfoundland, prompting pressure from Washington to deny Cuba landing rights. But moving take-offs to Cuba's easternmost airport, Holguin, taking as little weight as necessary, and adding additional tanks, the planes were used for numerous runs across the ocean until the Soviets pitched in with long-distance jet planes.For the bulk of the troops and the equipment the Cubans commandeered all available ships in its merchant marine, the first three sailing from Havana on 8 November. They docked in Luanda on 27 and 29 November and 1 December bringing 1,253 troops and equipment.The deployment of troops was not pre-arranged with the USSR, as often reported and depicted by the US-administration. On the contrary, it also took the USSR by surprise. The Soviets were forced to accept the Cuban troop deployment so as not to endanger relations with their most important ally in close proximity to the United States. But they had in mind to keep a lid on the extent of the Cuban engagement and merely sent arms and a few specialists to Brazzaville and Dar-es-Salaam. It was only two months later after the fighting swung in favour of the Cubans and the U.S. passed the Clark Amendment that Moscow agreed to a degree of support by arranging for a maximum of 10 transport flights from Cuba to Angola.With the FNLA attacking from the east the situation for the MPLA only a few days before independence looked dim. In addition to this, Cabinda was under threat of takeover by a FLEC-Zairian force. The Cuban troops able to intervene before the declaration of independence on 11 November were basically the ones posted in the three CIRs, the 100 specialists that arrived in Luanda on 7 November and the first 164 special forces of Operation Carlota arriving on two planes on the evening of 8 November. The 100 specialists and 88 men of the special forces were immediately dispatched to the nearby front at Quifangondo where the FNLA-Zairian force had launched an assault that very morning. They supported 850 FAPLA, 200 Katangans and one Soviet advisor. First heavy weapons had already arrived from Cuba by ship on 7 November, among them cannons, mortars and 6 BM-21 (Katyusha) multiple rocket launchers. The Cubans received reports that the expected invasion of Cabinda had started on the morning of 8 November.Northern front and Cabinda The invasion of Cabinda was conducted by three FLEC and one Zairian infantry battalions under the command of 150 French and American mercenaries. The MPLA's had the 232 Cubans of the CIR, a freshly trained and an untrained FAPLA infantry battalion at its disposal. In the ensuing battle for Cabinda from 8–13 November they managed to repel the invasion without support from Operation Carlota, thus saving the exclave for the MPLA.Two days before independence the most imminent danger for the MPLA came from the northern front where the FNLA and its allies stood east of Quifangondo. 2,000 FNLA troops were supported by two battalions of Zairian infantry troops (1,200 men), 120 Portuguese mercenaries, a few resident advisors, among them a small CIA contingent, and 52 South Africans led by General Ben de Wet Roos. They were manning the artillery provided by the SADF which had been flown into Ambriz only two days before.After artillery bombardment on Luanda and Quifangondo through the night and a bombing raid by the South African air force in the early hours the final attack of the FNLA was launched on the morning of 10 November. The attacking force was ambushed and destroyed by the FAPLA-Cuban forces. Cuban forces also bombarded their South African and FNLA enemies with BM-21 Grad rocket launchers which had been put into place only the night before, and were well out of range of the antiquated South African guns. The defeat of the FNLA in the Battle of Quifangondo secured the capital for the MPLA. On the same day the Portuguese handed over power 'to the people of Angola' and shortly after midnight Neto proclaimed independence and the formation of the 'People's Republic of Angola'. Urged by the CIA and other clandestine foreign services, the FNLA and UNITA announced the proclamation of a Democratic People's Republic with the temporary capital at Huambo. Yet, UNITA and FNLA could not agree on a united government and fighting between them already broke out in Huambo on the eve of independence day. On the day of independence the MPLA held little more than the capital and a strip of central Angola inland toward Zaire and the exclave of Cabinda. On 4 December the FAPLA-Cubans launched a counter-offensive against the FNLA. But with Luanda and Cabinda secured and the defeat of the FNLA at Quifangondo they could finally turn more attention to the south.Cuba operated independently through December and January bringing in their troops in slowly, but steadily. Two months after the start of Operation Carlota the Soviets agreed to ten charter flights on long-range IL-62 jet airliners, starting on 8 January. This was followed one week later by an agreement that 'the Soviets would supply all future weaponry … transporting it directly to Angola so that the Cuban airlift could concentrate on personnel.'By early February, with increasing numbers in Cuban troops and sophisticated weaponry, the tide changed in favour of the MPLA. The final offensive in the North started on 1 January 1976. By 3 January FAPLA-Cuban forces took the FNLA air bases of Negage and Camabatela and a day later the FNLA capital of Carmona. A last-ditch attempt by FNLA to use foreign mercenaries enlisted by the CIA (see next chapter: U.S. response) failed; on 11 January FAPLA-Cubans captured Ambriz and Ambrizete (N'zeto) an on 15 February the FNLA's last foothold, São Salvador. By late February one Cuban and 12 FAPLA and battalions had completely annihilated the FNLA, driving what was left of them and the Zairian army across the border. The South African contingent on the northern front had already been evacuated by ship on 28 November. The last mercenaries left northern Angola by 17 January.U.S. response It was several days before the U.S. realised the severity of the FNLA defeat at Quifangondo, but even then had little idea of the extent of the Cuban involvement. The news from the southern front was, in their view, still positive. Kissinger, like the South Africans, was shaken by the scale of the Soviet and Cuban response. The CIA's Angolan task force at CIA headquarters at Langley had been so confident of success by the Zairian and South African regulars, that on 11 November the members had celebrated Angolan independence with wine and cheese in their offices. The U.S. had not commented on the South African intervention in Angola but denounced the Cuban intervention when it first acknowledged Cuban troops in Angola in an official statement on 24 November 1975. Kissinger said 'that US efforts at rapprochement with Cuba would end should 'Cuban armed intervention in the affairs of other nations struggling to decide their own fate' continue.' On 28 February 1976, Ford called Castro 'an international outlaw' and the Cuban intervention a 'flagrant act of aggression'.Due to the hostility between the U.S. and Cuba, the Americans regarded such an air by the Cubans as a defeat which could not be accepted. The U.S. assumed that the USSR was behind the Cuban interference. On 9 December Ford asked the Soviets to suspend the airlift, still assuming it was a Soviet-run operation. The Americans also depicted the motivations and timings of the Cubans differently: They claimed that South Africa had to intervene after Cuba sent troops in support of the MPLA and that the war in Angola was a major new challenge to US power by an expansionist Moscow newly confident following communist victories in the Vietnam War. Only years later did it become clear to them that the Cubans acted on their own behalf.Castro responded to the U.S. reaction: 'Why were they vexed? Why had they planned everything to take possession of Angola before 11 November? Angola is a country rich in resources. In Cabinda there is lots of oil. Some imperialists wonder why we help the Angolans, which interests we have. They are used to thinking that one country helps another one only when it wants its oil, copper, diamonds or other resources. No, we are not after material interests and it is logical that this is not understood by the imperialist. They only know chauvinistic, nationalistic and selfish criteria. By helping the people of Angola we are fulfilling a fundamental duty of Internationalism.On 3 December 1975, in a meeting with officials from the U.S. and China including Deng Xiaoping (Vice Premier and deputy of Mao Zedong), Qiao Guanhua (Foreign Minister), President Gerald Ford, Henry Kissinger (Secretary of State/Foreign Minister), Brent Scowcroft (Assistant to the President for NSA) and George H. W. Bush (Chief of U.S. Liaison Office in Peking) international issues were discussed, one of them being Angola. Although China had supported the MPLA in the past, they now sided with the FNLA and UNITA. China was especially concerned about African sensitivities and pride and considered South African involvement as the primary and relative complex problem. Kissinger responded, that the U.S. is prepared to 'push out South Africa as soon as an alternative military force can be created'. It is in this meeting that President Ford told the Chinese: 'We had nothing to do with the South African involvement, and we will take action to get South Africa out, provided a balance can be maintained for their not being in'. He also said that he had approved US35 million more (in support of the north) above what had been done before. They discussed and agreed who should support the FNLA or UNITA by which means and in what manner taking into account the sensitivities of the neighbouring countries.It was only when the U.S. administration asked Congress for US28 million for IAFEATURE that Congress really paid attention to the events in Angola. By then 'the evidence of the South African invasion was overwhelming and the stench of US-collusion with Pretoria hung in the air. Worse, the growing numbers of Cuban troops had derailed the CIA's plans and the administration seemed at a loss what to do next.' The money was not approved and on 20 December 1975, the U.S. Senate passed an amendment banning covert assistance to anti-Communist forces and curtailing CIA involvement in Angola. Later that winter, an amendment to the foreign aid bill sponsored by Dick Clark extended the ban. (Clark Amendment) The U.S. administration resorted to other means of support for FNLA and UNITA of which one was raising mercenaries. The CIA initiated a covert programme to recruit recruit Brazilians and Europeans to fight in the north of Angola. Altogether they managed to enlist around 250 men, but by the time meaningful numbers arrived in January 1975 the campaign in the north was all but over. Other ways of continued support for the FNLA and UNITA were through South Africa and other U.S. allied states such as Israel and Morocco.A report by Henry Kissinger of 13 January 1976 gives an insight into the activities and hostilities in Angola, inter alia:'US intelligence estimated that by December 20 there were 5,000 to 6,000 Cubans in Angola.' 'Cuban sources, however, indicate that the number hovered around 3,500 to 4,000.' This more or less would have put the Cubans at par with the South Africans on the southern front. Gabriel García Márquez wrote that Kissinger remarked to Venezuelan President Carlos Andrés Pérez: 'Our intelligence services have grown so bad that we only found out that Cubans were being sent to Angola after they were already there.' At that moment, there were many Cuban troops, military specialists and civilian technicians in Angola — more even than Kissinger imagined. Indeed, there were so many ships anchored in the bay of Luanda that by February 1976 Neto said to a functionary close to him: 'It's not right', if they go on like that, the Cubans will ruin themselves.' It is unlikely that even the Cubans had foreseen that their intervention would reach such proportions. It had been clear to them right from the start, however, that the action had to be swift, decisive, and at all costs successful. But one result of the events in Angola in 1976 was the American's heightened attention to African affairs, especially in the south of the continent. Kissinger worried, 'if the Cubans are involved there, Namibia is next and after that South Africa itself.' With the need to distance themselves from outcasts in the eyes of black Africa this also meant the U.S. would drop support for the white regime in Rhodesia, a price it was willing to pay to 'thwart communism'.International press coverage The South Africans had managed to keep their intervention hidden from world view for quite some time. It even took the MPLA until 23 October 1975 to notice that not white mercenaries but the SADF was advancing on Luanda. Yet it took another whole month for the world press to take notice: A day after the South African coastal advance was stopped, two correspondents from Reuters and British Independent Television News published news that South Africans were fighting in Angola. On 23 November 1975 a major Western newspaper, the Washington Post, announced that regular South African troops were fighting inside Angola. Although other papers were still slow to follow, e.g., the New York Times on 12 December, the fact eventually became internationally known. The South African public had also been kept in the dark, and only on 19 December learned more about what was called the 'Border War' when papers published pictures of SADF soldiers captured by FAPLA and the Cubans.Southern frontSADF advance is stoppedBy the time FAPLA and the Cubans were able to turn more attention to the southern front after the battle of Quifangondo, the South Africans had gained considerable ground. On 6 and 7 November 1975, Task Force Zulu took the harbour cities of Benguela and Lobito which had been unexpectedly abandoned. The towns and cities taken by the SADF were handed over to UNITA. In central Angola, at the same time, combat unit Foxbat had moved 800 km north toward Luanda. By then it became clear that Luanda could not be taken by independence day on 11 November and the South Africans considered to break off the advance and retreat. But on 10 November 1975 Vorster gave in to UNITA's urgent request to keep up the military pressure with the aim of capturing as much territory as possible before the upcoming meeting of the OAU. Thus, Zulu and Foxbat continued north with two new battle groups formed further inland (X-Ray and Orange) and 'there was little reason to think the FAPLA would be able to stop this expanded force from capturing Luanda within a week.'Through November and December 1975, the SADF presence in Angola numbered 2,900 to 3,000 personnel.Zulu now faced stronger resistance advancing on Novo Redondo after which fortunes changed in favour of the FAPLA and the Cubans. The first Cuban reinforcements arrived in Porto Amboim, only a few km north of Novo Redondo, quickly destroying three bridges crossing the Queve river, effectively stopping the South African advance along the coast on 13 November 1975. Despite concerted efforts to advance north to Novo Redondo, the SADF was unable to break through FAPLA defences. In a last successful advance a South African task force and UNITA troops took Luso on the Benguela railway on 11 December which they held until 27 December.By mid-December, South Africa extended military service and called in reserves. 'An indication of the seriousness of the situation …. is that one of the most extensive military call-ups in South African history is now taking place'. By late December, Cuba had deployed 3,500 to 4,000 troops in Angola, of which 1,000 were securing Cabindaand eventually the tide turned in favour of the MPLA. Apart from being 'bogged down' on the southern front, South Africa had to deal with two other major setbacks: the international press taking note of the operation and the shift in U.S. policies.South Africa withdraws In light of these developments, Pretoria had to decide whether it would stay in the game and bring in more troops. In late December 1975, there were heated debates between Vorster, foreign minister Muller, defence minister Botha, head of BOSS (South African Bureau of State Security) van den Bergh and a number of senior officials as to withdraw or to stay. Zaire, UNITA and the U.S. urged South Africa to stay. But the U.S. would not openly endorse the South African intervention and assure continuing military assistance in case of an escalation.On 30 December 1975, Vorster planned to withdraw after the OAU emergency session in Addis Ababa on 13 January 1976 to a line 50 to 80 km north of the Namibian border. 'In military terms the advance had come to a halt anyway, as all attempts by Battle-Groups Orange and X-Ray to extend the war into the interior had been forced to turn back by destroyed bridges.'In early January 1976, the Cubans launched a first counter-offensive driving Foxbat from the Tongo and Medunda hills. The OAU meeting which the South Africans had hopes for finally debated the Angola issue and voted on 23 January 1976, condemning the South African intervention and demanding its withdrawal. Sobered by the Cubans' performance and by the West's cold shoulder, Pretoria chose to fold and ordered the retreat of its troops from Angola.The sentiment of the Pretoria government at the time was expressed in a speech by Botha before South African parliament on 17 April 1978, in which he charged the U.S. with 'defaulting on a promise to give them all necessary support in their campaign to defeat the MPLA': 'Against which neighbouring states have we taken aggressive steps? I know of only one occasion in recent years, when we crossed a border and that was in the case of Angola when we did so with the approval and knowledge of the Americans. But they left us in the lurch. We are going to retell that story: the story must be told and how we, with their knowledge, went in there and operated in Angola with their knowledge, how they encouraged us to act and, when we had nearly reached the climax, we were ruthlessly left in the lurch'.Once the decision was made, South Africa rapidly withdrew its forces towards Namibia. In late January, the SADF abandoned the towns of Cela and Novo RedondoApart from a few skirmishes, the Cubans stayed well behind the retreating South Africans and easily overcame the remaining UNITA resistance. By early February 1976, the SADF had retreated to the far south of Angola, leaving behind mine fields and blown up bridges. UNITA's capital, Nova Lisboa (Huambo) fell into FAPLA hands on 8 February, the ports of Lobito and Benguela on 10 February. By 14 February, control of the Benguala railway was complete and on 13 March UNITA lost its last foothold in far south-eastern Angola, Gago Gouthinho (Lumbala N'Guimbo). It is in this attack that the Cubans for the first time employed their airforce.Four to five thousand SADF troops kept a strip along the Namibian border up to 80 km deep until Angola at least gave assurance that it wouldn't supply bases for SWAPO and that it would continue to supply electricity to Namibia from the Cunene dams. While the Cubans and FAPLA were slowly approaching the southern border, South Africa and the MPLA took up indirect negotiations about South African withdrawal brokered by the British and Soviet governments. Neto ordered FAPLA and the Cubans to halt at a distance to the border, forestalling what some feared might turn into a much bigger conflict. In exchange for South African recognition, he offered to guarantee the safety of South Africa's 180 million USinvestment in the Cunene hydroelectric complex in northwest Namibia, close to the Angolan border. On 25 March, Botha announced the total withdrawal of South African troops from Angola by 27 March 1976. On 27 March, the last 60 military vehicles crossed the border into Namibia.Consolidation With the withdrawal of South Africa, FNLA and UNITA resistance crumbled and the MPLA was left in sole possession of power. With the help of its Cuban allies the MPLA 'not only vanquished its bitterest rivals – the FNLA and UNITA – but in the process had seen off the CIA and humbled the mighty Pretoria war machine.' Whatever remained of UNITA retreated into the Angolan bush and Zaire. A number of African countries publicly discredited UNITA for its links with the apartheid government, the CIA and white mercenaries.The United Nations Security Council met to consider 'the act of aggression committed by South Africa against the People's Republic of Angola' and on 31 March 1976, branded South Africa the aggressor, demanding it provide compensation for war damages. Internationally South Africa found itself completely isolated and the failure of its Operation Savannah left it 'without a single crumb of comfort'. 'The internal repercussions of the Angolan debacle were felt quickly when, on 16 June 1976 – emboldened by the FAPLA-Cuban victory – the Soweto Uprising began, inaugurating a period of civil unrest which was to continue up until and beyond the collapse of apartheid.' Another setback for Pretoria within four years was the end of white minority rule in Rhodesia as it emerged as the next black majority-ruled nation of Zimbabwe, completing the total geographic isolation of apartheid South Africa. Angola obtained recognition by the OAU on 10 February 1976. The OAU recognized the MPLA as Angola's government. The majority of the international community albeit not the U.S. soon did the same. The U.S. was unable to prevent its admittance to the UN General Assembly as its 146th member.At the height of the deployment in 1976, Cuba had 36,000 military personnel stationed in Angola. At their meeting in Conakry on 14 March 1976, when victory was already assured, Castro and Neto decided that the Cubans would withdraw gradually, leaving behind for as long as necessary enough men to organize a strong, modern army, capable of guaranteeing the MPLA's future security without outside help. The Cubans had no intention of getting bogged down in a lengthy internal counter-insurgency and started to reduce their presence in Angola as planned after the retreat of the South Africans. By the end of May, more than 3,000 troops had already returned to Cuba, and many more were on the way. By the end of the year the Cuban troops had been reduced to 12,000.The Cubans had high hopes that after their victory in Angola, in co-operation with the USSR, they could remove all of southern Africa from the influence of the U.S. and China. In Angola, they put up dozens of training camps for Namibian (SWAPO), Rhodesian (ZAPU) and South African (ANC) guerrillas. An SADF intelligence report in 1977 concluded 'that SWAPO's standard of training had improved significantly because of the training they had received from the Cuban instructors'. Cuba saw its second main task in training and equipping the FAPLA which the Soviets generously supplied with sophisticated weapons including tanks and an own air force with MiG-21 fighters.In early 1977, the new Carter administration had in mind to recognize the MPLA-government despite of the presence of Cuban troops assuming they would be withdrawn once the Namibian issue was settled and the southern border of Angola was secure. The MPLA and Cuban troops had control over all southern cities by 1977, but roads in the south faced repeated UNITA attacks. Savimbi expressed his willingness for rapprochement with the MPLA and the formation of a unity, socialist government, but he insisted on Cuban withdrawal first. 'The real enemy is Cuban colonialism,' Savimbi told reporters, warning, 'The Cubans have taken over the country, but sooner or later they will suffer their own Vietnam in Angola.'On the international stage, Cuba's victory against South Africa boosted Castro's image as one of the top leaders in the Non-Aligned Movement of which he was secretary-general from 1979 to 1983. Although with Cuba's help the MPLA-government became firmly established, Cuban attempts to hand over the defence of the country failed and it soon became drawn into MPLA's war against UNITA.Humanitarian engagement According to the Cubans, the overriding priority of their mission in Angola was humanitarian, not military. In the wake of Operation Carlota, around 5,000 Cuban technical, medical and educational staff were constantly posted in Angola to fill the gaps the Portuguese had left behind. 'For a generation of Cubans, internationalist service in Angola represented the highest ideal of the Cuban Revolution' and for many it became a normal part of life to volunteer for an internationalist mission, principally in Angola, which lasted 18 to 24 months. In the following years, tens of thousands of volunteers were processed each year. By 1978, Angola's health system was almost completely run by Cuban doctors. After the Portuguese left the country, there was only one doctor per 100,000 inhabitants. The Cubans posted a large medical team at Luanda's University and Prenda hospitals and opened clinics in remote areas all across Angola.At the time of independence, over 90", "machine_text": "Cuban intervention in Angola refers to the involvement of the Cuban military in the Angolan Civil War (1975-2002). After gaining independence from Portugal in 1975, Angola was engulfed in a bitter struggle between pro-communist and anti-communist factions. The Soviet Union and Cuba supported the Marxist-Leninist People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), while the United States and South Africa backed the rival National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA). In November 1975, the MPLA declared independence and formed a socialist government, but it faced a serious threat from UNITA and other rival groups. At the request of the MPLA, Cuba sent military advisers to assist the Angolan government in its battle against UNITA. Later in 1975, Cuba sent several thousand combat troops to Angola, marking the beginning of a major military intervention. The Cuban troops, equipped with Soviet weapons and hardware, played a crucial role in the Angolan War. They fought alongside MPLA forces against UNITA and South African troops, who were also present in Angola to support the anti-communist rebels. Over the next decade, Cuban forces helped the MPLA government gain control of much of Angola and secure its borders against external threats. The Cuban intervention in Angola was a significant Cold War proxy conflict, as it pitted the Soviet Union and its allies against the United States and its supporters. It also had important implications for the African continent, as it helped to shape the political and military landscape in Angola and beyond. The Cuban presence in Angola officially ended in 1991 with the signing of a peace accord, although some Cuban troops remained in Angola until 1999.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 14924212}

Born and raised in northern New Jersey, he moved to Philadelphia after graduating from college. After a successful career in Philadelphia real estate, he entered politics for the first time in 2015, being elected to the Philadelphia City Council.Early life and education Domb was born in 1955 in Jersey City, New Jersey, the second son of Edward Domb and Betty Schlesinger Domb. Domb's father and grandfather worked in the embroidery business. The family relocated to nearby Fort Lee, New Jersey soon after Domb's birth. Domb and his older brother, Peter, embarked on a series of odd jobs from a young age, shining shoes, shoveling snow, and mowing lawns. He graduated from Fort Lee High School in 1973 and started college at American University in Washington, D.C. Domb took evening classes there and worked full-time selling security systems for Phelps Time Lock Service in Hyattsville, Maryland. He graduated in 1977 with a marketing degree and continued to work for Phelps, being transferred to Philadelphia to manage the company's office in that city.Business career To earn extra money while managing the Phelps office, Domb earned a real estate license at Temple University. As the real estate business became more profitable, he quit the security business job and sold real estate full time, opening his own office in 1983. Domb specialized in real estate near Philadelphia's Rittenhouse Square and soon became well-known among property buyers and sellers in that neighborhood. He was elected president of the Greater Philadelphia Association of Realtors (GPAR) in 1990, the youngest president that organization had ever elected. After success in real estate sales, Domb expanded into real estate development in 1999, and worked with restaurateur Stephen Starr to develop restaurants in Philadelphia.Domb was again elected president of the GPAR in 2013, by which time he had acquired the nickname 'Philly Condo King.' In his second term as GPAR president, he worked with Mayor Michael Nutter and the city government on ideas to collect delinquent property taxes and attract new residents to the city. He also worked with City Council President Darrell L. Clarke to determine the market value and ultimate disposition of some of the city's inactive school buildings. Even after entering politics, Domb remained active in the real estate business, purchasing a 19-story office building in April 2016.Political career Nutter was term-limited, so the office of mayor would be open in the 2015 election. Domb, a registered independent, was said to be 'testing the waters' as a possibly independent or Republican candidate for mayor. Instead, in May of that year, Domb announced he would run as a Democrat for one of the city's seven at-large council seats. Pledging some of his vast personal wealth to the cause, Domb described his goals in office: 'We will talk about collecting taxes from out-of-state landlords and using that money to fund our schools. New job training programs. And partnering with our universities to mentor our children.'In the primary election that month, Domb placed third, winning one of the five Democratic nominations. In the general election in the majority-Democratic city, Domb again placed third, earning a seat on the council. In office, Domb continued to search for solution to the city's large number of tax-delinquent properties.See also List of members of Philadelphia City Council since 1952ReferencesSources1955 births Living people People from Fort Lee, New Jersey Businesspeople from Jersey City, New Jersey American University alumni American real estate businesspeople Temple University alumni Businesspeople from Pennsylvania Pennsylvania Democrats Philadelphia City Council members Politicians from Jersey City, New Jersey Fort Lee High School alumni", "machine_text": "Allan Domb is a prominent real estate agent and businessman based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Tightrope walking\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Tightrope walking, also called funambulism, is the skill of walking along a thin wire or rope. It has a long tradition in various countries and is commonly associated with the circus. Other skills similar to tightrope walking include slack rope walking and slacklining.TypesTightwire is the skill of maintaining balance while walking along a tensioned wire between two points. It can be done either using a balancing tool (umbrella, fan, balance pole, etc.) or 'freehand', using only one's body to maintain balance. Typically, tightwire performances either include dance or object manipulation. Object manipulation acts include a variety of props in their acts, such as clubs, rings, hats, or canes. Tightwire performers have even used wheelbarrows with passengers, ladders, and animals in their act. The technique to maintain balance is to keep the performer's centre of mass above their support point—usually their feet.Highwire is a form of tightwire walking but performed at much greater height. Although there is no official height when tightwire becomes highwire, generally a wire overhigh are regarded as a highwire act.Skywalk is a form of highwire which is performed at great heights and length. A skywalk is performed outdoors between tall buildings, gorges, across waterfalls or other natural and man-made structures.Ropes If the 'lay' of the rope (the orientation of the constituent strands, the 'twist' of a rope) is in one direction, the rope can twist on itself as it stretches and relaxes. Underfoot, this could be hazardous to disastrous in a tightrope. One solution is for the rope core to be made of steel cable, laid in the opposite direction to the outer layers, so that twisting forces balance each other out.Biomechanics Acrobats maintain their balance by positioning their centre of mass directly over their base of support, i.e. shifting most of their weight over their legs, arms, or whatever part of their body they are using to hold them up. When they are on the ground with their feet side by side, the base of support is wide in the lateral direction but narrow in the sagittal (back-to-front) direction. In the case of highwire-walkers, their feet are parallel with each other, one foot positioned in front of the other while on the wire. Therefore, a tightwire walker's sway is side to side, their lateral support having been drastically reduced.In both cases, whether side by side or parallel, the ankle is the pivot point.A wire-walker may use a pole for balance or may stretch out his arms perpendicular to his trunk in the manner of a pole. This technique provides several advantages. It distributes mass away from the pivot point, thereby increasing the moment of inertia. This reduces angular acceleration, so a greater torque is required to rotate the performer over the wire. The result is less tipping. In addition, the performer can also correct sway by rotating the pole. This will create an equal and opposite torque on the body.Tightwire-walkers typically perform in very thin and flexible, leather-soled slippers with a full-length suede or leather sole to protect the feet from abrasions and bruises, while still allowing the foot to curve around the wire. Though very infrequent in performance, amateur, hobbyist, or inexperienced funambulists will often walk barefoot so that the wire can be grasped between the big and second toe. This is more often done when using a rope, as the softer and silkier fibres are less taxing on the bare foot than the harder and more abrasive braided wire.Famous tightrope artistsCharles Blondin, a.k.a.

For instance, politicians are said to 'walk a tightrope' when trying to balance two opposing views with little room for compromise. The term can also be used in satirical or acidic contexts. Nicholas Taleb uses the phrase in his book The Black Swan. 'You get respect for doing funambulism or spectator sports'. Taleb is criticising scientists who prefer popularism to vigorous research and those who walk a fixed and narrow path rather than explore a large field of empirical study.See alsoReferencesCircus skills", "machine_text": "Tightrope walking is the act of walking or performing acrobatic maneuvers on a thin wire or rope, typically stretched between two anchor points. This thrilling and dangerous activity has been practiced for centuries, with its roots in ancient China and Greece. The art of tightrope walking requires a great deal of skill, balance, and concentration. Performers must carefully step one foot in front of the other while maintaining their center of gravity. The tightrope itself is often made of steel or wire and can vary in thickness and tension. The distance between the anchor points can range from a few feet to hundreds of feet, adding to the difficulty and excitement of the performance. Tightrope walking has been performed by many famous artists and daredevils, including Philippe Petit, who famously walked a tightrope between the two towers of the World Trade Center in 1974. Nik Wallenda, part of the famous Wallenda family of tightrope walkers, has also performed many incredible stunts, including walking across the Grand Canyon and Niagara Falls on a tightrope. While tightrope walking may seem like a death-defying activity, performers take many precautions to ensure their safety. They often use a balancing pole to help maintain their balance and may wear safety harnesses and nets for protection. However, accidents can and do happen, making tightrope walking a high-risk endeavor. Despite the danger involved, tightrope walking continues to captivate audiences around the world. Whether performed at a circus or as a solo act, it remains a thrill-seeking spectacle that showcases the incredible talent and bravery of its performers.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 511445}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Ptolemais in Phoenicia\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Ptolemais was an ancient port city on the Canaanite coast in Palestine region. It was also called Ptolemais in Canaan (or Akko, Ake, or Akre in Canaanite Language. It was an Ancient bishopric, which became a double Catholic titular see.In the Middle Ages, it was known as Acre amongst some Western European crusaders, who started a new, militantly Latin chapter there.HistoryGreek historians refer to the city as Ake (), meaning 'cure.' According to the Greek myth, Heracles found curative herbs here to heal his wounds. Josephus calls it Akre. The name was changed to Antiochia Ptolemais () shortly after Alexander the Great's conquest, and then to Ptolemais, probably by Ptolemy I Soter, after the Wars of the Diadochi lead to the partition of the kingdom of Alexander the Great and its inclusion first into the Egypt-based Lagid empire, then in the Seleucid Empire.Around 37 BC, the Romans conquered the Hellenized Phoenician port-city called Akko. It became a colony in southern Roman Phoenicia, called Colonia Claudia Felix Ptolemais Garmanica Stabilis. Ptolemais stayed Roman for nearly seven centuries until 636 AD, when was conquered by the Muslim Arabs. Under Augustus, a gymnasium was built in the city. In 4 BC, the Roman proconsul Publius Quinctilius Varus assembled his army there in order to suppress the revolts that broke out in the region following the death of Herod the Great.During the rule of the emperor Claudius there was a building drive in Ptolemais and veterans of the legions settled here. The city was one of four colonies (with Berytus, Aelia Capitolina and Caesarea Maritima) created in ancient Levant by Roman emperors for veterans of their Roman legions. As a result, Claudius granted the title 'Colonia Claudia Felix Ptolemais Garmanica Stabilis'.The city was a center of Romanization in the region, but most of the population was made of local Phoenicians and Jews: as a consequence after the Hadrian times the descendants of the initial Roman colonists were no more speaking Latin and were fully assimilated in less than two centuries (however the local society's customs were Roman).In 66 AD Gessius Florus, the Roman Procurator of Judea, conducted an initial massacre of the Jews living in the city. The next year Vespasian, the Roman military commander (soon to be emperor), accompanied by his son Titus, moved from Akko-Ptolemais to suppress the Jewish rebellion in Galilee.In 130 AD the port of Ptolemais was used as a base for the Roman Legions setting forth to suppress the Bar-Kochba revolt. After the destruction of Jerusalem many Jews settled in Ptolemais, that was losing its original Phoenician characteristics since Augustus times.In 190 AD Christianity started to be important in the city: Clarus, the Bishop of Ptolemais, participated in a council of Christian leaders. Ptolemais grew to be an important port in the eastern Mediterranean sea of the Roman empire. After Hadrian times Ptolemais was the commercial centerport of Jewish Galilee and was starting to be no more part of Phoenicia.In 351 AD Constantius Gallus suppressed a Jewish rebellion and did a small massacre of the Jews of Akko-Ptolemais (who were starting to be the majority of the city's population and rejected Roman domination).Under Byzantine control the city lost importance and around 636 AD was conquered by the Arab Amr ibn al-Aas. Following the defeat of the Byzantine army of Heraclius by the Muslim army of Khalid ibn al-Walid in the Battle of Yarmouk, and the capitulation of the Christian city of Jerusalem to the Caliph Umar, Ptolemais was ruledby the Rashidun Caliphate beginning in 638 AD.Christianity centerPtolemais was an important center of early Christianity in the region. Saint Paul visited the city at the end of his third missionary journey.Towards the end of the third century, Ptolemais was a predominantly Christian city, but with a large Jewish community. An unidentified visitor from Italy reported that in the sixth century the city had beautiful churches. Indeed, an important discovery was made in 2011: a Byzantine church in the middle of Crusaders' 'San Giovanni d'Acri' (as was called Ptolemais in the Middle Ages).Ecclesiastical HistoryBishops of Ptolemais in SyriaThe Apostle Paul, returning from his trip to Macedonia and Achea, landed at Tyre, and from there sailed to Ptolemais, where he stayed some days with the local Christian community (Acts 21.7).Ptolemais became of suffragan of the Metropolitan Archbishopric of Tyre.The first bishop known is Clarus, who in 190 AD attended a Council meeting which saw some bishops of Phoenicia and Palestine to deal with the issue of the date of the Easter feast. But we must go back to the fourth century to find the next Bishop, Enea, who took part at the first Council of Nicaea in 325 AD and at the Synod held in Antioch in 341 AD. Nectabus was one of the fathers of the first Ecumenical Council of Constantinople in 381 AD. Between the 4th and 5th centuries lived Bishop Antiochus, opponent of John Chrysostom. Helladius participated in the first Council of Ephesus in 431 AD. Paul took part in the Council held at Antioch of 445 AD to judge the work of Athanasius of Perrhe and at the Council of Chalcedon of 451 AD. In 518 AD Bishop John signed a Synodal letter against Severus of Antioch and the Monophysite party. Finally, the last known Bishop of Ptolemais is George, who attended the second Council of Constantinople in 553 AD.It faded after Islam was established in Greater Syria in the 7th century by the first Caliphs, conquering the Sassanid satrapy.CRUSADERS In the 12th century, the Crusaders started all over in their Kingdom of Jerusalem. From 1107 - 1190 AD including a Latin Catholic Diocese of Acre. Then reconquered in the 13th century for another further decades of Christian domination with Jewish communities peacefully living together.Titular seesLong after the Crusader states had perished, the Catholic church nominally restored the see (linked to the Acre succession) as a titular see, actually twice, in different rite-specific branches.Latin titular seeEstablished by nominal restoration as Episcopal Titular bishopric of Ptolemais (Latin) / Tolemaide (Curiate Italian)Gained 'territory' (i.e. apostolic succession) in 1870? from the suppressed Episcopal Titular bishopric of Acre (Akka), but suppressed circa 1895Restored and promoted in 1909 as Titular archbishopric of Ptolemais (Latin) / Tolemaide (Italian)Demoted back in 1925 as Episcopal Titular bishopric of Ptolemais (Latin) / Tolemaide (Italian; in 1926 renamed as Tolemaide di Fenicia)Renamed in 1933 as Titular bishopric of Ptolemais in Phœnicia (Latin) / Tolemaide di Fenicia (Italian) / Ptolemaiden(sis) in Phœnicia (Latin adjective)It is vacant sincedecades, having had the following incumbents, so far of the (mostly fitting) Episcopal, i.e. lowest) rank (with an archiepiscopal exception) :Carolus Ludovicus Hugo, Norbertines (O.

The city played a significant role in the Hellenistic and Roman periods and was named after Ptolemy II Philadelphus, ruler of Egypt in the early third century BCE. The city was founded in the 3rd century BCE by the Seleucid king, Alexander the Great's former general, and rival, Seleucus Nicator, who also founded the nearby city of Antioch. Ptolemais was strategically located along the coast between Tyre and Akko, and quickly became a major trading center, linking the Mediterranean world to Persia and India. During the Hellenistic period, Ptolemais was culturally and politically influenced by the Greeks, and the city flourished under the Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt. In the Roman period, Ptolemais continued to prosper as a center of trade and commerce, and was known for its wine, olives, and textiles. The city was a center of Christian activity in the early centuries of the Common Era. According to legend, Saint Peter visited the city and preached there, and it is mentioned in the Book of Acts as the place where Saint Paul landed on his journey to Jerusalem. Ptolemais was destroyed by an earthquake in the 4th century CE, and later was conquered by the Muslim armies of the Umayyad caliphate. The city was rebuilt by the Crusaders in the 12th century CE, and was known then as Saint-Jean d'Acre. Today, the ancient city of Ptolemais is a popular tourist destination, featuring many archaeological sites and landmarks.

CE 89–158), courtesy name Shushi (), was a Chinese poet during the Eastern Han dynasty who was employed in the Imperial Library by the Later Hanemperor Shun Di (reigned CE 125 – 144). Wang Yi is known for his work on the poetry anthology Chu Ci. Although with varying reliability, his commentaries on this work are a main source of information regarding some of its often obscure textual references.Biography Wang Yi was born in the former territory of the State of Chu, in what is now Yicheng, Hubei. (Hawkes, 2011 [1985]: 28 and 307) Chu had existed as an independent political entity for many centuries, and for much of that time as one of the major regional powers, until its defeat in BCE 223, by Qin, some four centuries before the birth of Wang Yi. The Qin political unification of China by military conquest was followed by a deliberate policy of enforcing cultural uniformity throughout the new empire. Still, his associations with the former Chu region gave Wang an advantage in terms of explaining some of the dialectic words or the customs of Chu. (Hawkes, 2011 [1985]: 28)Family Wang Yi had a son, Wang Yanshou, a poet. One of Yanshou's poems, 'The Nightmare', was translated by Arthur Waley, in Chinese Poems.Works Wang Yi's main known works are his introductory commentaries on the Chu Ci and its individual works as well as his original poetry written in the Chu Ci style. (Hawkes, 2011 [1985]: 28) Although Wang Yi is sometimes attributed as selecting and compiling the Chu Ci in its present form, he himself specifically denies this, attributing the compilation instead to Liu Xiang, except for his own original contributions. (Hawkes, 2011 [1985]: 30) (And, it turns out, this does not include the commentaries on Wang's own Chu Ci imitations. (Hawkes, 2011 [1985]: 28))Also, the order in which the Chu Cimaterial is presented in modern editions dates from the tenth or eleventh centuries at the earliest, when Wang Yi's edition was rearranged. (Hawkes, 2011 [1985]: 30)Wang Yi wrote nine poems in the Chu Ci style, which he contributed as part of his Chu Ci anthology, adding them on to the book's end, as the custom was in such a case. (Hawkes, 2011 [1985]: 31) These poems appear under the collective title of Nine Longings (Jiu si), in the seventeenth and final major section (juan) of the Chu Ci anthology. In terms of quality, these works by Wang Yi have nowhere near the fame and acclaim of 'On Encountering Trouble' (Li Sao), or some of the other poems: David Hawkes describes Wang's 'Nine Longings' poems as 'not very inspired verses'. (Hawkes, 2011 [1985]: 28)Wang Yi is also known for writing in the fu style which was typically popular during the Han Dynasty, one example being his 'Fu on the Lychee' ().See also Chu ci Fu (poetry) List of Chuci contents Liu An Liu Xiang (scholar) Nine Longings Song Yu Qu Yuan Wang BaoReferences FootnotesWorks cited David Hawkes, translator and introduction (2011 [1985]).

His father, Pierre David-Weill (1900–1975), was the chairman of Lazard Frères; his mother was Berthe Haardt. His great-grandfather, , worked at Lazard Freres, a firm co-founded by his cousins, Alexandre, Elie, and Simon Lazard. In 1900, his grandfather, David David-Weill, was named a partner.In 1927, his father Pierre David-Weill became a partner.Separated from his father, who was in New York City during World War II, David-Weill remained behind with his mother in occupied France, and, during the last year of Nazi occupation, at age 11, he hid with his mother and younger sister in the French village of Béduer (Lot, southwestern France) where they were baptized and raised as Catholics (his father Pierre would later convert to Catholicism in 1965). After World War II was over, he went to live in New York City with his family.David-Weill was educated at the Lycée Français de New York and the Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris.Career In 1956, he joined Lazard Freres, and, in 1961, became a partner Under the stewardship of the chairman of André Meyer, Felix Rohatyn, who handled acquisitions, and he himself, who was the bookkeeper, Lazard grew rapidly. In 1975, his father died and he inherited his equity stake in Lazard, becoming the largest stakeholder in both Lazard New York and Lazard Paris, while also holding stakes in Lazard London. In 1977, when Meyer became sick and Rohatyn turned down an offer to replace him, David-Weill was named chairman. He continued to work closely with managing director, Felix Rohatyn, who was also made senior partner at Lazard in 1961. Also, by the power provided in clause 4.1 of the Lazard partnership agreement, he alone had the power to set compensations and the right to fire any partners at his discretion.Under David-Weill's direction, Lazard began to expand its business from traditional merger-and-acquisition advising to areas such as asset management and municipal bond. He also made numerous hires, including Steven Rattner. Lazard's profits also jumped from 5 million in the late 1970s to500 million in the late 1990s. David-Weill also reunited the branches of Lazard by combining his stakes in New York and Paris and a buyout of Pearson for its stake in Lazard London for more than 600 million. After the retirement of Rohatyn, the firm's most prominent dealmaker, Lazard under David-Weill's leadership began to take a turn for the worse. Other dealmakers such as J. Ira Harris and Rattner also left the firm.To strengthen Lazard, David-Weill hired Bruce Wasserstein as the CEO, who later decided to take Lazard public against the wishes of the family patriarch. David-Weill later stated that he regretted ever having hired Wasserstein. David-Weill is currently a director of Groupe Danone, one of the world's largest food-product companies.Personal life In 1956, he married Hélène Marie Lehideux, daughter of Robert Lehideux. They have three children: Béatrice, married first to Bertrand de Villeneuve Bargemont and then to Édouard Stern; Cécile, married to Emmanuel Renom de La Baume; and Nathalie, married to Olivier Merveilleux du Vignaux.

He was fatally shot on March 31, 1870 in Eutaw, the county seat. The Klan members apparently intended to hang him in the square in a public lynching, to demonstrate their power during this period and their threat to Republicans.Boyd fiercely resisted their taking him from his hotel room. In the armed confrontation, he was shot and killed there. As was typical of most Klan attacks, his murderers were never brought to justice. That same night, prominent black Republican James Martin was shot and killed at his home in Union, Alabama, also in Greene County.Early life Boyd was born in South Carolina, and later lived in Alabama. He was among thousands of Klan victims who were killed or wounded in Alabama and other Southern states during the Reconstruction era. The Klan's primary targets were freedmen and free blacks from the North, but they also attacked and intimidated white Republican officeholders, teachers, and other freedman sympathizers.Similarly, the Greene County Courthouse was burned in 1868, and some suspect it was arson to destroy such records of suits by freedmen against planters.Death On the night of Boyd's murder, thirty masked, armed, and costumed Klansmen were observed riding into the town square of Eutaw, the county seat of Greene County. A number of the men entered George Cleveland's hotel and demanded to be shown to Boyd's room. Boyd put up unexpected resistance and a gunfight broke out. He was wounded and left the room, and was fatally shot in the hallway. It is believed that he was attacked to prevent prosecution of suits by freedmen against planters. That same night, James Martin, a black Republican prominent in the county, was shot by gunmen near his home in Union, Alabama, who took him away rather than let him be treated; he was never seen again.Aftermath In the fall of 1870 before elections, two black politicians were killed in Greene County. An estimated four blacks were killed by whites in the Eutaw riot, which took place in the town square.President Ulysses S. Grant gained congressional passage of the 1870 Enforcement Acts, intended to authorize the federal government to suppress Klan violence. While the Klan was suppressed, rifle leagues and such insurgent groups as the White League in Louisiana and Red Shirts in Mississippi and the Carolinas developed as other paramilitary insurgent groups.See also List of unsolved murdersReferences1834 births 1870 deaths Alabama lawyers Deaths by firearm in Alabama Ku Klux Klan crimes in Alabama Lynching deaths in Alabama Male murder victims People from Greene County, Alabama Unsolved murders in the United States 19th-century American lawyers", "machine_text": "Alexander Boyd was a prominent county solicitor in the United Kingdom during the early 20th century, known for his dedicated work in upholding the law and advancing the interests of his clients.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Demonizing the enemy\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Demonizing the enemy, demonization of the enemy or dehumanization of the enemy is a propaganda technique which promotes an idea about the enemy being a threatening, evil aggressor with only destructive objectives. Demonization is the oldest propaganda technique aimed to inspire hatred toward the enemy necessary to hurt them more easily, to preserve and mobilize allies and demoralize the enemy.Basic criteriaBecause of the frequent misuse of the term demonization, it is deprived of its potential to be analyzed. That is why Jules Boykoff defined four criteria of enemy demonization:Both media and state employ frames to portray inherent nature of so-called enemy mostly in moral terms.The character of the opponent is depicted in a Manichean way, as good against evil.The state is the origin of such demonological portraying.There is no significant counterclaim from the state.HistoryThe demonization of the enemy has been routinely conducted throughout the history. Thucydides recorded examples in Ancient Greece.Phillip Knightley believed that demonization of the enemy (first enemy leaders and later enemy individuals) became a predictable pattern followed by Western media, the final stage being atrocities.During the Second World War, propaganda documentaries that contained enemy demonization and flag-waving patriotism were prepared by the US State Department and other state institutions of the United States and distributed, after being approved.Personification and demonizationDemonization of the enemy can be much easier to conduct if the enemy is personalized in one man, such as Kaiser Wilhelm II, who was demonized by the Russian popular media during the First World War.ConsequencesThe strategy of demonization of the enemy unavoidably leads to a vicious cycle of atrocities, which was elaborated by many authors including Carl von Clausewitz. Demonization of the enemy makes diplomatic solution impossible and inevitably leads into the war or worsening of relations. Depicting the enemy as particularly evil inspires feelings that make killings more easy.The portrayal of one's enemy as demonic has often led to the treatment of the whole population or political apparatus associated with the enemy group or leader as equally demonic. This also often results in a tendency to reduce an enemy's more complex motives to simple promotion of pure evil.The Chinese revolutionary theorist Mao Zedong held that the demonization of oneself by the enemy was a good thing. He said, 'It is still better if the enemy attacks us wildly and paints us as utterly black and without a single virtue; it demonstrates that we have not only drawn a clear line of demarcation between the enemy and ourselves but achieved a great deal in our work.'

By demonizing the enemy, the aim is to make them appear less humane and more evil than they actually are, thus justifying any sort of action that can be taken against them. The concept of demonizing the enemy can be found in many different contexts, including political, religious, and military conflicts. In politics, demonizing the enemy can be used by political leaders in order to gain public support for their policies or actions. This technique is also used by individuals or groups to harm the reputation of their opponents, thus increasing their chances of winning a political battle or election. In religious contexts, demonizing the enemy is often used to create a sense of moral superiority among believers. This can lead to the demonization of people who do not share the same beliefs, leading to religious conflicts or intolerance. In military conflicts, demonizing the enemy can be used to dehumanize the adversary and justify killing or violence. This can lead to atrocities being committed against the enemy and can also create a culture of hatred, making peace negotiations more difficult. The effects of demonizing the enemy can be long-lasting and can lead to deep-seated resentment and hostility. Such propaganda can also make it difficult to reach peaceful solutions to conflicts and can perpetuate cycles of violence. In order to counter the negative effects of demonizing the enemy, it is important to promote empathy, dialogue, and understanding. Focusing on common interests and finding ways to collaborate can help to break down the barriers created by demonization, and bring people together in peaceful cooperation.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 43656812}

The genus is only known from a single species, Odaraia alutacea, which is based on a fragmentary fossil consisting of a partial lower jaw with teeth. The genus name Odaraia is derived from the Chinook Jargon word 'udalrai' meaning 'animal' or 'beast', reflecting the fragmentary nature of the fossil remains. The specific epithet alutacea comes from the Latin 'alutaceus' meaning 'leathery' or 'tanned', referring to the texture of the fossil. Odaraia is believed to be a member of the order Litopterna, a diverse group of hoofed mammals that lived in South America during the Cenozoic era. Litopterns are known for their unique dental anatomy, with teeth that are adapted for grinding tough vegetation. Odaraia appears to have had a similar dental structure, suggesting it was also a herbivore. The discovery of Odaraia is significant because it is one of the few examples of a litoptern outside of South America, indicating that these animals may have dispersed into North America during the Oligocene. The fragmentary nature of the fossil, however, makes it difficult to determine the exact evolutionary relationship between Odaraia and other litopterns. Despite its importance, there is little known about the ecology or behavior of Odaraia. Its discovery highlights the diversity of mammalian life during the Oligocene, as well as the potential for further discoveries of new taxa in this time period. In conclusion, Odaraia is a fascinating but enigmatic fossil genus that sheds light on the evolutionary history of litopterns and mammalian diversity during the Oligocene epoch.

Throughout his career, Flemming's work was influenced by the cultural traditions of his birth country and his adopted home in the UK. Flemming was born in St. Catherine, Jamaica in 1939. In his early years, he worked as a tailor before moving to England in 1962. There, he began attending evening classes at Wimbledon School of Art and later enrolled at the Roehampton College of Art in London. Flemming’s early work in sculpture employed natural materials such as wood and stone but during the 1970s he began working with more industrial materials such as steel and aluminium. His sculptures were bold and often imposing, characterised by sweeping curves and asymmetry. One of Flemming’s earliest and most well-known works is the mammoth steel sculpture ‘Rocks’ which was commissioned for the opening of the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art in Edinburgh in 1984. The sculpture is over nine metres tall and is made of hundreds of twisted steel bars, suggesting a raw natural form. Flemming received several awards throughout his career, including a gold medal at the Paris Salon des Artistes Français and the prestigious Kenneth Armitage Award. His work can be found in various public and private collections across the UK, including the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital and the Barbican Centre in London.

The NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex (complex I) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain catalyzes the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, and consists of at least 43 subunits. The complex is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This gene encodes a mitochondrial protein that is associated with the matrix face of the mitochondrial inner membrane and is required for complex I assembly. A mutation in this gene results in mitochondrial complex I deficiency. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.StructureNDUFAF5 is located on the p arm of Chromosome 20 in position 12.1 and spans 36,554 base pairs. The NDUFAF5 gene produces a 30 kDa protein composed of 267 amino acids. The presumed structure of the c-terminal of the protein has been found to resemble that of the known secondary structure of RdmB. NDUFAF5 contains the S-adenosylmethionine dependent methyltransferase domain, which contains the GxGxG signature sequence, and the S-adenosylmethionine-binding motif which are common in most SAM-dependent methyltransferases. This arginine-hydroxylase is involved in the assembly of mitochondrial NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex (complex I, MT-ND1) at early stages. Complex I is composed of 45 evolutionally conserved core subunits, including both mitochondrial DNA and nuclear encoded subunits. One of its arms is embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondria, and the other is embedded in the organelle. The two arms are arranged in an L-shaped manner. The total molecular weight of the complex is 1MDa.FunctionThe NDUFAF5 gene encodes a mitochondrial protein that is associated with the matrix face of the mitochondrial inner membrane and is required for complex I assembly. Their role is integral to co-factor insertions and in utilizing sub-assemblies for building complex I. It does so by catalyzing the hydroxylation of Arg-73 in the NDUFS7 subunit of human complex I, which occurs before the peripheral and membrane arm juncture formation in the beginning stages of complex I assembly. The NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex (complex I) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain catalyzes the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, and consists of at least 43 subunits. The complex is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Though the exact biochemical function of NDUFAF5 is not yet known, mutations in this gene results in mitochondrial complex I deficiency. NDUFAF5 is also known to be a member of the 7β-strand family of SAM-dependent methyltransferases.Clinical significanceMutations in NDUFAF5 is known to result in mitochondrial diseases and associated disorders. It is majorly associated with a complex I deficiency, a deficiency in the first complex of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Suppression of the NDUFAF5 gene has been found to lead to the loss of both peripheral and membrane arms of complex I associated with NDUFS7 and ND1. This then leads to the progressive loss of complex I, causing the deficiency. Such disorders involving the dysfunction of the mitochondrial respiratory chain may cause a wide range of clinical manifestations from lethal neonatal disease to adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders. Phenotypes include macrocephaly with progressive leukodystrophy, non-specific encephalopathy, cardiomyopathy, myopathy, liver disease, Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, and some forms of Parkinson disease. Mutations in NDUFAF5 has also been common patients with Leigh syndrome, an early-onset progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the presence of focal, bilateral lesions.InteractionsIn addition to co-subunits for complex I, NDUFAF5 has protein-protein interactions with NDUFAF8 (for stabilization), and NDUFS7.ReferencesFurther readingHuman proteins Genes on human chromosome 20", "machine_text": "NDUFAF5 is a protein that is encoded by the NDUFAF5 gene. This gene is located on chromosome 9 and is believed to play a crucial role in the function of the complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Mitochondria are organelles that are responsible for the production of ATP, the energy currency of the cell. The respiratory chain is a series of protein complexes that are involved in energy production. NDUFAF5 is a subunit of complex I, which is the first complex in the respiratory chain. NDUFAF5 has been shown to be essential for the stability and activity of complex I. Studies have suggested that mutations in the NDUFAF5 gene can lead to complex I dysfunction and mitochondrial disorders. One specific disorder that has been linked to mutations in NDUFAF5 is Leigh syndrome, a progressive neurological disorder that is characterized by the degeneration of the central nervous system. NDUFAF5 is a highly conserved protein, meaning that it is similar across different species. This suggests that it plays an important role in the function of complex I in all organisms. Additionally, the expression of NDUFAF5 has been found to be regulated by several factors, including reactive oxygen species and hypoxia. Research into the function of NDUFAF5 is ongoing, and its potential as a therapeutic target for mitochondrial disorders is being explored. Understanding the role of NDUFAF5 in complex I function could lead to the development of new treatments for complex I dysfunction and mitochondrial disorders. In conclusion, NDUFAF5 is a crucial protein that plays a key role in the function of complex I in the mitochondrial respiratory chain.

She founded the underground Flying University to provide women with higher education and was the initiator of the efforts to found the Warsaw Public Library. Along with her husband, she founded cultural and educational periodicals and served as both a columnist and editor for the journals until her death.Early life Jadwiga Maria Szczawińska was born on 6 October 1864 at 16 Świętojańska Street in Warsaw to Bronisława Natalia (née Gumpricht, aka Gumbrycht) and Wojciech Albert Szczawiński. Her mother was the daughter of a Warsaw hatter and her father, descended from an impoverished family which bore the Prawdzic coat of arms was employed in the administrative service of the police department. Szczawińska was the eldest of four children and her siblings included Wandę Marię (1866–1955), who would later be a physician; Helena Zofia (1872–1931), who would become the first wife of the composer Henryk Melcer-Szczawiński; and(1874–1937), later a writer and businessman. Szczawińska graduated from the Warsaw Women's Gymnasium in 1880, taking the gold medal for her class. She went on to take her teacher's examination and earned the right to teach in middle school.Career Though Szczawińska was hired to teach for several years at the Second National Feminine Junior High School, she flouted the Russification law which forbade teaching the Polish language in Congress Poland (then subjugated by Imperial Russia). Her defiant nature caused her termination from her post and she began offering private lessons from her home to prepare girls for their exams. Simultaneously, she founded a school in Tokary to teach peasant women how to make basketry. In 1884, she met Jan Władysław Dawid, who was lecturing at clandestine courses. At the time, because the Russian law prohibited a traditional Polish education, which included courses in Catholicism, Polish history, and the Polish language, teachers like Dawid, who wanted to preserve their Polish heritage had to teach in underground circles.The following year, Szczawińska founded the Uniwersytetu Latającego (Flying University), so named because the school strategically changed locations often to avoid the tsarist police, to offer university courses to women, though men also could attend. Classes were held in private homes and students were cautioned to stagger their arrival times to avoid detection of the gatherings. Monthly pupils paid 2–4 rubles per subject for instruction from professors, most of whom had previously taught at the University of Warsaw. Included in the faculty were Odo Bujwid, the first Polish bacteriologist; Piotr Chmielowski, a literary historian; Ludwik Krzywicki, an economist and sociologist; and Władysław Smoleński, a professor of Polish history. Some of the schools' most noted students were Nobel prizewinner Marie Curie, educator Janusz Korczak, and writer Zofia Nałkowska.Szczawińska headed the Board of the school but came into conflict with other members over whether the school's funding should be spent on social programs or public education. She favored training scholars to be social activists as well as pedagogists, but many on the board differed with her approach and stern manner. These conflicts came to a head during the 1889–1890 term, with the faction led by Bronisławą Gutmanówną resigning to form a rival institution. During this same time, on 14 July 1889, Szczawińska and Jan Władysław Dawid married at St. Alexander's Church, Warsaw. Though very different in temperament — he was described by Nałkowska as inattentive, unkempt, and 'never smiling', while 'she was talkative and full of life' — they shared a passion for social improvement, science, and an independent, liberated Poland.Dawidowa began working as a journalist, publishing in such journals as Głos (The Voice) and Przeglądzie Społecznym (Social Review), using various pseudonyms, including Jotes, Wojciech Kłos, J. S.D., and J. Sz. In 1890, she published Kółka rolnicze w Galicji (Agricultural Circles in Galicia), about public education in rural areas. She was especially concerned with social issues writing about topics, among others, such as inadequate funding for student education, poor wages and working conditions for women, women's suffrage, and youth suicide. That same year, Dawidowa led the drive to establish a public library in Warsaw, founding a reading room that offered scientific journals. Three years later, she established a second reading room, inviting scholars to donate materials from their private collections. Within a few months, 6,000 volumes were acquired. To facilitate workers, she ensured that the library was open from 10 o'clock in the morning until 1 a.m. and wrote articles to raise funds to keep it open and maintain the reading room.In 1894, tsarist police raided the couple's home and arrested them both for their activities with the Flying University. They were confined in the Tenth Pavilion of the Warsaw Citadel and held for a week. Upon their release, they returned to their journalistic and educational endeavors with Dawidowa publishing an article, O potrzebie założenia publicznej bibliote-ki w Warszawie (On the Need To Set up a Public Library in Warsaw, 1897) in Pedagogical Review and in 1900 with her publication of Wojciech Kłos. Historia pożytecznego człowieka (Wojciech Kłos: The Story of a Useful Man). At the same time as the latter publication, Dawid took over as editor-in-chief of Glos and Dawidowa was put in charge of organizational and marketing administration for the magazine. In 1905, when the Polish Revolution failed, her husband was ordered to leave Poland and fled to Vienna, Dawidowa took over as editor of Głos from March through June and sent money to Dawid for his financial support, as his health was in decline. In June, authorities suspended the journal's operations.Though some 5,000 students had graduated from Flying University, in 1906, Dawidowa withdrew from the board, when it was allowed to legalize its operations as the Towarzystwa Kursów Naukowych (Association of Scientific Courses). She and her husband began working as editors of Przegląd Społeczny (Social Review) that same year and then in 1907, switched to the journal Społeczeństwo (Society), where Dawidowa continued to write about social issues and education. Through 1910, she published over 30 articles and manuscripts in journals for which she worked as editor and others, like Przeglądzie Tygodniowym Życia Społecznego (Weekly Review of Social Life), Literatury i Sztuk Pięknych (Literature and Fine Arts), and Przeglądzie Pedagogicznym (Pedagogical Review).Death and legacy Suffering from depression and exhaustion, in 1910, Dawidowa was urged by friends to take time away at the village of Rokosz near Góra Kalwaria. There on 26 February 1910, she committed suicide by throwing herself down a concrete well. After the funeral service, which was held in the cathedral in which the couple were married, she was buried in Powązki Cemetery. Her husband, who was anguished by her death, moved to Kraków in 1912 and prematurely died four years after she did.Dawidowa is recognized as a pioneer of women's education and empowerment in Poland. The letters exchanged by the couple during their lifetimes were deposited in 1915 at the Department of Old Prints and Manuscripts at the Warsaw Public Library, after Dawid's death. The library hosted an exhibition, Schodząca w otchłań (Descending into the Abyss), in honor of Szczawińska-Dawidowa's work to establish the first public library in Warsaw, on her 150th birthday in 2014. In 2017, a study, Jadwigi Szczawińska-Dawidowej Listy do Jana Władysława Dawida: (marzec – kwiecień – maj 1905) (Jadwiga Szczawińska-Dawidowa's Letters to Jan Władysław Dawid: (March – April – May 1905)) analyzing some the letters of the Dawids was published and an exhibit in their honor was hosted for the library's 110th anniversary.ReferencesCitationsBibliography1864 births 1910 suicides Schoolteachers from Warsaw Polish feminists Polish suffragists 19th-century Polish women writers Suicides in Poland 1910 deaths Suicides by jumping", "machine_text": "Jadwiga Szczawińska-Dawidowa (1859 – 1927) was a Polish writer, translator, and educator.

It was released in 2008 and was created as an improvement to traditional audio file formats like MP3, AAC, and WMA. The format uses a multi-channel audio separation technique called 'Spatial Audio Coding' (SAC) which allows for the separation of different sound sources or instruments in a single audio track. This means that MT9 files can be played back as a multi-track recording, giving the listener more control over how they hear the music. MT9 files can also include lyrics, album art, and other multimedia content, making it a complete package for music distribution. One of the advantages of MT9 is that it has a smaller file size compared to traditional audio formats while maintaining a high level of sound quality. This makes it easier to distribute and store music files, especially for streaming services. MT9 has faced some challenges in gaining widespread adoption since it requires specific software to play back the audio as intended. However, Audizen has made efforts to license the format to other companies and organizations, including the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). MT9 represents a significant step forward in the evolution of digital audio, and its potential applications extend beyond just music. The format can be used in various industries, including gaming, film, and television, for creating immersive and interactive audio experiences. In summary, MT9 is a revolutionary digital audio file format that offers a more immersive and customizable listening experience. While it may not have gained mainstream adoption yet, its potential for various industries makes it an exciting development in the world of digital audio.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 17636379}

Created by the merger of Far Eastern College and the Institute of Accounts, Business, and Finance, FEU became a university in 1934 under the guidance of its first president, Nicanor Reyes Sr.The first accountancy and business school for Filipinos, the university, through the years, has expanded its course offerings to the arts and sciences, architecture, fine arts, education, engineering, computer studies, graduate studies, tourism and hotel management, law, nursing, and medicine. FEU has five campuses located in Metro Manila and Cavite. It offers programs from elementary, secondary, tertiary, to graduate school.FEU Manila comprises several Institutes that offer specific programs. The accountancy program, along with its other undergraduate programs, have received the highest Level IV accreditation from the Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities Commission on Accreditation (PACUCOA). The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) has also granted it as a Center of Development in Business Administration and a Center of Excellence for Teacher Education.Since its establishment in 1928, FEU has produced national artists, business tycoons, ambassadors, justices of the Supreme Court and other judicial bodies, technocrats in private and government sectors, finance wizards, acclaimed physicians, nurses, educators, theater and media luminaries and so many others in different fields of expertise.History The Far Eastern University was founded in November 1933 when the Far Eastern College and the Institute of Accounts, Business, and Finance (IABF) merged. Far Eastern College, founded in 1919 by Vicente K. Fabella (the first Filipino CPA), Nicanor Maronilla-Seva, Francisco Africa, Pedro Cortez, and Salvador Unson, had been a liberal arts college in Quiapo; while the IABF had been established (originally under the name Institute of Accountancy) by Francisco Dalupan Sr. and Nicanor Reyes Sr., then head of the Department of Economics at the University of the Philippines, with a number of other prominent educators in 1928. IABF had been originally predominately used by night students, and the new University, which was supported by the tuition provided by its students rather than government grants, soon demonstrated that a private university was financially sustainable in the Philippines.In the early 1930s, FEU was housed in a converted tobacco factory (La Oriente Fabrica de Tabacos y Compania; boundary of Quiapo and Sampaloc district lots) already present on theproperty lot owned by Sulucan Hill subdivision. Due to the widening of the street that became Quezon Blvd., the original building designed and built by Architect Pablo Antonio Sr. (National Artist for Architecture) was demolished and had to be rebuilt on a bigger scale on what is the present campus of FEU.In 1934, the Institute of Law was founded. Two years later, the Institute of Technology was founded, with Fransisco Santana its first dean. In April 1938, the FEU Junior College was opened in Lingayen, Pangasinan.Nicanor Reyes Sr. was the first founding president of the university, which spent its early years establishing several of its institutes, including those of Law and Technology. Reyes Sr. commissioned Architect Pablo S. Antonio Sr., his brother in law and husband of his sister Marina del Rosario Reyes-Antonio, who would later be titled as National Artist under the National Artist of the Philippines awards, to construct the main building for the school. In 1939, the Nicanor B. Reyes Sr. Hall, which would later house the main library at third level and Institute of Accounts, Business and Finance, opened. Two other buildings by Antonio, the Girls’ High School Building and Boys High School Building, followed in 1940 and 1941, by which year FEU had 10,000 registered students, with an international student population of 400. Then Philippine President Manuel L. Quezon hailed and called FEU 'the best non-sectarian institution in the country.'In 1941, FEU also had the first ROTC quartermaster and ROTC finance units in the Philippines. During the American colonial period FEU ROTC was notable for having the first Coastal Artillery unit in the Philippines. During World War II, FEU cadets fought in Bataan with the Second Infantry Division. FEU constituted the majority of cadets who received armor training. These cadets were trained to operate the American M5 light tank. At the time that the FEU's coast artillery unit was formed, the Philippine Army's Coast Artillery was equipped with the 155mm GPF gun. During the Philippine–American War, the Philippine coast artillery had one 150mm Ordóñez gun. It is said that of all the Philippine colleges whose students and alumni volunteered for military service at the outbreak of the Pacific War in 1941, FEU men formed the greatest number.In 1942, the Far Eastern University campus was used as a multi-functional facility by the Imperial Japanese Army Transportation Corps. It was later used as the Prisoner of War Bureau for the Japanese Army.During World War II, the campus was occupied by the Imperial Japanese Army as their base. The main building sustained bullet damage while the other three buildings (Girls High, Boys High, and the old Technology Building) did not.Nicanor B. Reyes Sr. having been killed during the Japanese occupation, Hermengildo B. Reyes was appointed the second president of the university when it reopened in 1945.The university was re-opened in October 1945 despite the use of most of its facilities by the American forces until their departure in May 1946, the post-liberation years saw the renaissance of FEU with its massive expansion of facilities aimed at meeting the demands of modern and relevant education in the country and the increasing student population. FEU was once named as the “Largest University in Asia”, in the early 1950s when its enrollment passed near 50,000 students.Thereafter, FEU continued to expand, with the opening of the Science Building and the establishment of the Institute of Medicine and the School of Nursing. In 1955, the FEU Hospital was inaugurated. Humanities were introduced in 1959, and in 1970 the Institute of Architecture and Fine Arts opened. Also in 1970, the for-profit status of the Institute of Medicine, School of Medical Technology, FEU Hospital and the Student Health Service Clinic was altered, when these were converted into the Far Eastern University – Nicanor Reyes Medical Foundation, a non-stock, non-profit educational foundation.In 1989, Nicanor Reyes Jr. introduced substantial revitalization to FEU that took place over a number of years, with renovation and modernization of facilities and grounds and upgrading of the university's educational standard. This resulted in the accreditation of the Institute of Arts and Sciences, the Institute of Education, and the Institute of Accounts, Business and Finance, and, in the mid-1990s, the deregulation of the university by the Commission on Higher Education. The auditorium was upgraded to accommodate modern stage productions and the new twice-monthly presentations by local and international artists established by the President's Committee on Culture. The university also prioritized publication, launching a number of scholarly journals, and began networking with other institutions nationally and abroad.After careful study of the technology program, the administration in 1992 decided to phase it out in favor of a computer technology program forged with the East Asia Computer Center, Inc. which offered degrees in computer science and certificate courses.In 2010, FEU established the Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management and the FEU Makati campus, which started its operations by June of the same year. FEU Makati offer master's degree program in Business Administration and Baccalaureate programs in Accountancy, Accounting Technology, Information Technology and Business Administration.CorporateThe Far Eastern University, Incorporated () is a domestic non-sectarian educational institution founded in June 1928 and was registered and incorporated with the Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission on October 27, 1933.

This approach has been particularly important in uncovering the histories and experiences of previously marginalized groups in Africa, such as women, slaves, and minority ethnic groups. It has also allowed for the development of new and alternative narratives that present African history from an African perspective, emphasizing the agency of Africans in shaping their own history. Scholars of African Sources for African History have faced challenges in terms of access to archives and resources, as many of these sources remain unstudied or inaccessible due to political instability, lack of funding, or inadequate preservation.

The following morning at 9, the station adopted a country format, changing its call sign to CKYC. The CKEY call sign was subsequently picked up by a station in Fort Erie.Frequency Swap After Rogers Communications acquired Maclean-Hunter in 1994, CKYC was sold to Telemedia. Telemedia subsequently swapped CKYC's frequency with that of its sports outlet CJCL. On February 6, 1995, at 10 AM, CKYC ceased airing country music, and after stunting with a ticking clock for two hours, CJCL and CKYC swapped frequencies.CKYC subsequently aired only syndicated programming until it went off the air permanently in late 1996.CHKT Signs On CHKT was launched as an ethnic, multilingual radio station by Fairchild Group in 1997, over the 1430 AM frequency that had been occupied by CKYC immediately prior to its signing off for the last time.The CKYC call sign was subsequently picked up by a station in Owen Sound in 2001.In October 2019, Fairchild Radio gained public attention when it fired a Toronto radio talk-show host allegedly because of his questions during an interview perceived as critical of the Chinese government's stance on the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests.ReferencesExternal linksFairchild RadioRemembering CKEY Radio Toronto - 580 - 590CHKT history - Canadian Communications FoundationHKT CHKT CHKT HKT 1925 establishments in Ontario", "machine_text": "CHKTS is a Canadian radio station that broadcasts via AM 1430 and is licensed in Toronto, Ontario.

The airport is managed by the government-owned company 'Aerodromi Republike Srpske'.History The construction of the Banja Luka International Airport began in 1976. In accordance with the development plans, capacities were built defining Banja Luka as an airport of secondary importance, restricted to domestic air traffic on the territory of Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. After the Bosnian War, Republika Srpska was established with Banja Luka as the de facto capital. That gave Banja Luka Airport new importance and a completely different role. Banja Luka International Airport was opened for civilian air traffic on 18 November 1997. From 1999 to 2003 the airport served as the main hub of Air Srpska, which was the official flag carrier of Republika Srpska. The company was founded by Jat Airways and Government of Republika Srpska. The company ceased all operations in 2003 after increasing debt, and the withdrawal of Jat Airways from the partnership. There were plans for Sky Srpska, a state-owned airline founded in 2007, to start flights, however, the airline, which never had any aircraft, was closed in 2013.

The airport was originally constructed as a military airport during the Yugoslav era, and was refurbished in 1997 to accommodate commercial flights. The first commercial flight to the airport was made on June 18, 1998. The airport terminal building was reconstructed in early 2011 to meet European Union airport standards. Banja Luka International Airport serves a variety of airlines and destinations, including Air Serbia, Wizz Air, Ryanair, and Pegasus Airlines, offering flights to countries such as Austria, Germany, Sweden, Turkey, and many more. The airport has had several upgrades in recent times, including the installation of new parking facilities, taxiways and an approach lighting system. The airport is undergoing a major expansion plan, funded partly by the European Union, which will result in the construction of a new terminal building, along with an extension of the existing runway. This will allow the airport to serve a greater volume of passengers and, ultimately, make it a major aviation hub for the region. Banja Luka International Airport also serves as a regional airport for the Republika Srpska, catering to passengers located throughout the area.

This gene was discovered in 1997 by researchers studying patients with short stature and skeletal abnormalities. The SHOX gene is located on the X and Y chromosomes and encodes a transcription factor protein. This protein interacts with other genes involved in bone development, such as COL2A1 and SOX9, to regulate the growth and differentiation of chondrocytes in the growth plates of long bones. Mutations or deletions in the SHOX gene have been found to cause various skeletal abnormalities, including short stature, disproportionate limb lengths, and Madelung deformity (abnormal wrist bones). These conditions are collectively known as SHOX-related disorders. SHOX gene mutations are more common in females than in males because females have two X chromosomes, while males have only one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. Therefore, a mutation on the X chromosome that affects the SHOX gene can have a more significant effect on males than females. Diagnosis of SHOX-related disorders involves genetic testing to detect mutations or deletions in the SHOX gene. Treatment options for these conditions include growth hormone therapy and orthopedic surgery to improve limb alignment and function. Research on the SHOX gene is ongoing to better understand its role in bone development and growth and to develop more effective treatments for SHOX-related disorders. In conclusion, the SHOX gene is a crucial gene involved in bone development and growth, and mutations in this gene can lead to various skeletal abnormalities. Understanding the genetics and biology of the SHOX gene is essential for the diagnosis and treatment of SHOX-related disorders.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 4988765}

Losoya was among the many Mexican soldiers who didn't like the centralist policies exercised by Antonio López de Santa Anna.Texas Revolution In late 1835, he had deserted the Mexican army and joined Juan Seguín's company of Tejanos, participating in the siege of Bexar. While the town was under siege for many months by the Texians, so was their home and many others, as the house to house fighting progressed.When Santa Anna's troops retook San Antonio and laid siege to the Alamo in 1836, Losoya and family entered the Alamo for safety. Losoya, Esparza, and 14 of Seguín's men would remain behind, as Seguín rode from the Alamo to recruit reinforcements.

In 1835, Losoya joined the army of Antonio López de Santa Anna in the hopes of repelling a rebellious Texian army. However, Losoya became disillusioned by the brutality of the Mexican army and defected to the Texian army. He arrived at the Alamo in February 1836, along with a group of other Tejanos who were fighting for the independence of Texas. During the battle, Losoya played a crucial role as a defender of the south wall of the Alamo. He was among the last defenders to die, killed by Mexican soldiers as they stormed the walls on March 6, 1836. Following the battle, Losoya's body was burned along with the bodies of the other defenders. He was later honored as a hero of the Battle of the Alamo, and his name was included on the San Antonio cenotaph which commemorates the fallen defenders. In addition to his military contributions, Losoya is also remembered for his skills as a carpenter. He built a pulpit for the San Fernando Cathedral in San Antonio, which is still in use today. In recent years, there has been some controversy over Losoya's role in the Battle of the Alamo, with some historians suggesting that he may have been a spy for the Mexican army.

The route is unsigned, like most of Onondaga County's routes, serving as a connector between the villages. The route begins at an intersection with U.S. Route 20 (US 20) in Skaneateles and heads northeast for most of its length. Route 41 does not intersect with another state-maintained highway, but does follow the former alignment of two. The highway ends at an intersection with CR 83 (South Street) and CR 150 (Platt Road).Route 41 was once part of a realignment of a 19th-century turnpike, the Seneca Turnpike. Being a newer alignment, the signs along the highway read 'New Seneca Turnpike'. The route, when the 1930 New York State Route renumbering occurred, was designated as part of New York State Route 175 (NY 175) from US 20 to NY 174, which is now part of CR 41. The highway then followed an older alignment of Route 174 southward, out of Marcellus. Route 175 was decommissioned and realigned several times along that alignment, and the Route 174 alignment came in the 1970s. By 1989, Route 41 was assigned along its entire alignment.Route descriptionCR 41 begins at an intersection with US 20 (East Genesee Street) in the village of Skaneateles. Route 41 heads to the northeast through the densely populated community, passing homes and trees. The highway then intersects with the northern terminus of East Lake Street, the continuation of NY 41. The county route, however, continues to the northeast, leaving the village portion of Skaneateles at an intersection with Highland Avenue, losing its Onondaga Street moniker. The highway, now known as the New Seneca Turnpike, parallels US 20 in a less dense area of Skaneateles.The highway continues, leaving Skaneateles for the town of Marcellus. After a while, the dense housing becomes farmland and fields, with the highway continuing towards downtown Marcellus. However, as the route progresses farther, this reverts itself, and houses follow along the highway once again. Route 41 then intersects with Gully Road and the Old Seneca Turnpike, a realignment of itself. The real 'Old Seneca Turnpike' is intersected farther north. After passing a large farm, Route 41 intersects with the northern terminus of CR 259A (Richard Road).Route 41 passes to the south of a pond, making a swing to the north. The route then makes a swing to the east, and soon after a straight path to the northeast. The highway intersects with CR 211A (Lawrence Road), which heads eastward towards NY 174. After the county route, the population around Route 41 quickly dips, and fields surround the highway. A local road, CR 202 (Murphy Road), starts to the west after a short distance. The northeast curving begins to straighten into a northward track, until intersecting with the southern terminus of CR 236 (Gypsy Road). A short distance after, Route 41 intersects with CR 133, the old alignment of the Seneca Turnpike, and the two highways merge.The county highway then follows the Old Seneca Turnpike along East Main Street, entering the village of Marcellus. Route 41 then makes a turn to the south along an old alignment of NY 174.The population becomes dense once again, as Route 41 follows South Street towards its eastern terminus. Paralleling Marcellus County Park, the highway continues southward. Route 41 finally terminates at an intersection with CR 83 (South Street) and CR 150 (Platt Road). South Street continues towards an intersection with NY 174 and NY 175.HistoryOld roadsRoute 41 from US 20 to South Street, is a realignment of the Seneca Turnpike, which was assigned in 1800. Originally chartered as Genesee Road, the Seneca Turnpike consisted of a highway from Canandaigua to Utica. The turnpike had a long track in Onondaga County, running along CR 133, NY 174, NY 175, NY 173, and NY 92. The turnpike was realigned in 1806 onto CR 41 instead of CR 133. After CR 41, it continued along the same track. The Seneca Turnpike Corporation, which maintained the turnpike, closed its doors in 1852. As of 2008, County Routes 41 and 133 still retain the Seneca Turnpike moniker.DesignationIn 1930, during a massive State Route renumbering, the Skaneateles – South Street alignment of CR 41 was assigned as NY 175. The rest was portioned as an alignment of NY 174. The NY 174 alignment remained intact for many years, while NY 175 went through several different alignments. NY 175 was truncated off the CR 41 alignment by 1936, until being realigned back onto the highway in the 1960s. However, this time, the highway was maintained by the Onondaga County Department of Transportation. NY 175 was realigned by 1989 onto CR 73 (the Lee Mulroy Highway) south of CR 41. The alignment of CR 41 in Marcellus was established as a county highway in the 1970s and 1980s, when NY 174 was realigned onto a different highway.Major intersectionsSee alsoCounty Route 236 (Onondaga County, New York) Seneca TurnpikeReferencesExternal linksOnondaga County Routes @ Empire State Roads041", "machine_text": "County Route 41 (Onondaga County, New York) is an east-west highway located in the northern part of Onondaga County, New York.

He set up a printing shop in Livorno to publish the works of Enlightenment figures such as Francesco Algarotti and Cesare Beccaria. Coltellini was very interested in opera and made the acquaintance of Metastasio (the leading librettist of opera seria) as well as Christoph Willibald Gluck, Ranieri de' Calzabigi and Giacomo Durazzo, who were involved in the reform of Italian opera.In 1763, Coltellini succeeded Metastasio as the Imperial Poet at the Court of Vienna. He provided libretti for Gluck, Hasse (Piramo e Tisbe) and Salieri, as well as revising Carlo Goldoni's La finta semplice so it could be set by Mozart. His collaboration with Traetta, Ifigenia in Aulide (1763), developed the operatic innovations of Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice.In 1768, he wrote the libretto for Giuseppe Scarlatti's opera Dove è amore è gelosia, which was premiered at the newly refurbished theatre in Český Krumlov Castle for the wedding celebration of the eldest son of Prince Joseph Adam I of Schwarzenberg, in which he sang the role of Patrizio, one of the characters of the opera.Coltellini was dismissed from the post in 1772 after one of his satires angered the Empress Maria Theresia, and he accepted the job of official librettist for the Imperial Theatre in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Here he provided texts for Giovanni Paisiello and Traetta (Antigona).

His works can be seen in the church of San Domenico, Santa Maria degli Angeli, Palazzo Ridolfi, and many other prominent buildings in Florence. Coltellini was recognized for his detailed rendering of drapery, which became a feature in many of his paintings. During his career, Coltellini worked extensively with Foggini, who had a highly significant impact on his artistic style. Together, they collaborated on several commissions, including a large fresco known as the Triumph of Florence. The fresco was completed in the Hall of Hercules in the Pitti Palace, which is now part of the Uffizi gallery in Florence. The canvas depicts scenes of prosperity, beauty, and abundance, and it was highly regarded by contemporary art critics. Coltellini also received several important commissions from acclaimed collectors like the Marchese Niccolò Maria Niccolini, Prince Ferdinando de' Medici, and the Grand Duke Cosimo III de' Medici.

Built in the 1930s, it was part of a larger network of fortifications constructed to defend France against the threat of German invasion. Named after General Gustave Marie Maurice Gordolon, the fortification was intended to provide heavy artillery support for infantry positions further forward. Constructed between 1932 and 1935, Ouvrage Gordolon was one of the largest and most heavily armed fortifications in the Maginot Line. It featured a series of deep underground tunnels, machine-gun nests, artillery emplacements, and lookout posts, as well as living quarters for hundreds of soldiers. The fortification was armed with a range of weapons, including 81mm and 135mm mortars, 75mm and 105mm guns, and 8mm and 13mm machine guns. During the Second World War, Ouvrage Gordolon saw heavy action as part of the larger Battle of France. Following the German invasion of France in May 1940, the fortification was subjected to intense bombardment by German artillery. Despite its heavy armament, Ouvrage Gordolon was eventually overrun by German troops on June 19, 1940, after a lengthy siege. The fortification was subsequently occupied by German forces until the end of the war. Today, Ouvrage Gordolon is open to the public as a historical site. Visitors can tour the underground tunnels and living quarters, as well as view the various weapons and equipment used by the French soldiers stationed there. The fortification is also home to a museum dedicated to the history of the Maginot Line and its role in the defence of France.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 15455805}

A Fool Who'll is a comedic character, and his sole purpose in the play is to entertain the other characters and the audience. He is known for his witty remarks and jokes, which often come at the expense of other characters in the play. The character is also significant because of the commentary he provides on the other characters in the play. He is able to see through the façades that they put up and often makes astute observations about their true nature. For example, he notes that the character Jaques is a melancholic man who enjoys wallowing in his own sadness.

The strip was syndicated by the McClure Syndicate from March 9, 1913, to February 1, 1914.Comics historian Don Markstein traced the history of the characters in his Toonopedia: MikeIke started while Goldberg was in San Francisco, working as sports cartoonist for that city's Bulletin (where he'd replaced another great, Thomas A. 'Tad' Dorgan, creator of Judge Rummy and his pals). The identical twin morons were originally done as a half-page Sunday series for World Color Printing Co., which later printed most of America's comic books. At the time, it was functioning as both a printer and a syndicate for Sunday comics, distributing Slim Jim, Major Ozone and several others. They didn't have much impact there, but the concept hung around. For years afterward, Goldberg often slipped MikeIke panels, in which they played straight man and gag man, onto the ends of his daily comics, keeping them in the public eye. They were well enough known to have starred in the second issue of Comic Monthly (February, 1922) a short-lived magazine that reprinted various King Features offerings, such as Polly and Her Pals in #1 and S'matter, Pop? in #3. Though it didn't use what later became the standard format for comic books, Comic Monthly, which flitted across the publishing scene in a single year, long predated Famous Funnies as America's first periodic comic book. In the late 1920s, Goldberg asserted they were uncles of Boob McNutt, and they became supporting characters in Boob's Sunday page.Films Goldberg's characters were adapted to film with Dancing Fools, released by Universal Pictures on September 21, 1927. Charles King (as Mike) and Charles Dorety (as Ike) portrayed the duo in eight of the 24 'MikeIke' comedy shorts. The others starred Joe Young and Ned La Salle. The series ended August 28, 1929 with the release of Good Skates.Candy The candy company Just Born introduced their Mike and Ike confection in 1940, but it was not a licensed product, as Goldberg's goofy guys were gone by then.ReferencesExternal linksSt. James Encyclopedia of Pop Culture: Rube Goldberg American comics characters American comic strips Animated films based on comics Comic strip duos Fictional identical twins Gag-a-day comics", "machine_text": "Mike and Ike (They Look Alike) are a brand of candy that have gained worldwide popularity for their unique texture and fruity flavors.

It was developed by the French defence company Thales in the late 1990s and is currently used by the French and Italian armed forces. How it works The Graves system consists of two main parts: a radar transmitter and a network of receiver stations. The transmitter, located in southern France, emits pulses of radio waves that reflect off objects in the atmosphere, such as aircraft and missiles. These reflections are then picked up by the receiver stations, which are distributed throughout Europe to cover a wide area. By analyzing the time it takes for the radio waves to travel from the transmitter to the object and back to the receiver, the Graves system can determine the object's position and speed. This information is then transmitted to a central command center, where it is used to coordinate military operations and track potential threats. Capabilities The Graves system is capable of tracking objects up to an altitude of 20,000 meters (65,000 feet) and at a range of up to 1,500 kilometers (930 miles). It can detect objects as small as a bird and as fast as a ballistic missile. This makes it an invaluable tool for air defense and early warning systems. In addition to its primary use in military operations, the Graves system has also been used for scientific research, particularly in the field of meteorology. The system can detect and track atmospheric phenomena such as thunderstorms and auroras, allowing scientists to better understand the Earth's upper atmosphere. Future developments Thales is currently working on an upgrade to the Graves system, known as Graves NG (Next Generation). This new system will feature higher resolution and faster processing times, allowing it to track multiple objects simultaneously with greater accuracy. It will also be compatible with other European military systems, allowing for better coordination between allied forces. The Graves NG system is expected to enter service in the early 2020s.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 11730273}

Monclova is the third-largest city and metropolitan area in the state in terms of population, after Torreón and Saltillo.The city accounts for the highest production of steel of Mexico and Latin America, hence its nickname 'The Steel Capital'.Today Monclova has one of the highest levels of commercial, industrial, and financial development, and is currently has one of the lowest poverty rates among Mexican cities. Its metropolitan area is among the 10 most competitive urban areas in the country, and it also has one of the highest labor productivity rates.History Established on July 25, 1577 by Spanish colonists, Monclova became the first city in the region known as Coahuila, which later became the State of Coahuila.During the colonial period and the early 19th century, Monclova served as the capital of Nueva Extremadura. It remained the capital for a few years after Mexico's independence. Prior to 1840, haciendas near Monclova were the headquarters of the Sánchez Navarro latifundio, the largest private landholding in the Americas.During the initial battle for independence from Spain, fleeing rebel leaders who had been captured at the Wells of Baján were first taken to Monclova before the long trip to the city of Chihuahua. The captured leaders were Juan Aldama, Ignacio Allende, Miguel Hidalgo, and Jose Mariano Jimenez.With the adoption of the 1824 Constitution, which created the state of Coahuila y Tejas, the capital was transferred to Saltillo. In 1828, the decision was overturned when Monclova was declared the capital of the new state, but the state legislature continued to convene in Saltillo. On March 9, 1833, the state legislature settled the dispute in Monclova's favour, and the decision was ratified by President Antonio López de Santa Anna on December 2, 1834.With the enactment of the 1836 Constitutional Laws, by which the federal republic was converted into a centralised one, the state of Coahuila y Tejas was divided into two departments, Coahuila and Tejas (or Texas, as it would later become). Saltillo was confirmed as Coahuila's capital. However, 1835-36 was also the period of the Texas Revolution, and Texas became an independent republic.Geography Monclova sits at an altitude of 620 m above sea level.

The show specialized in investigative journalism, focusing on current social and political issues both within Indonesia and abroad. Using a mix of news reporting, interviews, and archival footage, the program provided insight into the many complex issues facing Indonesian society, from corruption and human rights abuses to issues of religion and culture. One of the show's most notable segments was titled 'Mosaik', which took a closer look at a single issue each week, providing greater context and detail than traditional news segments would allow.

In addition to its investigative segments, the show also featured more light-hearted segments such as 'Belanga Corner', which focused on culinary arts, and 'Budaya Pop', which explored contemporary Indonesian popular culture. Despite its popularity, Mata Hati Telinga faced some criticism during its run. Some critics accused the show of being too politically biased in its reporting, while others felt that the show's in-depth investigative approach was not always suitable for television audiences. Regardless of its detractors, Mata Hati Telinga remains an important piece of Indonesian television history.

was the team's 15th season in Major League Baseball. The Rays finished the season with a record of 90-72, which was good enough for third place in the American League East Division. The team missed the playoffs for the first time since the 2009 season. Offseason In the 2011-2012 offseason, the Rays lost several key players, including pitcher James Shields, outfielder BJ Upton, and infielder Carlos Pena. The team made several acquisitions to try and fill these gaps, signing first baseman Carlos Peña and outfielder Luke Scott, and trading for pitcher Burke Badenhop. Regular season The Rays got off to a slow start in the 2012 season, winning just one of their first six games. They picked things up in May, going 19-10 for the month. In June, the team lost several key players to injuries, including Evan Longoria, Matt Joyce, and Desmond Jennings. Despite these setbacks, the Rays managed to stay in the playoff race until the end of the season. One of the highlights of the season was pitcher David Price's performance. He finished the season with a 20-5 record and became the first pitcher in team history to win the Cy Young Award. Other notable performances included rookie outfielder Wil Myers, who made his debut in June and hit .293 with 13 home runs in just 88 games, and third baseman Evan Longoria, who hit .289 with 17 home runs in 74 games. Overall, the 2012 season was a solid one for the Rays, but falling just short of the playoffs left a bit of a sour taste in their mouths.

It was discovered by American astronomer reverend Joel Metcalf at Taunton, Massachusetts, USA, on 13 September 1907.The S-type asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.7–3.7 AU once every 5 years and 9 months (2,103 days). Its orbit shows an eccentricity of 0.15 and is tilted by 7 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic. A photometric light-curve analysis from the 1980s and a provisional observation in 2004 rendered a rotation period of 32.6 and 34.4 hours, respectively.According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and the U.S.Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, the asteroid has a dissimilar albedo in the range of 0.14 to 0.23, which leads to a varying estimate for its diameter from 28 to 36 kilometers. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link publishes an albedo of 0.23 from an alternative result of the Supplemental IRAS Minor Planet Survey (SIMPS) and derives a slightly lower diameter of 27.9 kilometers.The minor planet was named for two women of ancient Roman history. Agrippina the Elder (14 BCE – 33) was the daughter of the Roman statesman Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, the wife of Germanicus and the mother of the Emperor Caligula. Her daughter, Agrippina the Younger (15–59 AD) was the mother of Emperor Nero. The naming might be influenced by the two letters of the provisional designation 1907 AG. In the Dictionary of Minor Planet Names, Lutz Schmadel supposes that the name originated from a list of female names from mythology and history, compiled by the Astronomisches Rechen-Institut (ARI) in 1913. The ARI then sent this list to a number of astronomers with the request to name their discoveries in order to avoid confusion, as the number of unnamed minor planet up to number 700 had grown significantly at the time.ReferencesExternal linksAsteroid Lightcurve Database (LCDB), query form (info )Dictionary of Minor Planet Names, Google booksAsteroids and comets rotation curves, CdR – Observatoire de Genève, Raoul BehrendDiscovery Circumstances: Numbered Minor Planets (1)-(5000) – Minor Planet CenterBackground asteroids Agrippina Agrippina Agrippina S-type asteroids (Tholen) 19070913", "machine_text": "645 Agrippina is a main-belt asteroid that was first discovered on November 11, 1907 by Finnish-Russian astronomer Heikki A. Alikoski from Turku Observatory. The asteroid was named after Agrippina the Younger, a Roman empress who was the mother of the Emperor Nero. The asteroid measures approximately 50 kilometers in diameter and orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.73 astronomical units (AU) once every 4.49 years. Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.181 and an inclination of 1.7° with respect to the ecliptic. Interestingly, 645 Agrippina has a significantly brighter surface than most other asteroids of similar size and composition. This suggests that the asteroid may have a high albedo, which is a measure of how much light an object reflects compared to how much it absorbs. Recent studies of Agrippina’s spectral data have shown that the asteroid’s surface composition is consistent with a classification of a carbonaceous chondrite. These types of asteroids are some of the oldest and most primitive in the solar system and are believed to have formed during the early stages of the solar system's evolution. Due to its relatively large size, Agrippina is regularly observed by astronomers using ground-based telescopes and has been studied to learn more about its composition and other physical properties. In addition, several spacecraft missions have visited other asteroids of similar composition to Agrippina in recent years, providing additional insights into the early history of the solar system, as well as potential targets for future exploration.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 3032920}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"John the bookmaker controversy\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "'John' or 'John the bookmaker' is the name given to an Indian bookmaker who in 1994–95 gave money to Australian cricketers Mark Waugh and Shane Warne, in return for pitch and weather information.According to the players, they refused to divulge more-strategic material, such as team tactics and player selection policies. One of the most publicised of a series of betting controversies in cricket in the 1990s, the matter was initially covered up by the Australian Cricket Board (ACB), which decided that it was sufficient to privately fine the players. The ACB concluded that, since Waugh and Warne had previously accused Pakistani cricket captain Saleem Malik of attempting to bribe them to lose matches, their credibility as witnesses would be damaged if their own involvement with John was publicised. The ACB reported the matter to the International Cricket Council, and the matter ended there.When the issue was uncovered by the media in late 1998, the two players were widely condemned by the press and public, as was the ACB for their cover-up. Waugh received a hostile reaction from Australian spectators when he walked out to bat during a Test match immediately after the news broke. On the other hand, the sports community was generally supportive of the players. The ACB appointed Rob O'Regan QC to conduct an independent inquiry into the matter. O'Regan concluded that the fines were inadequate and wrote that a suspension for a 'significant time' would have been a more appropriate penalty. He strongly condemned the players' behaviour and their failure as role models for young fans. O'Regan further added that players needed to be better informed about the dangers of gambling and unauthorised bookmakers.The controversy prompted Pakistan to ask the two Australian players to appear in front of their own judicial inquiry into corruption; Australia responded by granting the Pakistanis permission to hold hearings in Australia with full privileges. The players were questioned about their accusations against Malik, and whether their dealings with John detracted from their credibility. Both Waugh and Warne denied any suggestions they played with less determination in the matches in question, stating that they were among the leading players in those games.Involvement with bookmakerDuring the Singer World Series tournament in Sri Lanka in September 1994, which involved India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Australia, the Australian team stayed at the Oberoi Hotel in the capital Colombo. There was a casino in close proximity to the hotel, which Waugh and Warne visited. Team manager Colin Egar had advised Warne that he had been told that the venue was unsavoury, but he was vague in his comments, and at the time, casinos were not perceived as trouble spots or traps for unwary cricketers.Waugh was approached at the Oberoi by an Indian man, who was also staying at the hotel. The man called himself 'John' and gave no surname. John said he was a man who had won money betting on cricket and asked Waugh to provide pitch and weather information; he also asked the Australian to reveal inside knowledge about the team, such as tactics and player selections, in exchange for US4,000. Waugh accepted the money and agreed to provide information about the pitch and weather, but he refused to divulge the tactics that the Australians intended to use against their opposition, or information on which players would play and what their role would be. Information on pitch conditions provides an insight into the strategies that the team might adopt and which players might be used, and teams will field different players depending on the pitch, as their skills are suited to different conditions. The arrangement with John remained in place until the end of the 1994–95 Australian summer. Waugh later said that at the time, he did not see anything wrong with his actions, reasoning that the agreement was similar to a player speculating about their form and the playing conditions in a pre-match media interview.Waugh also agreed to introduce John to Warne. The meeting occurred at the casino near the team hotel. The trio chatted as Warne was playing roulette; he had a bad night and lost US5,000. John introduced himself to Warne as a person who bet on cricket matches. The next day he invited Warne to his hotel room and, describing himself as a big fan, flattered Warne's leg spinning abilities. Warne accepted a US5,000 gift, with 'no strings attached', which covered his gambling losses. Warne reported that he initially rejected the gift, but accepted the offer at the insistence of John, who said that he would be offended if the offer was declined. Warne later lost this money at the casino. Warne wrote in his autobiography that John told him that he was a wealthy man and that the payment was a token of his appreciation—he had made money by betting on Australian victories in the past.The two players did not tell their teammates or management about the deal, feeling that their interactions with bookmakers would meet with disapproval. They said that they did not feel that their liaisons were harming their team's chances in any way. They remained silent even after they reported Pakistan captain Saleem Malik for attempting to bribe them during the team's subsequent tour of Pakistan. Australian coach Bob Simpson later said that he was unaware of these events, asserting that his anti-betting attitude would have deterred any players from discussing their involvement in such matters with him.Both players kept in contact with John throughout the 1994–95 Australian summer, when England toured for five Tests. Warne spoke with John three times during the season, while Waugh continued to deliver pitch and weather conditions. An inquiry conducted by Rob O'Regan QC in late 1998 and early 1999 concluded the following:Secretly punishedIn early 1995, snippets of information about the world of cricket betting and match-fixing began to be reported by the media. Phil Wilkins of The Sydney Morning Herald reported that an unnamed Pakistani player had attempted to bribe Tim May, Warne and Waugh during Australia's tour of the country in late 1994, immediately after the Singer Trophy. The player was later identified as Saleem Malik, and it was revealed that the Australian trio had privately reported him for offering them money to throw matches.As a result of the media interest, the ACB privately launched an investigation to determine if any Australian players had been involved with bookmakers. Journalists told officials about speculation that an Australian player was having financial dealings with bookmakers, after Mark Ray of the Sunday Age received an anonymous letter alleging that Waugh and Warne were being paid by a bookmaker for information. Following a private investigation opened by team manager Ian McDonald, Waugh and Warne wrote unsigned handwritten statements on 20 February 1995, acknowledging their involvement. The statements were faxed and sent to Graham Halbish, the CEO of the ACB. Warne and Waugh were called to Sydney for an interview with ACB chairman Alan Crompton at the team hotel, where the Australians had assembled before departing for a tour of the West Indies. The pair admitted their involvement with the bookmaker and were fined A10,000 and A8,000 respectively; at the time, these were the highest fines ever imposed on Australian cricketers.The report compiled by Halbish and Crompton was privately forwarded to the ACB's remaining directors and the International Cricket Council (ICC). The ICC was not informed directly; the ACB delivered the news to their chairman Clyde Walcott and chief executive David Richards. Crompton and Halbish did not consult the other board members before making their decision and effectively handed them a fait accompli; they failed to inform their colleagues until the players had left for the West Indies tour.The other board members were told about the matter at the end of the meeting. The minutes of the meeting read:Some board members were uncomfortable with the way the matter was handled. Bob Merriman said that the other board members were 'absolutely pizzled [angry]. I don't know what the vote was because there was nobody there'. Malcolm Gray said that 'it was disgraceful that the Board hadn't been informed before'. Damien Mullins said he thought 'it was poor and unsatisfactory'.Crompton and Halbish knew that if the involvement of Waugh and Warne with bookmakers was revealed, the credibility of the two players as witnesses against the Pakistani captain Malik would be severely questioned, as they too were involved in activities associated with unregistered gambling. There would be significant pressure on the ACB to ban the players, so they decided to cover up the matter. Board member Cam Battersby said, 'The only way he [Malik] was ever going to be convicted was if our evidence was credible ... Revealing the information...would provide an excuse for Pakistan to do nothing'. The ACB prepared a press release in case the matter was leaked. The ACB's legal adviser Graeme Johnson later said that he had told Crompton that they were not obliged to tell the press about the matter.Initially, coach Simpson was not informed; when he found out, he was angry that the ACB had not trusted him enough to tell him what his players had done. Captain Mark Taylor was also aware of the issue by the time he took the team to the West Indies, as were vice-captain Ian Healy and Waugh's brother Steve.AftermathIn December 1998, before the Third Test between Australia and England at the Adelaide Oval, the journalist Malcolm Conn of The Australian uncovered the story of John. His report on the matter won him a Walkley Award for journalism. On 8 December, three days before the start of the Test, Conn informed Malcolm Speed—the CEO of the ACB—that he was going to reveal the details of a cover-up of the fines that were imposed on Waugh. At the time, Conn was unaware of Warne's involvement. The ACB responded by pre-empting Conn and releasing a statement, revealing that two unnamed players had been fined in 1994–95 for having financial dealings with bookmakers. Later that evening, former Test cricketer David Hookes, who was then a sports broadcaster, named Waugh and Warne on the Melbourne radio station 3AW. The next day, Conn's story was released on the front page, with the headline 'Cricket's Betting Scandal'. The article was accompanied by a picture of Waugh with his hand on his head.On the morning of the publication of Conn's article, the managers of Warne and Waugh organised a media conference after Australia's training session. Both players faced a room packed with media and read prepared statements. Both said they had been 'naive and stupid'. Waugh concluded:Much to their discontent, the media were not allowed to ask questions. Patrick Smith of The Age said, 'To deliver such bland explanations to the world media as they did yesterday and then not accept questions was contemptuous of the Australian public they have let down so badly.' The press attention was so intense that when Waugh attempted to relax with a round of golf at a local course, media helicopters flew overhead.The players were widely condemned by the media and public; Prime Minister John Howard stated that he felt an 'intense feeling of disappointment', while former player Neil Harvey called for bans. Malik, whom Warne and Waugh had accused of attempting to bribe them, said that he was delighted at the revelation. The Pakistani player said that the revelations discredited his accusers and vindicated his protestations of innocence. On the preceding tour of Pakistan a few months earlier, Waugh had appeared before a Pakistan Cricket Board judicial inquiry in Lahore to present his claims against Malik; the inquiry questioned the credibility of both Australian players and asked them to return to Pakistan to re-present their accounts of the events.The sports community strongly supported the players. May, the President of the Australian Cricketers' Association, and co-accuser of Malik, pledged his organisation's support for the players, whom he described as 'outstanding servants of Australian cricket'. Waugh received similar statements of support from sports identities. Warne's first Australian captain, Allan Border, defended him, as did former captain and leading commentator Richie Benaud. Sir Don Bradman, widely regarded as the greatest batsman of all time, and former ACB chairman, said that Warne was one of the best influences on Australian cricket for generations, and that the dealings with John did not change this.Media and public opinion was more hostile. The Sydney Morning Herald ran the headline 'Baggy Green Shame' while The Australian wrote of the '11,000 price of disgrace'. Many newspaper columns and letters to the editor attacked the players. The editorial of The Australian stated that 'Waugh and Warne said yesterday they had been naïve and stupid. Put the emphasis on the second adjective—and add greedy.' Readers called for the players to be banned from playing for Australia as well as the sacking of the ACB officials who had kept the matter secret; some said that the players should never be appointed to leadership roles in the cricket community. In the Weekend Australian of 12 December, Warwick Hadfield and Brian Woodley editorialised that 'Warne is in need of some good advice, but not from business managers and PR folk too happy to tell him how wonderful he is in order to flog a few more videos, books, pairs of duds, sports shoes or anti-smoking ads'. Warne's major sponsors reviewed their partnerships with him, and three newspapers, the Daily Mirror of the United Kingdom, The Age of Melbourne and The Sydney Morning Herald severed their ties with him.A few days later, in the wake of the scandal, Waugh was widely jeered by an Australian crowd when he walked out to bat on the first day of the Test. In what he described as the toughest day of his career, Waugh gave an unconvincing and hesitant performance. Waugh managed only seven runs in 36 minutes before being removed by Peter Such, caught and bowled. The cricket writer Peter Roebuck opined that it was the worst home crowd reception for an Australian player that he could remember. Warne was injured at the time and did not play, so he did not have to face the hostile crowd.Later inquiries On 8 January 1999, Pakistan's Judicial Commission held a hearing in Melbourne into bribery and match-fixing. The commission had originally summoned Waugh and Warne to Pakistan but the ACB instead decided to offer them court privileges in Australia. Both Warne and Waugh gave evidence at the public hearing. Waugh seemed nervous and uncertain, whereas Warne appeared assured and confident. They were questioned for approximately 80 and 45 minutes respectively. The Pakistani investigators attempted to link the Australians' dealings with John to various games between Pakistan and Australia in 1994, over which they had suspicions of match-fixing.Immediately after Warne and Waugh had met John in Colombo, Australia defeated Pakistan in a one-day match, scoring 7/179 and restricting Pakistan to 9/151 in reply. There were suspicions that the Pakistanis had thrown the game by batting slowly, although Warne said he had genuinely tried his best, pointing out that he was named man-of-the-match. Warne and May had alleged that Malik offered them money to bowl badly on the final day of the First Test in Karachi. Australia then reduced Pakistan from 3/157 to 9/258, and appeared set for victory, but a last-wicket partnership took them to the target of 314. The win was registered when wicket-keeper Ian Healy missed a stumping chance from Warne and the ball went for four byes. Warne denied that he had thrown the match, again pointing out he was named man-of-the-match. Waugh had alleged that Malik offered him money to help Australia lose a one-day match during the same tour. He denied the allegation that he did so. Waugh scored an unbeaten 121, but it was not enough to prevent Australia from suffering a nine-wicket defeat.Waugh denied betting on cricket, but said he had given John information 'about ten times', contradicting his earlier statement that the pair had only talked on 'a handful' of occasions. Warne testified that he gave pitch and weather information to John before matches three times—a one-day international against England at the Sydney Cricket Ground in December 1994, the Second Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and the Fifth Test at the WACA Ground.Crompton was the last witness. He said that Warne and Waugh's actions 'amounted to a breach of the players' contract in that it brought the game of cricket into disrepute'. He said that it was normal for off-field disciplinary breaches to be dealt with in private, while the fallout of on-field incidents was made public. Compton parried Pakistani accusations that he had covered-up the affair. He said that if the matter had been made public, it would have been confused with bribery. The front-page headline in the Melbourne tabloid Herald Sun subsequently read 'MATCH FIX', accompanied by pictures of Warne and Waugh. The players responded that 'the matter [of the headline] was in the hands of their lawyers'. The next day, the headline read 'INNOCENT'.Following the public outcry over the suppression of the incident, the ACB appointed Rob O'Regan QC to head up a Player Conduct Inquiry. His assistants conducted 60 preliminary interviews and O'Regan made ten himself. O'Regan released his report on 28 February 1999. He described the fines as 'inadequate' as their size 'did not reflect the seriousness of what they had done'. He suggested that a 'suspension for a significant time' was more appropriate.O'Regan said that Australian players were not prepared for playing cricket in Asia, as they were not aware of the dangers of bookmakers and betting on the Indian subcontinent. He recommended that every new player should be warned of the dangers of becoming involved with bookmakers, and the penalties that it entails. The ICC announced that no further action would be taken against Waugh and Warne as they could not be tried twice for the same offence.See alsoBetting controversies in cricketNotesReferencesAustralian cricket in the 20th century Controversies in Australia Cricket controversies Sports betting scandals Sports scandals in Australia", "machine_text": "John the bookmaker controversy refers to a scandal that rocked the sports betting industry in the early 2000s in the United States. John, a popular bookmaker, was accused of manipulating the odds on various sports events in his favor. The controversy exposed deep flaws in the industry's regulation and monitoring mechanisms and sparked a heated debate on the ethics of sports betting. John ran his bookmaking business through a website that attracted hundreds of thousands of customers. He was known for his aggressive marketing tactics and generous bonuses, which made him popular among sports bettors. However, as it later emerged, John's success was not entirely legitimate. The controversy erupted when several sports journalists and analysts noticed that John's odds on some games were significantly different from other bookmakers' odds. Upon further investigation, it was found that John was colluding with some of the teams and players to influence the outcomes of the games. He was also rigging the odds to ensure that he made a profit on every bet placed on his website. The scandal had far-reaching consequences for the sports betting industry. It prompted calls for stricter regulation and better monitoring of bookmakers. It also exposed the vulnerabilities of online sports betting platforms, which were often used by unscrupulous operators to cheat customers. John was eventually indicted and sentenced to several years in prison. His website was shut down, and his customers lost millions of dollars in unpaid bets. The controversy left a lasting impact on the sports betting industry, with many states and countries introducing stricter regulations to prevent similar scandals from happening in the future. Despite the John the bookmaker controversy, sports betting remains a thriving industry worldwide, with millions of people placing bets on their favorite sports events every year. However, the scandal serves as a cautionary tale for anyone involved in the industry to always maintain high ethical standards and adhere to strict regulations to avoid tarnishing the reputation of the industry.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 7847834}

After service in World War I, he was active with Max Reinhardt's Theater in der Josefstadt in Vienna, followed by engagements at various theaters in Munich and Vienna, and then to the Berlin stage where he had a popular following playing singing and dancing roles, including as Prinz Orlofsky in Die Fledermaus.His general manner was humorous, charming, naive, and cheerful.In Berlin between 1930 and 1933 he worked as a recording artist and acted in more than a dozen German light comedy and musical films, most famously as one of Lilian Harvey's suitors in the hugely successful operetta film The Three from the Filling Station.With Hitler's rise to power in 1933, Karlweis, who was Jewish, returned to the Austrian stage; but with the Nazi Anschluss in 1938 he was again forced to flee, first to Switzerland and then Paris where, at both locations, he took to the stage with fellow Austrian law school dropout, writer/director, and cabaret performer Karl Farkas. When German forces took Paris in 1940, Karlweis, along with his friend Austrian writer Friedrich Torberg, fled via Spain to Portugal, whence they made their way to New York.Not knowing English, Karlweis was at first limited to acting in German emmigréproductions, but he soon got his English legs and appeared in eight Broadway shows in the early 1940s, including the title role in Franz Werfel's long-running 'Jacobowsky and the Colonel,' garnering outstanding reviews.In the early 1950s Karlweis played supporting roles in TV productions and in several Hollywood and European films.He died in 1956 of a heart attack in New York, and is interred at the Matzleinsdorf Protestant Cemetery in Vienna.Personal life In 1946, Karlweis married theatrical and film producer Ninon Tallon, the niece of three-time Prime Minister of France Édouard Herriot.

He was one of the most important conductors in Central Europe during the 1920s and 1930s, and his legacy in the classical music world has been preserved through his many recordings and compositions. Garaguly was born in Budapest, Hungary, and began violin studies at the age of six. He later studied at the Budapest Academy of Music, where he was mentored by the famous violinist Jenő Hubay. After completing his studies, Garaguly joined the orchestra of the Vienna State Opera, where he played under the direction of such conductors as Richard Strauss and Gustav Mahler. In 1918, Garaguly was appointed conductor of the Zagreb Philharmonic Orchestra, and he quickly gained a reputation as an innovative and inspiring leader. He also began composing his own music, which was characterized by its lush, Romantic melodies and rich harmonies. In 1925, Garaguly was appointed music director of the Berlin State Opera, a post he held until 1930. During his tenure, he made a number of important recordings, including a celebrated version of Wagner's Tristan und Isolde. He was also known for his collaborations with the famous German composer Richard Strauss, who praised Garaguly's conducting style as 'brilliant and instinctive.' After leaving Berlin, Garaguly continued to conduct and compose, but his career was interrupted by the rise of Nazi Germany. In 1933, he was forced to flee the country after being targeted by the regime for his Jewish heritage. He eventually settled in London, where he continued to conduct and compose until his death in 1938. Despite his relatively short career, Carl von Garaguly remains an important figure in the history of classical music, especially for his pioneering recordings and his contributions to the development of modern conducting techniques.

She was born on April 20, 1586, and died on August 24, 1617, at the age of 31. Saint Rose was the first person born in the Americas to be canonized by the Roman Catholic Church, and she is the patron saint of the Americas, as well as of Peru, florists, and gardeners. Early Life Saint Rose was the daughter of Gaspar Flores, a Spanish colonist, and Maria de Oliva, an Indian woman. She was baptized as Isabel, but later took the name Rose when she became a nun. Saint Rose was known for her beauty, and many men pursued her, but she refused them all, as she had taken a vow of chastity at a young age. Her family was against her decision to become a nun, but she eventually won them over. Life as a Nun Saint Rose joined the Third Order of Saint Dominic, and she lived a life of self-denial, prayer, and penance. She slept on a bed of broken glass, ate only bread and water, and frequently visited hospitals to care for the sick and the poor. Saint Rose had a great devotion to the infant Jesus, and she would often meditate on his life and teachings. Miracles Saint Rose is said to have had many supernatural experiences. She had a vision of Saint Catherine of Siena, who gave her advice on how to live a holy life. Saint Rose also had the gift of bilocation, meaning that she could be in two places at once. In one instance, she was seen in both Lima and in Mexico at the same time. Saint Rose is also said to have performed many miracles, including healing the sick and raising the dead. Canonization Saint Rose was canonized by Pope Clement X on April 12, 1671, and she was the first saint born in the Americas to be canonized by the Roman Catholic Church. Saint Rose's feast day is celebrated on August 23, the day before her death. The shrine of Saint Rose in Lima is a popular destination for pilgrims, and her image can be found in many churches throughout the Americas. Legacy Saint Rose is remembered for her devotion to God and her love for the poor and the sick. She is an example of how faith and love can overcome adversity and inspire others to live a holy life. Saint Rose's legacy continues to inspire people to this day, and her name is synonymous with courage, selflessness, and devotion.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 3837454}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Andrew van der Bijl\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Andrew van der Bijl (born 11 May 1928; known in English-speaking countries as Brother Andrew) is a Dutch Christian missionary, known for smuggling Bibles into communist countries at the height of the Cold War. For his activities, he earned the nickname 'God's Smuggler'. He is known for having prayed 'Lord, make seeing eyes blind' when he was stopped at the border of a communist country for his car to be inspected.Biography Van der Bijl was born in Sint Pancras, the Netherlands, the fourth of six children of a poor, near-deaf blacksmith and an invalid mother. He told John and Elizabeth Sherrill, when they transcribed his memories for their book God's Smuggler, 'From the day I first put on wooden shoes – klompen we call them in Holland – I dreamed of derring-do'.In the 1940s, he enlisted in the colonial army of the Dutch East Indies during the rebellion that would eventually form Indonesia, which first adventure initially had unpleasant results; he endured a period of severe emotional stress while he was serving as a soldier. He was wounded in the ankle during the fighting; during his rehabilitation, he read the Bible obsessively, eventually converting to Christianity. Van der Bijl studied at the WEC Missionary Training College in Glasgow, Scotland.Ministry In July 1955, Andrew van der Bijl visited Communist Poland 'to see how my brothers are doing', a reference to the underground church there. He signed up on a government-controlled Communist tour, the only legal way to be in the country. During that time, he felt called to respond to the Biblical Commission, 'Wake up, strengthen what remains and is about to die' (). That was the start of a mission leading him into several communist-ruled countries in which religious belief was actively persecuted. In 1957, he travelled to the Soviet Union’s capital, Moscow, in a Volkswagen Beetle, which later became the symbol of Open Doors, the organization he founded. An older couple, the Whetstras, had given him their new car because they had prayed about it and believed that Andrew would need the car. A man who lived in Amersfoort, Karl de Graaf, claimed that God told him to teach Van der Bijl to drive. Later, when Van der Bijl was in a refugee camp in West Germany, Philip Whetstra called Van der Bijl to come to the Whetstras' new house in Amsterdam. Although Van der Bijl was violating the laws of all of the countries that he visited by bringing religious literature, he often placed the material in view when he was stopped at police checkpoints, as a gesture of his trust in what he believed to be God's protection. That was the realization of his childhood dreams of derring-do.Van der Bijl visited China inthe 1960s, after the Cultural Revolution had created a hostile policy towards Christianity and other religions, during the so-called Bamboo Curtain. He went to Czechoslovakia when the suppression by Soviet troops of the Prague Spring had put an end to relative religious freedom there. He encouraged Czech believers and gave Bibles to the Russian occupying forces. During that decade, he also made his first visits to Cuba after the Cuban Revolution.God's Smuggler In 1967, he published the first edition of God's Smuggler, written with John and Elizabeth Sherrill. God's Smuggler tells the story of his early childhood, conversion to Christianity, and adventures as a Bible-smuggler behind the Iron Curtain. By 2002, it had sold over 10 million copies in thirty-five languages. A comic book adaptation of God's Smuggler was published in 1972 by Spire Christian Comics.Middle East After the fall of Communism in Europe, he shifted his focus to the Middle East and has worked to strengthen the church in the Muslim world. In the 1970s, he visited war-torn Lebanon several times, stating that 'global conflict in the end times will focus on Israel and its neighbouring countries.'Light Force and Secret Believers In the 1990s, van der Bijl again travelled several times more to the Middle East. In his book Light Force, he tells of Arab and Lebanese churches in Lebanon, Israel and Israeli-occupied areas expressing great delight at the mere visit of a fellow Christian from abroad since they felt that the church in the Western world at large was largely ignoring them.In similar fashion, van der Bijl and a companion, Al Janssen, visited Hamas and PLO leaders, including Ahmed Yassin and Yasser Arafat, and handed out Bibles.Van der Bijl's tenth book, Secret Believers: What Happens When Muslims Believe in Christ, was released on 1 July 2007.BibliographySee also Open DoorsReferencesExternal links Short biography Open Doors International Website Co-author of God's Smuggler talks about writing with such heroes as Brother AndrewBible smuggling Dutch anti-communists Dutch Christian missionaries Dutch evangelicals Living people Royal Netherlands East Indies Army personnel 1928 births Dutch expatriates in the United Kingdom", "machine_text": "Andrew van der Bijl, also known as Brother Andrew, is a Dutch Christian missionary and evangelist who is best known for his work during the Cold War in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Van der Bijl was born on May 11, 1928, in Sint Pancras, Netherlands. At the age of 18, he joined the Dutch Army and served as an intelligence officer for two years. After his military service, he worked as a salesman for a textile company, but he felt that his life lacked purpose. In 1955, Van der Bijl traveled to East Germany to smuggle Bibles to Christian believers who were in desperate need of them. This marked the beginning of his lifelong mission to bring the Gospel to people in closed countries. During the Cold War, Van der Bijl smuggled Bibles and other Christian literature into communist countries including Poland, Romania, Hungary, and the Soviet Union. He became known as 'God's Smuggler' for his risky activities. Van der Bijl's work inspired the creation of Open Doors, a nonprofit organization dedicated to serving persecuted Christians around the world. He also founded the international ministry, which focuses on providing support to the suffering church worldwide. Van der Bijl has written many books, including his autobiography 'God's Smuggler', which has been translated into many languages and has sold over 15 million copies worldwide. The book recounts his remarkable experiences as a missionary in communist countries and how he relied on God's strength to overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Van der Bijl retired from his active duties in 1998, but his legacy continues today through the ministry he founded, which now operates in more than sixty countries. Andrew van der Bijl's dedication to spreading the Gospel to people in closed countries has inspired countless people around the world, and his life has truly been a testament to the power of faith and perseverance.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2169958}

Tang, who was the owner of the property, had sold it to Capacious in 2011. However, he later disputed the sale and claimed that the agreement was made under duress and undue influence. Tang argued that Capacious had used its superior bargaining position to force him into the sale, and that he had no choice but to sign the agreement.

The court ordered Capacious to relinquish its ownership of the property and pay damages to Tang. The case was notable for its impact on Hong Kong's corporate law. The ruling set a new precedent for establishing duress and undue influence in sales agreements, particularly in corporate and property transactions. Overall, Tang Man Sit v Capacious Investments Ltd serves as an important reminder of the need for transparency and fairness in business dealings, and the consequences of engaging in unethical and coercive practices.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 35817630}

Due to the extensive rivers that flow through the country, waterways are an important mode of transportation in Suriname. However, there are also roads, railways, and airports to connect people and cargo across Suriname's diverse terrain. Waterways The rivers of Suriname provide an important means of transportation for people and goods. The Suriname River is the main waterway in the country, connecting the capital city of Paramaribo with other towns and villages upriver. The Marowijne River marks Suriname's eastern border with French Guiana and offers access to the Atlantic Ocean via the Amazon River. Roads Suriname has a network of roads that connect the major towns and cities in the country. The roads are generally in good condition around the populated areas but can be challenging to navigate in the more remote regions. Most of the roads are paved, but there are some unpaved roads in the interior of the country. Railways There is currently no active railway in Suriname. There was a 166-kilometer railway that ran between Paramaribo and the bauxite mines in Moengo, which were closed in the 1990s. There have been discussions about rebuilding the railway to spur economic growth in Suriname but no concrete actions have yet been taken. Airports Suriname has two international airports, Johan Adolf Pengel International Airport and Zorg en Hoop Airport. Johan Adolf Pengel International Airport is the country's primary airport, located approximately 45 kilometers south of Paramaribo. Zorg en Hoop Airport is a small airport that serves domestic and regional destinations in South America. Conclusion In conclusion, transport in Suriname is diverse and relies on multiple modes, including waterways, roads, and airports. Given the country's geography, the rivers provide an important means of transportation for both people and goods. In the future, Suriname can develop its transport infrastructure to facilitate economic growth and connect remote regions with the rest of the country.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 27438}

It lives chiefly in shady woodlands, and grows up totall, producing a cluster of up to 18 pale blue flowers in spring. It was formally described in 1996, having previously been identified as belonging to the related species H. italica.Description Hyacinthoides paivae is a perennial plant which grows from bulbs that are typically× . Each bulb produces 4–7 (more rarely 2–12) basal leaves, eachlong andwide. The stems arelong, and bear an inflorescence comprising 6–18 flowers in a multilateral raceme. Each flower is attached by a pedicellong, and is itselflong bywide. H. paivae can be told apart from H. italica by its broader leaves and larger flowers; H. hispanica differs in having longer, narrower, unscented and bell-shaped flowers.Distribution and ecology Hyacinthoides paivae is endemic to the north-western part of the Iberian Peninsula, including western parts of Galicia (A Coruña, Ourense and Pontevedra provinces) and north-western parts of Portugal (Beira Litoral, Douro Litoral, Minho and Trás-os-Montes provinces). Material of an unidentified species from the Sierra de la Demanda, a small mountain range on the border between Burgos province and La Rioja, matches H. paivae genetically.H. paivae occurs in oak woodland and pine woods growing over Ulex, Erica cinerea and Cistus spp., as well as other shady habitats. It also occurs occasionally on coastal cliffs, and in mown meadows. The typical flowering period is March and April, although it can be as late as June in upland areas, such as Monte Pindo.Taxonomic history In 1990, bluebells assigned to the species Hyacinthoides italica were reported from north-western Spain. Later analyses of the species morphology demonstrated that the plants did not belong to H. italica, which is only otherwise found near the French–Italian border. Instead, it was realised that they represented a new species, which was named Hyacinthoides paivae by Santiago Ortiz and Juan Rodríguez-Oubiña in 1996, the specific epithethonouring the Portuguese botanist Jorge Paiva.The holotype, a specimen from Dumbría, A Coruña province, Spain, is held at the herbarium of the ; isotypes are also kept there, and at the University of Coimbra, theandin Madrid, thein Pontevedra, and at the Natural History Museum and Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in London.Ortiz and Rodríguez-Oubiña initially placed the species in 'Hyacinthoides sect. Somera', but more recent molecular phylogenetic analysis could not confirm any of the existing sections in the genus, and placed it instead in an informal group alongside H. non-scripta, H. hispanica and H. cedretorum.ReferencesExternal linkspaivae Plants described in 1996 Flora of Spain Flora of Portugal Endemic flora of the Iberian Peninsula", "machine_text": "Hyacinthoides paivae is a species of bulbous perennial plant in the family Asparagaceae. It is commonly known as the Paiva's hyacinth. It is native to Portugal, where it is found growing in rocky and shaded habitats, often near watercourses. The Paiva's hyacinth grows from a bulb with a diameter of 1 to 2 cm. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, reaching up to 30 cm in length, with a green color and a glossy appearance. The flowers grow in compact clusters or racemes, with up to 12 flowers per stem. The flowers are bell-shaped with six petals, which are pale to deep blue in color. They bloom in late spring to early summer and are known to attract bees. Hyacinthoides paivae is similar in appearance to the better-known English bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta) but can be distinguished by its smaller size, narrower leaves, and paler blue flowers. It has been classified as a separate species from the English bluebell based on molecular and morphological analyses. The Paiva's hyacinth is considered a rare and endangered species, with a fragmented distribution in Portugal. It is threatened by habitat destruction due to urbanization, agriculture, and riverbank erosion. In 1994, it was listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. Conservation efforts include the protection of its habitat and the cultivation of bulbs for the horticultural trade. In traditional Portuguese medicine, Hyacinthoides paivae has been used as a diuretic and to treat rheumatism and inflammation.

It was released September 18, 2007,by MCA Nashville Records and September 24, 2007, by Humphead Records in the UK, and was produced by Tony Brown, Dann Huff, McEntire, and Justin Timberlake.Reba: Duets was McEntire's second album to appear in the new millennium decade and one of her most successful crossover albums, as it is her first studio album to chart in Australia and her 3rd to chart in the UK. It was her first album to reach #1 on the Billboard 200, while also reaching #1 on the Top Country Albums chart, and was also her final release for the MCA Nashville label. The album featured collaborations from eleven different artists in the genres of country, pop, and rock.The album debuted at #1 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart and the Billboard Top 200 Albums chart with sales of 300,000.Background Reba: Duets was recorded at Starstruck Studios in Nashville, Tennessee. Allmusic reviewer, Thom Jurek considered that the quality of the album's tracks was different from that of most other collaboration projects, calling it a 'mixed bag' of material. The first collaborator on the album was LeAnn Rimes, who recorded the track, 'When You Love Someone Like That' which also appeared on LeAnn Rimes's Family album that same year. Jurek called the duet between the pair 'stellar,' while about.com called the pairing 'an undeniable outcome of perfection. Reba's strong country voice with LeAnn's young, soulful sound created a new sound like no other.'The second track, 'Does That Wind Still Blow In Oklahoma' was a collaboration with Ronnie Dunn (half of the duo BrooksDunn), who co-wrote the song with McEntire. The third track is a duet with Kelly Clarkson on one of her previous major pop hits, 'Because of You.' The song was the album's lead single and had already peaked at #2 on the Hot Country Songs chart at the time of the album's release. The song was criticized by allmusic, saying that, 'the song is simply a big, overblown power ballad with guitars compressed to the breaking point, sweeping strings, and enormous crashing cymbals – think Jim Steinman and you get it.' The same idea was also said about the fourth track, 'Faith In Love' with Rascal Flatts. The fifth track was performed with country artist, Trisha Yearwood on the song, 'She Can't Save Him', which was formerly released as a single by Canadian country artist, Lisa Brokop. Tracks six and seven were collaborations with American pop artist, Carole King and country artist, Kenny Chesney, who both help in providing musical variations towards the album. Country Standard Time called track nine (a collaboration with Faith Hill called 'Sleeping with the Telephone') 'tearful emotion.'The tenth track was a duet with Justin Timberlake on the song, 'The Only Promise That Remains', which was co-written by Timberlake himself. The song is performed in Celtic melody and Timberlake performs harmony on most of the song's length. The album closes with 'Break Each Other's Hearts Again', a duet with Don Henley.Critical receptionReba: Duets gained fairly positive reviews from most music critics. Allmusic's Thom Jurek stated that although he considered it not to be a 'perfect record', he did find the album to 'deliver'. Jurek concluded by saying, 'It's sincere, it's polished, and it's full of good to great songs delivered in mostly interesting ways.' In his review, he gave the album three and a half out of five stars.Reviewing the album, Rick Bell of Country Standard Time gave praise to McEntire and her production on the release, saying, 'Give credit to McEntire for corralling the egos - including her own - and producing an album with depth, passion and a bunch of great voices.'About.com”'s Scott Sexton gave Reba: Duets four and a half out of five stars, overall stating, 'Reba McEntire has proven she can stand the test of time, and with some help from close friends she sounds better than ever.' Reviewing Reba: Duets in 2007, Lana Cooper of PopMatters acclaimed McEntire's vocal strength in the album by saying, 'Reba's voice manages to sound sweet without being syrupy, while being extremely powerful. McEntire's vocal strength yields a different kind of authority than the bluesy, drawling growl of Janis Joplin, the weathered rasp of Marianne Faithfull, or even the soul-shrieking powerhouse of Tina Turner. Instead, Reba's voice combines the aspects of all three singers but tempers it with a Southern sweetness and an unmistakable femininity.' Cooper overall stated, 'Reba Duets is largely a strong showing.'Release and aftermathReba: Duets was originally planned to be released in April 2007, however the date was pushed to September 18 instead. The lead single, 'Because of You' was released to radio May 15 and reached a peak of #2 on the Hot Country Songs chart and #50 on the Billboard Hot 100 in August, shortly before the album's release date. A week after the album's release, it became the United States' best-selling album of the week, debuting at number one on both the Top Country Albums and Billboard 200 albums charts, selling a total of 300,536 copies in its first week, according to Nielsen SoundScan. It debuted at number 4 on the Canadian Album Charts. Reba Duets” was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in October 2007, becoming her twentieth platinum album. The album's second single, 'The Only Promise That Remains' (with Justin Timberlake) was released in November 2007, but only reached #72 on the Billboard Pop 100 and did not chart the Hot Country Songs list. The third single, 'Every Other Weekend' (with Kenny Chesney) was released in 2008. However, the official single featured Skip Ewing as the duet partner instead of Chesney, due to the Chesney version not being 'viable' for radio (due to radio company issues).

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Mikel Laboa\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Mikel Laboa Mancisidor (15 June 1934 – 1 December 2008) was one of the Basque Country's most important singer-songwriters.Considered the patriarch of Basque music, his music has had an influence on younger generations. A testament to this is the tribute album Txerokee, Mikel Laboaren Kantak ('Cherokee: Songs of Mikel Laboa'), published in 1991 by various younger-generation rock and folk music groups. His album Bat-Hiru ('One-Three') was chosen in a reader poll by the local Diario Vasco newspaper as the greatest Basque album in history. Nearly all of his songs are sung in Basque.Biography Mikel Laboa was born 15 June 1934 in Pasaia, Gipuzkoa.He spent nearly two years of his childhood in the town of Lekeitio, Bizkaia. In the 1950s he studied medicine and psychiatry in Pamplona-Iruña. He would constantly balance his artistic career with his medical career, which began at the Children's Neuropsychiatry unit at Patronato San Miguel in San Sebastián, where he worked for almost 20 years.During his student years he became interested in music, influenced by artists such as Atahualpa Yupanqui and Violeta Parra. Following in their footsteps, Laboa would likewise identify himself as a 'political artist.' In 1958 he made his debut at the Teatro Gayarre in Pamplona.During the 1960s he, along with other Basque artists including singer Lourdes Iriondo, Xabier Lete and Benito Lertxundi, founded the cultural group Ez Dok Amairu ('There is no 13'), which in many ways sought to revitalize Basque culture, long dormant under the Francoist regime. They dedicated their focus on the revival and social status of the Basque language. Within this group Laboa came into his own, emerging along with Benito Lertxundi as a prime example of what was called 'new Basque music.'Laboa's music can be described as a combination of tradition, poetry and experimentalism, in the songwriting style of the 1960s and 1970s, but endowed with a strong personal touch and a unique voice. His work combines old standards reinterpreted in modern style, lyrical poetry from authors such as Bertolt Brecht, and suitable compositions. Deserving special mention are his Lekeitioak, experimental songs based on shouts and onomatopoetic sounds.Laboa was a creative force for 35 years, continuing well into his old age until his fragile health kept him away from the stage. He would collaborate often with jazz musician Iñaki Salvador and worked with the Orfeón Donostiarra and other orchestral groups from the Basque Country. Some of his most well-known songs are featured in La pelota vasca ('The Basque ball'), a documentary by Julio Medem. On 11 July 2006 he gave his final performance, opening for Bob Dylan at a 'Concert for Peace' held in the city of Donostia-San Sebastián.A curious feature of his album titles is the fact that they are numeric. This custom began in 1974 with the release of his two-disc Bat-Hiru (1–3). The album 2, with songs based on the writings of Brecht, had been banned by Francoist censorship. This was followed by the double LP Lau-Bost (4–5) and 6. His Lekeitios comprised albums 7 through 11, although only a compilation of these was released through low-key marketing. These were followed by 12, and Laboa skipped number 13 in homage to the group Ez Dok Amairu, whose name means 'There's no 13' in Basque. Afterwards, he released 14, and his live albums 15 and 16. Not including compilations, his most recent release was 17 (Xoriek).His final collaboration was with the Pasaia group Naizroxa, where he contributed to the first and only song on the first disc, 'Iqharaturic.'Mikel Laboa died 1 December 2008 at a hospital in Donostia-San Sebastián at the age of 74.DiscographyLau herri kanta, 1964Ursuako Kantak, 1966Bertold Brecht, 1969Haika Mutil, 1969Euskal Kanta Berria, 1972Bat-Hiru, 1974Lau-bost, 19806 (Sei), 1985Lekeitioak, 198812 (Hamabi), 198914 (Hamalau), 1994Mikel Laboa Zuzenean, 1997Zuzenean II – Gernika, 200060ak+2, 2003Xoriek – 17, 2005ReferencesExternal linksMikel Laboa.

He is considered one of the most important Basque musicians of the 20th century and is credited with reviving Basque music and developing its modern sound. Laboa started his music career in the 1950s as a member of the Basque choral group Orfeón Donostiarra. He was interested in traditional Basque music and began incorporating it into his songs. Laboa's music was heavily influenced by the Basque language, Basque culture, and the historical context of the Basque Country. His lyrics often spoke about the struggles and aspirations of the Basque people, and his music became a symbol of Basque national identity. In 1968, Laboa released his first album, entitled 'Haize Berriak' (New Winds). The album included well-known songs such as 'Txoria Txori' (Bird, Bird) and 'Gure Bazterrak' (Our Borders). 'Txoria Txori', which became an anthem for the Basque Country, has been covered by many artists and has been sung by thousands of supporters of Basque nationalism. Laboa continued to create music and record albums throughout his career, and his influence on Basque music and culture was significant. He was awarded numerous prizes, including the Basque Music Award in 1997 and the gold medal at the Fine Arts Circle of Gipuzkoa in 2007.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Qin (state)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Qin () was an ancient Chinese state during the Zhou dynasty. Traditionally dated to 897 BC, it took its origin in a reconquest of western lands previously lost to the Rong; its position at the western edge of Chinese civilization permitted expansion and development that was unavailable to its rivals in the North China Plain. Following extensive 'Legalist' reform in the 3rd century BC, Qin emerged as one of the dominant powers of the Seven Warring States and unified the seven states of China in 221 BC under Qin Shi Huang. The Qin dynasty it established was short-lived but greatly influenced later Chinese history.HistoryFoundingAccording to the 2nd century BC historical text Records of the Grand Historian by Sima Qian, the Qin state traced its origin to Zhuanxu, one of the legendary Five Emperors in ancient times.One of his descendants, Boyi, was granted the family name of Yíng by Emperor Shun. During the Xia and Shang dynasties, the Yíng clan split in two: a western branch in that migrated across the Ordos Plateau to Quanqiu (present-day Lixian in Gansu), and an eastern branch that settled east of the Yellow River in modern Shanxi. The latter became the ancestors of the rulers of the later Zhao state.The western Yíng clan at Quanqiu were lords over the Xichui ('Western March') region west of Mount Long and served as a barrier for the Shang dynasty against invasions by the Western Rong barbarians. One of them, Elai, was killed defending King Zhou of Shang during the rebellion led by Ji Fa that established the Zhou dynasty. The Yíng clan was however allied with the politically influential marquesses of Shen, whom the Zhou monarch relied upon heavily to manage the Rong people, and was thus allowed to retain their lands and continued serving as an attached vassal under the Zhou dynasty.Feizi, a younger son of Elai's fourth-generation descendant Daluo, impressed King Xiao of Zhou so much with his horse breeding skills, that he was awarded a separate fief in the valley of Qin (present-day Qingshui and Zhangjiachuan County in Gansu) northeast of Quanqiu, and his seat was named Qinyi (in present-day Qintingzhen, Qingshui County). Both branches of the western Yíng clan lived in the midst of the Rong tribes, sometimes fighting their armies and sometimes intermarrying with their kings.It has been suggested by scholars such as Annette Juliano and Arthur Cotterel that having a horse-breeder as their ancestor may imply that the Yíng family had a partial connection to nomadic tribes. As late as 266 BC, it was remarked by a noble of Wei that they shared customs with the Rong and Di tribes; the Central Plains states seemed to hold Qin culture and other peripheral states like Yan and Chu in low regard, due to the marginal location of their states.Qin was the second state after Zhao to adopt cavalry tactics from the nomads.Following the collapse of Zhou Dynasty, the Qin state absorbed cultures from two of the Four Barbarians from the west and north, which made the other warring states see their culture in low esteem. However, the Qin state was sensitive to the cultural discrimination by the Central Plains states and attempted to assert their Huaxia identity. This could be seen in an unusual statute of Qin Law, where mixed-ethnicity offsprings were all categorised as Huaxia, as well as in their preference for importing recruits from the neighbouring state of Jin.In 842 BC, the nobles revolted against the corrupt King Li of Zhou in a coup known as the 'Countrymen's Riot' (國人暴動), overthrowing him the following year, and the country subsequently fell into political turmoil.The Xirong tribes used the opportunity to rebel against the Zhou dynasty, attacking and exterminating the senior branch of Yíng clan at Quanqiu, leaving the cadet branch at Qinyi the only surviving Yíng clan in the west.After King Xuan of Zhou ascended the throne in 827 BC, he made Qin Zhong, Feizi's great grandson, the commander of his forces in the campaign against Xirong.Two years later in 822 BC, Qin Zhong was killed in battle and was succeeded by his eldest son Duke Zhuang. To commemorating Qin Zhong's loyalty, King Xuan summoned Duke Zhuang and his four younger brothers and gave them 7,000 soldiers.The Qin brothers successfully defeated the Rong and recovered their lost patrimony formerly held by the deceased branch of Yíng clan, and King Xuan formally awarded them the territory of Quanqiu.Duke Zhuang then moved his seat from Qinyi to Quanqiu, and had three sons.When he died in 778 BC, his eldest son Shifu wanted to stay fighting the Xirong and avenge their grandfather, turning down the succession, so his second son Duke Xiang ascended as the clan leader.Soon afterwards in 777 BC, Duke Xiang married his younger sister Mu Ying to a Rong leader called King Feng (豐王), in an apparent attempt to make peace.The following year he moved the Qin capital eastward from Quanqiu to Qian (汧, in present-day Long County, Shaanxi), but Quanqiu soon fell to the Rong again after he left.His older brother Shifu, who led the defence of Quanqiu, was captured by the Rong but was released a year later.In 771 BC, the Marquess of Shen collaborated with the Zeng state and the Quanrong nomads, attacked and sacked the Zhou capital Haojing, killing King You of Zhou and ending the Western Zhou dynasty.Duke Xiang led his troops to escort King You's son King Ping to Luoyi, where the new capital city of the Eastern Zhou dynasty was established.In gratitude of Duke Xiang's service, King Ping formally enfeoffed Duke Xiang as a feudal lord and elevated Qin from an 'attached state' (附庸 fùyōng, a minor state with limited self-rule under the authority of another liege lord) to a major vassal state with full autonomy, and further promised to permanently grant Qin the lands west of Qishan, the former heartland of Zhou, if Qin could expel the Rong tribes that were occupying it.The following generations of Qin rulers were encouraged by this promise, and they launched several military campaigns against the Rong, eventually expanding their territories far beyond the original lands lost by the Western Zhou dynasty.The Qin state therefore viewed the Zhou rulers King Wen and Wu as their predecessors, and themselves as the legitimate inheritors of their legacy.Spring and Autumn periodBecause their main concern was the Rongs to the west, Qin's interaction with other states in central China remained minimal throughout the Spring and Autumn period (722481BC), except with its immediate eastern neighbour Jin, a large vassal of the Zhou. Qin maintained good diplomatic relations with Jin through intermarriages between the royal clans, but relations between both sides had also deteriorated to the point of armed conflict on occasions.During the early reign of Duke Mu of Qin, the Jin state was a formidable power under the leadership of Duke Xian of Jin. However, after the death of Duke Xian, Jin plunged into a state of internal conflict as Duke Xian's sons fought over the succession. One of them won the contention and became Duke Hui of Jin, but Jin was struck by a famine not long later in 647 BC and Duke Hui requested aid from Qin.Out of goodwill due to his marriage to Duke Hui's half-sister, Duke Mu sent relief food supplies and agricultural equipment to Jin. However, when Qin was struck by famine the next year, Duke Hui refused to reciprocate with help, leading to the diplomatic deterioration between Qin and Jin and a war breaking out in 645 BC, which ended with Duke Hui being defeated and captured. Duke Mu later released him back to Jin after the latter agreed to cede land and sign an alliance.During the battles with Jin, Duke Mu overheard that one of Duke Xian's exiled sons, Chong'er, was taking refuge in the Chu state. After consulting his subjects, Duke Mu sent an emissary to Chu to invite Chong'er over, and supported him in his challenge and eventual defeat of his brother Duke Hui. After Chong'er become the new ruler of Jin as Duke Wen, he was more grateful to Duke Mu and relations between the two states improved.With his eastern front stable, Duke Mu used the opportunity to launch military campaigns against the Rong tribes in the west.In 630 BC, Qin and Jin agreed to wage war on the state of Zheng, but Duke Mu was lobbied by the Zhen emissary to abandon the alliance.In 627 BC, Duke Mu planned a secret attack on Zheng, but the Qin army retreated after being tricked into believing that Zheng was already prepared for Qin's invasion. By that point Duke Wen had died and his personal alliance with Duke Mu no longer stood, and his successor Duke Xiang ordered an ambush for the retreating Qin army.The Qin forces were defeated at the Battle of Xiao (near present-day Luoning County, Henan) and suffered heavy casualties, and all three of its generals were captured. Three years later, Qin attacked Jin for revenge and scored a major victory. Duke Mu refused to advance further east after holding a posthumous funeral service for those killed in action at the Battle of Xiao, and went back to focus on the traditional policy of expanding Qin's dominance in the west.Duke Mu's achievements in Qin's western campaigns and his handling of foreign relations with Jin earned him a position among the Five Hegemons of the Spring and Autumn period.In 506 BC, King Helü of Wu defeated Chu in the Battle of Boju and captured the Chu capital Ying (present day Jingzhou).Helü's advisor Wu Zixu, who was previously forced into exile by the already deceased King Ping of Chu and craved vengeance for the brutal execution of his father and brother, exhumed the King Ping's corpse and lashed it posthumously.This was a great humiliation for the Chu state, so Shen Baoxu, a Chu official and a former friend of Wu Zixu, travelled to the Qin court and pleaded for assistance from Duke Ai of Qin to recover the capital.After Duke Ai initially refused to help, Shen spent seven days crying in the palace courtyard, and Duke Ai was eventually moved by his devotion and agreed to send troops to assist Chu.The famous poem named 'No Clothes' (), recorded in the Classic of Poetry, was a battle hymn personally composed by Duke Ai to boost the morale of the Qin troops.In 505 BC, the Qin and Chu armies jointly defeated Wu in several battles, allowing King Zhao of Chu to be restored and return to the recaptured capital.Warring States PeriodEarly decline During the early Warring States period, as its neighbours in the Central Plains began rapidly developing, Qin was still in a state of underdevelopment and decline.The Wei state, formed from the Partition of Jin, became the most powerful state on Qin's eastern border.Qin mostly relied on natural defenses such as the Hangu Pass (函谷關; northeast of present-day Lingbao, Henan) and Wu Pass (武關, in present day Danfeng County) in the east, to protect its Guanzhong heartland.Between 413 and 409 BC during the reign of Duke Jian of Qin, the Wei army led by Wu Qi, with support from Zhao and Han, attacked Qin and conquered some Qin territories west of the Yellow River.Legalist reformsAfter suffering losses in the battles with rival states such as Wei, the Qin rulers actively pursued legal, economic social reforms. When Duke Xiao came to the throne of Qin, he issued an announcement calling forth men of talent (including scholars, administrators, theorists and militarists) from other states to enter Qin and help him with his reforms, promising rewards of high offices and lands in return.Among these foreign talents, Shang Yang successfully conducted a series of Legalist reforms in Qin with the support of Duke Xiao, despite facing strong opposition from conservative Qin politicians. Direct primogeniture was abolished, with all commoners granted citizenship rights. Many were resettled in new clusters focusing on increasing agricultural output. Meritocracy was practised throughout, especially in the military, with soldiers and officers receiving due rewards according to their contributions, regardless of their backgrounds. However, tough and strict laws were imposed as well, with draconian punishments being meted out for the slightest of offences, and even the nobility and royalty were not spared. After decades, the reforms strengthened Qin economically and militarily, and transformed it into a highly centralized state with an efficient administrative system.After Duke Xiao's death, King Huiwen became the new ruler of Qin and he put Shang Yang to death by chariot-tearing on charges of treason, but some believed that the king harboured a personal grudge against Shang because he was harshly punished for a minor infraction in his adolescence under Shang's reformed system. However, King Huiwen and his successors retained the reformed systems and they helped to lay the foundation for Qin's eventual unification of China under the Qin Dynasty in 221 BC. Shang Yang's theories were further elaborated later by Han Fei, another Legalist scholar who combined Shang's ideas with those of Shen Buhai and Shen Dao, that would form the core of the philosophies of Legalism. Qin rose to prominence in the late 3rd century BC after the reforms and emerged as one of the dominant superpowers of the Seven Warring States.Ascendancy Qin's power continued growing in the following century after Shang Yang's reform, owing the success to the industriousness of its people. The Qin kings authorized many state development projects, including large public works such as irrigation canals and defensive structures.One of the most obvious results of the reforms was the change in Qin's military. Previously, the army was under the control of Qin's nobles and comprised feudal levies. After Shang Yang's reforms, the aristocracy system was abolished and replaced by one based on meritocracy, in which ordinary citizens had equal opportunities as the nobles to be promoted to high ranks. In addition, military discipline was strongly enforced and the troops were trained to adapt better to different battle situations. Qin's military strength increased largely with the full support of the state. In 318 BC, the states of Wei, Zhao, Han, Yan and Chu formed an alliance and attacked Qin, but did not manage to advance beyond Hangu Pass, and were defeated by counter-attacking Qin forces. The alliance crumbled due to mistrust and suspicion and lack of coordination among the five states.Apart from the effects on Qin's military, Shang Yang's reforms also increased labour for numerous public works projects aimed at boosting agriculture, and made it possible for Qin to maintain and supply an active military force of more than a million troops. This feat could not be accomplished by any other state, except Chu, during that time. Qin's conquests of the southern states of Ba and Shu in present-day Sichuan province also provided Qin with major strategic advantages. The lands in the new territories were very fertile, and helped serve as a 'backyard' for supplies and additional manpower. It was hard for Qin's rivals to attack Ba and Shu, since the territories were located deep in the mountains upstream of the Yangtze River. At the same time, Qin's strategic position in Ba and Shu provided it with a platform for launching attacks on the Chu state, which lies downstream of the Yangtze.Wars against Chu, Han, and WeiDuring the reign of King Huiwen of Qin, the Chu state to the southeast became a target for Qin's aggression. Although Chu had the largest operation-ready army of all the Seven Warring States at over a million troops, its administrative and military strength was plagued by corruption and divided among the nobles. Zhang Yi, a Qin strategist, suggested to King Huiwen to exercise Qin's interest at the expense of Chu. Over the following years, Zhang engineered and executed a number of diplomatic plots against Chu, supported by the constant military raids on Chu's northwestern border. Chu suffered many defeats in battles against Qin and was forced to cede territories to Qin. King Huai I of Chu was furious and ordered a military campaign against Qin, but he was tricked by Zhang Yi into breaking diplomatic ties with his allies, and his angered allies joined Qin in inflicting a crushing defeat on Chu. In 299 BC, King Huai I was tricked into attending a diplomatic conference in Qin, where he was captured and held hostage until his death. In the meantime, Qin launched several attacks on Chu and eventually sacked the Chu capital city of Chen (陳; present-day Jiangling County, Hubei province). The crown prince of Chu fled east and was crowned King Qingxiang of Chu in the new capital city of Shouchun (壽春; present-day Shou County, Anhui province).In the next five decades after King Huiwen's death, King Zhaoxiang of Qin shifted his attention to the Central Plains after the victories in the south against Chu. In the early years of King Zhaoxiang's reign, the Marquis of Rang (穰侯) served as Qin's chancellor and he actively pushed for military campaigns against the Qi state in the far eastern part of China. However, the marquis had his personal motives, as he intended to use Qin's powerful military to help him conquer a fief in Qi territories, since the lands were not directly linked to Qin and would not be under the Qin government's direct administration.Subsequently, King Zhaoxiang's foreign advisor, Fan Sui, advised the king to abandon those fruitless campaigns against distant states. King Zhaoxiang heeded Fan's advice and changed Qin's foreign policy to adopting good diplomatic relations with distant states (Yan and Qi), while concentrating on attacking nearby states (Zhao, Han and Wei). As a consequence, Qin began to launch constant attacks on Han and Wei over the next decades, conquering several territories in its campaigns. By then, Qin's territories had expanded to beyond the eastern shore of the Yellow River and Han and Wei were reduced to the status of 'buffers' from Qin for the other states in the east.Wars against ZhaoStarting from 265 BC, Qin launched a massive invasion on Han and forced Han to cede its territory of Shangdang (上黨; in present-day Shanxi province). However, Han offered Shangdang to Zhao instead, which led to a conflict between Qin and Zhao for control of Shangdang. Qin and Zhao engaged in the three-year-long Battle of Changping, followed by another three-year siege by Qin on Zhao's capital city of Handan. The conflict at Changping was deemed as a power struggle, as both sides pitted their forces against each other not only on the battlefield, but also in the domestic context. Although Qin had an abundance of resources and vast manpower, it had to enlist every man above the age of 15 for war-related duties, ranging from front-line service to logistics and agriculture. King Zhaoxiang of Qin even personally directed his army's supply lines. The extent of mobilization and the exhaustion in the aftermath was not seen in world history for another 2,000 years, until this concept of total war re-entered the stage during World War I. Qin's eventual victory in 260 BC was attributed to its use of schemes to stir up internal conflict in Zhao, which led to the replacement of Zhao's military leaders.Following the Qin victory at the Battle of Changping, the Qin commander Bai Qi ordered the 400,000 prisoners-of-war from Zhao to be executed by burying them alive. Subsequently, the Qin forces marched on the Zhao capital city of Handan in an attempt to conquer Zhao completely. However, the Qin troops were unable to capture Handan as they were already exhausted and also because the Zhao forces put up fierce resistance. King Xiaocheng of Zhao offered six cities to Qin as a peace offer and King Zhaoxiang of Qin accepted the offer after being persuaded by Fan Sui. Within Zhao, many officials strongly opposed King Xiaocheng's decision to give up the cities and subsequent delays caused the siege on Handan to be prolonged until 258 BC. Meanwhile, Bai Qi was consecutively replaced by Wang Xi, Wang Ling and Zheng Anping as the Qin commander at the siege.In 257 BC, Qin was still unable to penetrate Handan after besieging it for three years, and Zhao requested aid from the neighbouring states of Wei and Chu. Wei was hesitant to help Zhao initially, but launched an attack on Qin after seeing that Qin was already exhausted after years of war. The Qin forces crumbled and retreated and Zheng Anping surrendered. The combined forces of Wei and Chu continued to pursue the retreating Qin army and Wei managed to retake part of its original lands that were lost to Qin earlier.Infrastructural works In the middle of the 3rd century BC, Zheng Guo, a hydraulic engineer from the Han state, was sent to Qin to advise King Zhaoxiang of Qin on constructing irrigation canals. Qin had a penchant for building large-scale canals, as evident from its Min River irrigation system. King Zhaoxiang approved Zheng Guo's idea on constructing an even bigger canal. The project was completed in 264 BC and the canal was named after Zheng. Qin benefitted from the project as it became one of the most fertile states in China due to the good irrigation system, and also because it could now raise more troops as a consequence of increased agricultural yield.UnificationIn 247 BC, the 13-year-old Ying Zheng became king of Qin after the sudden death of King Zhuangxiang. However, Ying Zheng did not wield state power fully in his hands until 238 BC, after eliminating his political rivals Lü Buwei and Lao Ai. Ying formulated a plan for conquering the other six states and unifying China with help from Li Si and Wei Liao.In 230 BC, Qin attacked Han, the weakest of the Seven Warring States, and succeeded in conquering Han within a year. Since 236 BC, Qin had been launching several assaults on Zhao, which had been devastated by its calamitous defeat at the Battle of Changping three decades ago. Although Qin faced strong resistance from the Zhao forces, led by general Li Mu, it still managed to defeat the Zhao army by using a ploy to sow discord between King Qian of Zhao and Li Mu, causing King Qian to order Li Mu's execution and replace Li with the less competent Zhao Cong. Zhao eventually fell to Qin in 228 BC after the capital city of Handan was taken. However, a Zhao noble managed to escape with remnant forces and proclaim himself king in Dai. Dai fell to Qin six years later.After the fall of Zhao, Qin turned its attention towards Yan. Crown Prince Dan of Yan sent Jing Ke to assassinate Ying Zheng but the assassination attempt failed and Qin used that as an excuse to attack Yan. Yan lost to Qin at a battle on the eastern bank of the Yi River in 226 BC and King Xi of Yan fled with remnant forces to Liaodong. Qin attacked Yan again in 222 BC and annexed Yan completely. In 225 BC, the Qin army led by Wang Ben invaded Wei and besieged Wei's capital city of Daliang for three months. Wang directed the waters from the Yellow River and the Hong Canal to flood Daliang and King Jia of Wei surrendered and Wei was conquered.In 224 BC, Qin prepared for an attack on Chu, its most powerful rival among the six states. During a discussion between Ying Zheng and his subjects, the veteran general Wang Jian claimed that the invasion force needed to be at least 600,000 strong, but the younger general Li Xin thought that 200,000 men would be sufficient. Ying Zheng put Li Xin in command of the Qin army to attack Chu. The Chu defenders, led by Xiang Yan, took Li Xin's army by surprise and defeated the Qin invaders. The defeat was deemed as the greatest setback for Qin in its wars to unify China. Ying Zheng put Wang Jian in command of the 600,000 strong army as he had requested and ordered Wang to lead another attack on Chu. Wang scored a major victory against the Chu forces in 224 BC and Xiang Yan was killed in action. The following year, Qin pushed on and captured Chu's capital city of Shouchun, bringing an end to Chu's existence. In 222 BC, the Qin army advanced southward and annexed the Wuyue region (covering present-day Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces).By 221 BC, Qi was the only rival state left. Qin advanced into the heartland of Qi via a southern detour, avoiding direct confrontation with the Qi forces on Qi's western border and arrived at Qi's capital city of Linzi swiftly. The Qi forces were taken by surprise and surrendered without putting up resistance. Following the fall of Qi in 221 BC, China was unified under the rule of Qin. Ying Zheng declared himself 'Qin Shi Huang' (meaning 'First Emperor of Qin') and founded the Qin Dynasty, becoming the first sovereign ruler of a united China.Culture and societyBefore Qin unified China, each state had its own customs and culture. According to the Yu Gong or Tribute of Yu, composed in the 4th or 5th century BC and included in the Book of Documents, there were nine distinct cultural regions of China, which are described in detail in this book. The work focuses on the travels of the titular sage, Yu the Great, throughout each of the regions. Other texts, predominantly military, also discussed these cultural variations.One of these texts was The Book of Master Wu, written in response to a query by Marquis Wu of Wei on how to cope with the military threat posed by competing states. Wu Qi, the author of the work, declared that the government and nature of the people were reflective of the terrain they live in. Of Qin, he said:According to Wu, the nature of the people is a result of the government, which is in turn a result of the roughness of the terrain. Each of the states is expounded upon by Wu in this manner.Following a visit to Qin in 264 BC, the Confucian philosopher Xun Kuang noted that Qin society was 'simple and unsophisticated' and their people stood in awe of their officials, but was completely devoid of Confucian literati. Though disliked by many Confucians of its time for 'dangerously lacking in Confucian scholars,' Confucian Xun Kuang wrote of the later Qin that 'its topographical features are inherently advantageous,' and that its 'manifold natural resources gave it remarkable inherent strength. Its people were unspoiled and exceedingly deferential; its officers unfailingly respectful, earnest, reverential, loyal, and trustworthy; and its high officials public-spirited, intelligent, and assiduous in the execution of the duties of their position. Its courts and bureaus functioned without delays and with such smoothness that it was as if there were no government at all.'In his Petition against driving away foreigners (諫逐客書), Li Si mentioned that guzheng and percussion instruments made of pottery and tiles were characteristic of Qin music.RulersList of Qin rulers based on the Records of the Grand Historian by Sima Qian, with corrections by Han Zhaoqi:In popular cultureThe events during the reigns of Duke Xiao, King Huiwen, King Wu and King Zhaoxiang are romanticised in a series of historical novels by Sun Haohui.

The state was located in the western part of modern-day Shaanxi province, and it was bordered by the states of Zhou, Wei, Chu, and Yan. Qin is best known for its military success under the ruler Ying Zheng, who later became the first emperor of a unified China. The origins of the Qin state can be traced back to the 9th century BCE, when its ancestors were one of the many small states that emerged during the Zhou dynasty. However, it was not until the 4th century BCE that Qin started to emerge as a major power. Its early rulers, including Duke Xiao and Duke Mu, adopted a policy of territorial expansion, diplomacy, and military reforms. They also took advantage of the decline of the Zhou dynasty and the weakening of its feudal system. During the 3rd century BCE, the Qin state began a series of wars of unification. The campaigns were led by the ruler Ying Zheng, who was later known as Qin Shi Huang, or the First Emperor. The conquests of Qin included the states of Han, Zhao, Yan, Wei, and Chu. The military success of Qin was due to its efficient army, which was organized into units of 5,000 soldiers, and its use of crossbowmen and cavalry. Qin also implemented a strict legal code, enforced by officials appointed by the central government. In 221 BCE, Ying Zheng declared himself the First Emperor of China, and he unified the country under the Qin dynasty. His reign was characterized by political centralization, legal reforms, the construction of the Great Wall of China, and the standardization of weights, measures, and writing. However, his rule was also marked by authoritarianism, brutality, and the persecution of Confucian scholars. The downfall of the Qin dynasty came after the death of Ying Zheng in 210 BCE. The imperial court was plagued by power struggles, peasant revolts, and the invasion of the Xiongnu, a nomadic tribe from the north. In 206 BCE, the Han dynasty emerged as the new ruling dynasty of China, and it marked the end of the Qin state. Despite its short existence, Qin left a lasting legacy in Chinese history as the first dynasty to unify China and lay the foundations for the imperial system that lasted for centuries.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 361005}

It later passed into the ownership of Farrell's grandson, Norman Hale, and has been used as a cattle ranch ever since. The headquarters is located in Harshaw and includes multiple historic buildings, associated outbuildings, and building foundations.The most prominent of these is the James Finley House, a red brick and adobe structure originally used as the office for the Hermosa Mining Company. Because of its unusual construction—red bricks salvaged from a nearby mine—and its association with the early history of Harshaw, the James Finley House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.Another historic home located on the ranch is the Norman Hale Residence, an adobe house with a tin gabled roof, part of which dates back to the 1880s. Nearby is the Mary Hale Residence, another adobe house with a tin hipped roof, built around the same time as the others and locally referred to as the 'Lions Den'. Further down the road is the ruin of a third adobe building that was originally owned by Ignacio 'Nacho' Arias, who used it as his home and a pool hall.In addition to the old houses and outbuildings, there are the foundations of several historic structures. The most notable is that of the Hermosa Mill, which was originally built in the 1870s when mining operations began. Closer to the James Finley House is the concrete foundations of a two-room frame schoolhouse and a Catholic church built of volcanic tuff, both of which were built in the 1940s and torn down in the 1960s. A smaller rock alignment nearby was part of an assay office from the late 19th century.Two small cemeteries are also located in the area. The main cemetery to the north of the Hale Ranch headquarters and the townsite is known locally as the 'Mexican cemetery', because of the many Mexican-American pioneers buried in the cemetery. A short distance away is the 'American cemetery', which is located on private property and contains the graves of American pioneers, among them Richard Farrell.A few miles to the east of the Hale Ranch headquarters is another historic ranch house owned by the Hale family. Located along the San Rafael Valley road, the home was originally the headquarters for the Ernest Best Ranch, and was used as a filming location for several Western films. The opening scene of the 1971 made-for-television film 'Wild Rovers', starring William Holden and Ryan O'Neal, was shot in the living room of the ranch house.Photo gallerySee alsoSan Rafael RanchReferencesRanches in Arizona 1915 establishments in Arizona Buildings and structures in Santa Cruz County, Arizona", "machine_text": "Hale Ranch is a 27,000-acre working cattle ranch located in the central coast region of California, United States.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Plugola\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Plugola is the illicit business practice of endorsing a product or service on radio or television for personal gain, without the consent of the network or stations. 'Pluggers' have been known to accept bribes of money, alcohol, or free products and services. This contrasts greatly from commercial sponsorship because the benefits of the endorsement go to the individual talent or programmers, while the stations and networks receive no revenue.HistoryIn the 1950s, concern over illicit business practices in television and radio including; plugola, payola, and rigged game shows led to congressional and U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) hearings. In 1959, Attorney General William Rogers reported to President Dwight Eisenhower that deceptive and false advertising and programming was becoming a trend in the United States, and needed to stop. In that same year, FCC Chairman John Doerfer presented his plan to expand public service programming on television networks. The plan called for some public service programming in prime time slots, which did not occur before this. The networks likely had the same agenda as Doerfer, to regain the respect of the viewers, and agreed to Doerfer's plan. By 1960, amendments were made to the Communications Act of 1934 to punish those who engaged in these illicit acts in the future.See alsoRadio promotionPayolaReferencesBroadcasting Advertising", "machine_text": "Plugola is a term used to describe the practice of secretly promoting a product or service on broadcast media through payola or other incentives. This practice is deemed unethical by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), as it undermines the credibility of the media and violates the public trust. The term 'plugola' was coined in the 1950s during the era of radio and television shows. It referred to the practice of radio DJs and TV hosts accepting gifts, cash, or other incentives from record labels, musicians, and other sponsors in exchange for playing their songs or featuring their products on-air. This allowed sponsors to gain an unfair advantage over their competitors and manipulate the preferences of the audience. The problem of plugola became so widespread that the FCC had to intervene and issue regulations to prevent it. In 1959, the FCC adopted the 'Payola Report,' which required broadcasters to disclose any material connections between sponsors and hosts and to keep records of all transactions. Violators could face hefty fines, license revocation, or even criminal charges. Despite these regulations, plugola continued to occur in various forms. In the 2000s, the rise of internet blogging and social media influencers led to new forms of stealth marketing, in which brands paid bloggers or vloggers to promote their products without disclosing their financial incentives. This has led to renewed debates about the ethics of sponsored content and the need for transparency in advertising. In conclusion, plugola is a controversial and unethical practice that undermines the integrity of broadcast media. It remains a challenge for regulators and media companies to prevent and detect, and it requires continued vigilance to protect the public interest.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 31578645}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Ernesto Acher\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Ernesto Acher (Buenos Aires, October 9, 1939) is an Argentine comedian, actor, composer, arranger, multi-instrumentalist and orchestral conductor. Between 1971 and 1986 he was a member of the celebrated Argentine group Les Luthiers, with which he acted as composer, comedian, singer, and performer on more than twenty instruments, some of which he created himself. Before separating from the group, he was involved in individual projects as composer – including a soundtrack, a quartet for clarinet and strings, a string sextet and a symphonic poem for viola and orchestra. In 1988 he founded the La Banda Elástica (The Elastic Band), gathering some of the most outstanding Argentine jazz musicians. The band dissolved in 1993. Since then he has developed several musical and comedy projects, and performed as an orchestral conductor.Background He is Jewish.Training and careerAs a child, he studied piano and, in his teens, as he became interested in jazz, the clarinet. In 1965 he graduated as an architect from the University of Buenos Aires's Architecture and Urbanism School, where he worked also as a teacher on special-structures design. In parallel, he continued his musical studies with Professor Erwin Leuchter. In January 1971 he put architecture aside and devoted himself to music. During the following years he resumed musical studies with José Maranzano, and quite later he took up orchestral conducting with Carlos Calleja.Les LuthiersIn March 1971 he became a member of Les Luthiers, replacing Marcos Mundstock as presenter as well as performer on several both formal and informal instruments. As a composer, his first work for the group was a jazz piece for informal instruments: Tristezas del Manuela (Manuela´s Blues). Upon Mundstock`s return in 1972, Acher was asked to stay as actor, composer, arranger and multi-instrumentist. He was the motor behind the group´s collective format, and in the use of amplification with a view to the new, larger venues in which they were eventually to play. Through his friend Alfredo Radoszynski, who at the time headed the legendary Trova recording label, Acher promoted the group´s recording activity as a means to reach larger audiences. Some of his works are: a cycle of jazz pieces with single-vowel titles (a joint idea with Carlos Núñez Cortés), Miss Lilly Higgins, Bob Gordon, Papa Garland, Pepper Clemens and Truthful Lulu; his folk pieces La yegua mía, Añoralgias and Epopeya de los quince jinetes; Teresa y el Oso (Theresa and the Bear), a symphonic poem for narrator and the informal-instruments ensemble, parodying Prokofiev´s Peter and the Wolf, and transcribed in 1976 for narrator, informal instruments and symphonic orchestra; Quartet Op. 44 for five players, and the Cantata de Don Rodrigo, in cooperation with Jorge Maronna and Carlos López Puccio. His most celebrated main roles are that of Don Rodrigo in the Cantata, the king in El rey enamorado (The lovesick king), and the “little brat” in La gallina dijo Eureka (Eureka, said the hen). The instruments designed and built by Acher include the “valve gom-horn”, the “gom-horn da testa” and the “kalephone”. He also collaborated with Núñez Cortés in the “glamocot” (which can be heard inTheresa and the Bear) and the “clamaneus”, which has never been introduced, and with Carlos Iraldi in designing Antenor, the musical robot in the 1979 show Muchas gracias de nada (Much ado with nothing at all). On top of his talents as composer, arranger and his remarkable ability at different instruments, such as clarinet, bass clarinet, French horn, trombone, piano, accordion, drums and other percussion instruments, plus half a dozen of assorted informal instruments, he was quite expert in approaching different genres and styles.Besides his activity with Les Luthiers, he composed the soundtrack for Carlos Jerusalinsky´s medium-length film Caja de sorpresas (Jack-in-the-box), based on a short story by Ray Bradbury, which received several awards at the 1976 Uncipar Festival, and had his String Sextet performed at the 1978 Contemporary Music Festival at Santiago, Chile, as well as Molloy, a symphonic poem for viola and orchestra, with soloist Marcela Magín and the Buenos Aires Philharmonic under maestro Pedro I. Calderón, in 1980. After his extensive stint with Les Luthiers, he quit the group for reasons that have remained unclear. Acher´s diplomatic explanation is that “Les Luthiers is a multiple marriage, and gentlemen do not ask spouses what went on in their marriage.”The Elastic BandIn early 1988 Acher brought together some of the best Argentine jazz musicians in La Banda Elástica (The Elastic Band). Its members included Carlos Costantini (trumpet,flugelhorn, keyboards, bass, vocals, composing and arrangements), Hugo Pierre (altosoprano saxophone, clarinet), Enrique Varela (tenorsoprano sax, clarinet, vocals); Ernesto Acher (trombone, baritone sax, clarinet, bass clarinet, French horn, piano, vocals, composing and arrangements), Jorge Navarro (piano, keyboards, percussion, vibraphone, vocals), Ricardo Lew (guitars, bass, percussion, composition and arrangements); Juan Amaral (bass, guitar, vocals), Enrique Roizner (drums, percussion). The group´s idea was to approach all genres, from jazz to Argentine folk songs, with both physical and musical humour, and a certain jazzy flavour, which led famous trombone player (and chef) Christian Kellens to assert that 'What you do is like a ministry, ´cause you do jazz all the time, and people enjoy it without perhaps realizing'. Another important feature is that the players´ multiple abilities enabled them to approach nearly any given genre from different instrument combinations. Their first performance, in June 1988, at the Cervantes Theatre, Buenos Aires, was widely acclaimed by audience and critics alike. It was followed by greatly successful seasons in Buenos Aires (Blanca Podestá, Lorange, and del Globo Theatres), and Mar del Plata (Las Estrellas and Colón Theatres), Then came three recordings and a chockfull of awards, plus performances in other Argentine cities, Montevideo (Uruguay), São Paulo (Brazil), and Asunción (Paraguay). In 1991 Acher conceived and organised a show called Together in concert, with The Elastic Band and Camerata Bariloche, Argentina´s most celebrated chamber ensemble. It was a resounding success at the Opera Theatre and Luna Park. The group disbanded in 1993.Other projectsLater in 1993, Acher performed for the first time as a stand-up comedian in Humor, con Acher (Humour with Acher); he also presented his radio programme Los rincones de Acher (Acher´s corners) over FM Del Plata, later over Radio Clásica, FM Palermo, and a few years after that over Radio Universidad de Concepción (Concepción, Chile) and Radio Universidad de Chile (Santiago, Chile). Also that year he performed the first version of his Veladas espeluznantes (Creepy soirées), combining repertoire works with musical jokes, conducting the Rosario Symphony Orchestra, Argentina, with the participation his friends Daniel Schapiro and Carlos Núñez Cortés for the occasion. New versions were performed in Córdoba, Mendoza, Rosario, Bahía Blanca (Argentina) and Concepción, Santiago and Antofagasta (Chile). In 1995 Acher founded the 'Offside Chamber Orchestra', a miniature (23 member) symphonic ensemble specialising in a variegated repertoire, from musical jokes to regular symphonic pieces in reduced arrangements. He participated in countless private events and during a season at the then reopened Lassalle Theatre, Buenos Aires.In 1997, together with his friends, and most celebrated jazz pianists, Jorge Navarro and Rubén “Baby” López Furst, he presented Gershwin, el hombre que amamos (Gershwin, the man we love), with arrangements by himself and López Furst; the show combined the piano duo of Navarro-López Furst with a symphony orchestra, pairing the highest symphonic jazz standards. After two initial presentations at the Avenida Theatre in Buenos Aires in early October, the show stayed on through the end of November, to be repeated the following years in Buenos Aires, Córdoba, Santa Fe and Mar del Plata (Argentina) and São Paulo (Brazil). It ended abruptly in July 2000 with López Furst´s death, which precluded an eventual performance in Los Angeles (USA) with the American Jazz Philharmonic. In 1998 Polygram issued a live recording of the 1997 concert, whilst in September 2010 an album was released including a DVD of that concert plus a CD recording of the first (1986) concert by the Navarro-López Furst duo.In 1999, after some chamber music projects, Acher, as arranger and conductor, along with his friend Jorge de la Vega (solo flutist of the Colon Theatre Orchestra) as soloist, presented Los animales de la música (Music animals) with a forty-member orchestra. The constant pranks between the twain in a humorous and subtle musical context were found highly amusing by both children and grown-ups. Following a successful stint at the Avenida Theatre, the show was again performed at the San Martin Theatre. In 2005, after a short interval, the show made a dashing comeback to the Colon Theatre with more than twenty sold-out performances, and was repeated in Córdoba and Bahía Blanca (Argentina), Asunción (Paraguay) and still is going on.A revised version of the Gershwin project was presented with Jorge Navarro trio and orchestra during the 2006 Easter at the Wine Festival in Mendoza, Argentina. The success led to further performances at the Colon, Coliseum and Opera Theatres in Buenos Aires, the San Martin Theatre in Tucuman, and the Campana Jazz Festival in Buenos Aires province.After having lived for a little over a year in Córdoba, Acher moved to Chile, initially to Concepción, later to Santiago and since 2013 he resides in Linares, 300 km south of Santiago. While in Concepción, he accomplished new projects such as Tribute to Piazzolla, for chamber orchestra, first performed by members of the University of Concepción Symphony Orchestra, and in later years by the Chamber Orchestra of Chile and the School of Modern Music Chamber Orchestra. In 2003 he premiered his Fantasy in Concert, combining five sequences from Disney´s film and live music, and in 2004 his The Orchestra Goes to School, a symphonic/didactic concert, both with the University of Concepción Symphony Orchestra. Before leaving for Santiago, he presented Acher en serio? (Acher… seriously?), conducting a chamber ensemble with works by Jobim, Schreker, Piazzolla and Richard Strauss. In 2006, Acher started a fruitful collaboration with Alejandro García 'Virulo', a Cuban humourist with a long career behind him. With Virulo and two well-known Venezuelan humourists, Emilio Lovera and Laureano Márquez, Acher toured the Humour quartet on a single string in Mexico, Venezuela and Spain, besides a single performance in Havana, Cuba. In December 2009, Acher and Virulo presented in Havana their Symphonic pranks, combining musical jokes and orchestrated versions of Virulo´s songs.Since 2006 Acher has been professor of subjects related to art and literature at the Diego Portales University in Santiago, Chile, whilst continuing with his musical and humour activity.Present timeIn November 2011 he presented in Buenos Aires his Tribute to Piazzolla, recorded and issued by Acqua Records. After a short period as Artistic Director of the Linares Town Hall in 2013, he was appointed as Resident Conductor of the 'Orquesta Clásica del Maule', post which he held until December 2014. After returning in 2014 with his Symphonic pranks in Havanna and Gershwin, the man we love several times in Buenos Aires, he is planning to continue abroad these two projects in 2015 and 2016.Compositions (in chronological order)1971:Manuela's blues (Les Luthiers - instrumental)Tía Ruperta (Les Luthiers - instrumental)1972:Si no fuera santiagueño (Were I not from Santiago) (Les Luthiers - music, with Maronna, and choral arrangement, with Lopez Puccio)La bossa nostra (Les Luthiers - music, with Maronna and Nuñez Cortés)Fiat 125 (Les Luthiers - music, with Núñez Cortés).Pieza en forma de tango (Les Luthiers - arrangements for the studio version, with Núñez Cortés).1973:Les nuits de Paris (Les Luthiers - musiclyrics, with López Puccio and Maronna)Serenata mariachi (Mariachi serenade) (Les Luthiers - music, with Maronna)Miss Lilly Higgins sings shimmy in Mississippi's spring (Les Luthiers - music, for sixteen instruments)1974:Miss Lilly Higgins sings shimmy in Mississippi's spring (Les Luthiers - music, revised version for sextet)La yegua mía (Mare of mine) (Les Luthiers - music)1975:Teresa y el Oso (Theresa and the Bear) (Les Luthiers - music)Bob Gordon shops for hot dogs from Boston (Les Luthiers - instrumental)El explicado (Les Luthiers - music)1976:Caja de sorpresas (Jack-in-the-box) (soundtrack for a medium footage film by Carlos Jerusalinsky)Teresa y el oso (Theresa and the Bear) (Les Luthiers - music, revised version for orchestra and soloists)Two movements for clarinet and strings1977:Visita a la Universidad de Wildstone (A visit to Wildstone University) (Les Luthiers - music)Lazy Daisy (Les Luthiers - lyricsmusic, the latter with Carlos Núñez Cortés)Cantata del Adelantado Don Rodrigo (Les Luthiers - libretto, lyrics and music, with López Puccio and Maronna)Jingle Bass-Pipe (Les Luthiers - music, with Núñez Cortés).1978:String sextet1979:Cartas de color (Coloured letters) (Les Luthiers - music, with Núñez Cortés; libretto, with Mundstock, López-Puccio, Fontanarrosa and Maronna).1980:Molloy (symphonic poem for orchestra and viola, premiered at the Colon Theatre in Buenos Aires, conducted by Pedro Ignacio Calderón).1981:Marcha de la conquista (Conquest march) (Les Luthiers - music, with Núñez Cortés)Quartet Op. 44 (Les Luthiers - instrumental)Papa Garland had a hat, and a jazzband and a mat, and a black fat cat (Les Luthiers - instrumental)Añoralgias (Les Luthiers - music)Siento algo por ti (Les Luthiers - music).Dime si ella (Les Luthiers - music, with Núñez).1983:Cardoso in Gulevandia (Les Luthiers - music)Entreteniciencia familiar (Family techtertainment) (Les Luthiers - music)Pepper Clemens sent the messenger, nevertheless the Reverend left the herd (Les Luthiers - instrumental)El regreso (The homecoming) (Les Luthiers - music)1985:Truthful Lulu pulls thru Zulus (Les Luthiers - instrumental)Epopeya de los quince jinetes (The fifteen horsemen saga) (Les Luthiers - music)1988:Diatriba de amor contra un hombre sentado (A love diatribe against a sitting man) (incidental music)Casi blues (Almost blues) (The Elastic Band)Parapaco (The Elastic Band - with Ricardo Lew)1990:Historia de los blues en fascículos (A blues history in fascicles) (The Elastic Band - with Carlos Costantini and Ricardo Lew)Dedos y luces (Fingers and lights) (The Elastic Band - with Enrique Varela)1992:Un toque de distensión (A touch of distension) (The Elastic Band)2001:La Nona (musical)Rincones (Corners) (symphonic suite)ReferencesExternal linksErnestoAcher.com (Spanish) births Living people Les Luthiers Argentine male comedians Male actors from Buenos Aires Musicians from Buenos Aires Jewish Argentine male actors Jewish Argentine comedians Jewish Argentine musicians", "machine_text": "Ernesto Acher (born July 15, 1956) is an Argentinian musician, composer, and guitar player.

He, however, had been relocated to one of the branches at the time where the KOSPI rallied record-high of 1,007.77 pt and continuously down-turning afterward leading to recession. Despite having gone through hardship, he soon became a director of the branch at the age of 33, the youngest director in the company, and demonstrated the highest result out of 1,000 branches.He recognized how important it is to trust and support each of the colleague's capability when managing a team, an organization, and this teamwork has become one of Mirae Asset Financial Group's core value. The vision of the branch has been “go forward in order to spin the pinwheel although there are no winds”, and this is how Park could have had overcome hardship at his first experience of being a head of a branch. Park received numerous offers proposing a remarkable salary, however, he cannot but reject all the offers in order to achieve his long-cherished dream and goal.Foundation of Mirae Asset Financial GroupHyeonjoo Park founded Mirae Asset Global Investments and Mirae Asset Capital in June 1997 right after leaving the previous company.Within 6 months after the foundation, Mirae Asset suffered from 1997 financial crisis of South Korea, however, showed a tremendous investment performance by believing in South Korea's economy to rebound with contrary investment insights where Park is notable for his adherence to long-term and value investing.In December 1998, Park launched the first retail mutual fund, “Park Hyeon Joo No.1” in South Korea and The Journal of InvestmentPension described that this fund was a great success.Merge and acquisition of Mirae Asset Financial GroupPark has grown Mirae Asset Financial Group into an independent financial conglomerate in South Korea by successfully acquiring a number of financial companies with his contrary investment philosophy and insights.2004.02 Acquired SK Investment Trust Company, an affiliates of SK Group2005.06 Acquired SK Life Insurance, an affiliates of SK Group2011.11 Acquired Horizon ETF, a major ETF player in Canada2011.11 Acquired BetaShares, a major ETF player in Australia2016.12 Merge and acquisition of Daewoo Securities and Mirae Asset Securities2016.12 Acquired KDB asset management company, formerly owned by Korea Development Bank2017.07 Invested Vietnamese life insurance company, PRÉVOIR2017.12 Acquired Korea-based PCA Life Insurance2018.07 Acquired GlobalX, US ETF companyGlobal expansion led by ParkFounder Park always has in mind to expand the business globally since the early stage, and is regarded as a global forerunner in South Korean financial industry.2003.12 Established Mirae Asset Global Investment HK2006.09 Established Mirae Asset Global Investment Vietnam (Hanoi)2006.11 Established Mirae Asset Global Investment India2007.01 Established Mirae Asset Securities HK2007.03 Established Mirae Asset Global Investment UK2007.07 Established Mirae Asset Global Investment Beijing2007.12 Established Mirae Asset Securities Vietnam2008.02 Established Mirae Asset Investment Advisory Beijing2008.04 Established Mirae Asset Global Investment US2008.04 Established Mirae Asset Global Investment Brazil2008.08 Established Mirae Asset Securities US2008.08 Established Mirae Asset Investment Advisory Shanghai2010.08 Established Mirae Asset Securities Brazil2012.10 Established Horizons ETFs LatAM2016.01 Established Mirae Asset Global Investment Australia2017.10 Established Mirae Asset Daewoo India 2019.09 Formed GlobalX Japan joint ventured with Daiwa SecuritiesNotable global investments led by ParkPark led to achieving notable global investment activities of noteworthy landmarks in primary cities.2011.08 Acquired major shares of Titleist2013.09 Acquired Four Seasons Hotel, Sydney2014.12 Acquired major shares of FRB building (1801 K St.), Washington DC, US2015.05 Acquired major shares of The Fairmont Orchid, Hawaii2015.12 Acquired major shares of Fairmont San Francisco2016.07 Acquired major shares of Amazon head office, Phase VIII2016.09 Acquired major shares of Hyatt Regency Waikiki Beach ResortSpaPhilanthropyMirae Asset Park Hyeon Joo FoundationPark has been donating all his dividend payouts of shares to the foundation.Park founded Mirae Asset Education Foundation in 1998 and Mirae Asset Park Hyeon Joo Foundation in 2000 in order to fulfill his corporate social responsibility of 'Building a Caring Capitalist Society,’.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Reserved word\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "In a computer language, a reserved word (also known as a reserved identifier) is a word that cannot be used as an identifier, such as the name of a variable, function, or label – it is 'reserved from use'. This is a syntactic definition, and a reserved word may have no user-define meaning.A closely related and often conflated notion is a keyword, which is a word with special meaning in a particular context. This is a semantic definition. By contrast, names in a standard library but not built into the language are not considered reserved words or keywords. The terms 'reserved word' and 'keyword' are often used interchangeably – one may say that a reserved word is 'reserved for use as a keyword' – and formal use varies from language to language; for this article we distinguish as above.In general reserved words and keywords need not coincide, but in most modern languages keywords are a subset of reserved words, as this makes parsing easier, since keywords cannot be confused with identifiers. In some languages, like C or Python, reserved words and keywords coincide, while in other languages, like Java, all keywords are reserved words, but some reserved words are not keywords – these are 'reserved for future use'. In yet other languages, such as the older languages ALGOL, FORTRAN and PL/I, there are keywords but no reserved words, with keywords being distinguished from identifiers by other means. This makes parsing more difficult with look-ahead parsers necessary.Distinction The sets of reserved words and keywords in a language often coincide or are almost equal, and the distinction is subtle, so the terms are often used interchangeably. However, in careful usage they are distinguished.Making keywords be reserved words makes lexing easier, as a string of characters will unambiguously be either a keyword or an identifier, without depending on context; thus keywords are usually a subset of reserved words. However, reserved words need not be keywords – for example, in Java, goto is a reserved word, but has no meaning and does not appear in any production rules in the grammar. This is usually done for forward compatibility, so a reserved word may become a keyword in a future version without breaking existing programs.Conversely, keywords need not be reserved words, with their role understood from context, or they may be distinguished in another manner, such as by stropping. For example, the phrase if = 1 is unambiguous in most grammars, since a control statement of an if clause cannot start with an =, and thus is allowed in some languages, such as FORTRAN. Alternatively, in ALGOL 68, keywords must be stropped – marked in some way to distinguished – in the strict language by listing in bold, and thus are not reserved words. Thus in the strict language the following expression is legal, as the bold keyword if does not conflict with the ordinary identifier if: if if eq 0 then 1 fi However, in ALGOL 68 there is also a stropping regime in which keywords are reserved words, an example of how these distinct concepts often coincide; this is followed in many modern languages.SyntaxA reserved word is one that 'looks like' a normal word, but is not allowed to be used as a normal word. Formally this means that it satisfies the usual lexical syntax (syntax of words) of identifiers – for example, being a sequence of letters – but cannot be used where identifiers are used. For example, the word if is commonly a reserved word, while x generally is not, so x = 1 is a valid assignment, but if = 1 is not.Keywords have varied uses, but primarily fall into a few classes: part of the phrase grammar (specifically a production rule with nonterminal symbols), with various meanings, often being used for control flow, such as the word if in most procedural languages, which indicates a conditional and takes clauses (the nonterminal symbols); names of primitive types in a language that support a type system, such as int; primitive literal values such as true for Boolean true; or sometimes special commands like exit. Other uses of keywords in phrases are for input/output, such as print.The distinct definitions are clear when a language is analyzed by a combination of a lexer and a parser, and the syntax of the language is generated by a lexical grammar for the words, and a context-free grammar of production rules for the phrases. This is common in analyzing modern languages, and in this case keywords are a subset of reserved words, as they must be distinguished from identifiers at the word level (hence reserved words) to be syntactically analyzed differently at the phrase level (as keywords).In this case reserved words are defined as part of the lexical grammar, and are each tokenized as a separate type, distinct from identifiers. In conventional notation, the reserved words if and then for example are tokenized as types IF and THEN, respectively, while x and y are both tokenized as type Identifier.Keywords, by contrast, syntactically appear in the phrase grammar, as terminal symbols. For example, the production rule for a conditional expression may be IF Expression THEN Expression. In this case IF and THEN are terminal symbols, meaning 'a token of type IF or THEN, respectively' – and due to the lexical grammar, this means the string if or then in the original source. As an example of a primitive constant value, true may be a keyword representing the boolean value 'true', in which case it should appear in the grammar as a possible expansion of the production BinaryExpression, for instance.Reserved ranges Beyond reserving specific lists of words, some languages reserve entire ranges of words, for use as private spaces for future language version, different dialects, compiler vendor-specific extensions, or for internal use by a compiler, notably in name mangling.This is most often done by using a prefix, often one or more underscores. C and C++ are notable in this respect: C99 reserves identifiers that start with two underscores or an underscore followed by an uppercase letter, and further reserves identifiers that start with a single underscore (in the ordinary and tag spaces) for use in file scope; with C++03 further reserves identifiers that contain a double underscore anywhere – this allows the use of a double underscore as a separator (to connect user identifiers), for instance.The frequent use of a double underscores in internal identifiers in Python gave rise to the abbreviation dunder; this was coined by Mark Jackson and independently by Tim Hochberg, within minutes of each other, both in reply to the same question in 2002.Specification The list of reserved words and keywords in a language are defined when a language is developed, and both form part of a language's formal specification. Generally one wishes to minimize the number of reserved words, to avoid restricting valid identifier names. Further, introducing new reserved words breaks existing programs that use that word (it is not backwards compatible), so this is avoided. To prevent this and provide forward compatibility, sometimes words are reserved without having a current use (a reserved word that is not a keyword), as this allows the word to be used in future without breaking existing programs. Alternatively, new language features can be implemented as predefineds, which can be overridden, thus not breaking existing programs.Reasons for flexibility include allowing compiler vendors to extend the specification by including non-standard features, different standard dialects of language to extend it, or future versions of the language to include additional features. For example, a procedural language may anticipate adding object-oriented capabilities in a future version or some dialect, at which point one might add keywords like class or object. To accommodate this possibility, the current specification may make these reserved words, even if they are not currently used.A notable example is in Java, where const and goto are reserved words — they have no meaning in Java but they also cannot be used as identifiers. By reserving the terms, they can be implemented in future versions of Java, if desired, without breaking older Java source code. For example, there was a proposal in 1999 to add C++-like const to the language, which was possible using the const word, since it was reserved but currently unused; however, this proposal was rejected – notably because even though adding the feature would not break any existing programs, using it in the standard library (notably in collections) would break compatibility. JavaScript also contains a number of reserved words without special functionality; the exact list varies by version and mode.Languages differ significantly in how frequently they introduce new reserved words or keywords and how they name them, with some languages being very conservative and introducing new keywords rarely or never, to avoid breaking existing programs, while other languages introduce new keywords more freely, requiring existing programs to change existing identifiers that conflict. A case study is given by new keywords in C11 compared with C++11, both from 2011 – recall that in C and C++, identifiers that begin with an underscore followed by an uppercase letter are reserved:That is, C11 introduced the keyword _Thread_local within an existing set of reserved words (those with a certain prefix), and then used a separate facility (macro processing) to allow its use as if it were a new keyword without any prefixing, while C++11 introduce the keyword thread_local despite this not being an existing reserved word, breaking any programs that used this, but without requiring macro processing.Predefined names A related notion to reserved words are predefined functions, methods, subroutines, or variables, particularly library routines from the standard library. These are similar in that they are part of the basic language, and may be used for similar purposes. However, these differ in that the name of a predefined function, method, or subroutine is typically categorized as an identifier instead of a reserved word, and is not treated specially in the syntactic analysis. Further, reserved words may not be redefined by the programmer, but predefineds can often be overridden in some capacity.Languages vary as to what is provided as a keyword and what is a predefined. Some languages, for instance, provide keywords for input/output operations whereas in others these are library routines. In Python (versions earlier than 3.0) and many BASIC dialects, print is a keyword. In contrast, the C, Lisp, and Python 3.0 equivalents printf, format, and print are functions in the standard library. Similarly, in Python prior to 3.0, None, True, and False were predefined variables, but not reserved words, but in Python 3.0 they were made into reserved words.DefinitionSome use the terms 'keyword' and 'reserved word' interchangeably, while others distinguish usage, say by using 'keyword' to mean a word that is special only in certain contexts but 'reserved word' to mean a special word that cannot be used as a user-defined name. The meaning of keywords — and, indeed, the meaning of the notion of keyword — differs widely from language to language. Concretely, in ALGOL 68, keywords are stropped (in the strict language, written in bold) and are not reserved words – the unstropped word can be used as an ordinary identifier.The 'Java Language Specification' uses the term 'keyword'. The ISO 9899 standard for the C programming language uses the term 'keyword'.In many languages, such as C and similar environments like C++, a keyword is a reserved word which identifies a syntactic form. Words used in control flow constructs, such as if, then, and else are keywords. In these languages, keywords cannot also be used as the names of variables or functions.In some languages, such as ALGOL and Algol 68, keywords cannot be written verbatim, but must be stropped. This means that keywords must be marked somehow. E.g. by quoting them or by prefixing them by a special character. As a consequence, keywords are not reserved words, and thus the same word can be used for as a normal identifier. However, one stropping regime was to not strop the keywords, and instead have them simply be reserved words.Some languages, such as PostScript, are extremely liberal in this approach, allowing core keywords to be redefined for specific purposes.In Common Lisp, the term 'keyword' (or 'keyword symbol') is used for a special sort of symbol, or identifier. Unlike other symbols, which usually stand for variables or functions, keywords are self-quoting and self-evaluating:98 and are interned in the KEYWORD package. Keywords are usually used to label named arguments to functions, and to represent symbolic values.The symbols which name functions, variables, special forms and macros in the package named COMMON-LISP are basically reserved words. The effect of redefining them is undefined in ANSI Common Lisp. Binding them is possible. For instance the expression (if if case or) is possible, when if is a local variable. The leftmost if refers to the if operator; the remaining symbols are interpreted as variable names. Since there is a separate namespace for functions and variables, if could be a local variable. In Common Lisp, however, there are two special symbols which are not in the keyword package: the symbols t and nil.When evaluated as expressions, they evaluate to themselves. They cannot be used as the names of functions or variables, so are de facto reserved. (let ((t 42))) is a well-formed expression, but the let operator will not permit the usage.Typically, when a programmer attempts to use a keyword for a variable or function name, a compilation error will be triggered. In most modern editors, the keywords are automatically set to have a particular text colour to remind or inform the programmers that they are keywords.In languages with macros or lazy evaluation, control flow constructs such as if can be implemented as macros or functions. In languages without these expressive features, they are generally keywords.Comparison by languagesNot all languages have the same numbers of reserved words.For example, Java (and other C derivatives) has a rather sparse complement of reserved words—approximately 50 – whereas COBOL has approximately 400.At the other end of the spectrum, pure Prolog and PL/I have none at all.The number of reserved words in a language has little to do with how “powerful” a language is.COBOL was designed in the 1950s as a business language and was made to be self-documenting using English-like structural elements such as verbs, clauses, sentences, sections and divisions.C, on the other hand, was written to be very terse (syntactically) and to get more text on the screen.For example, compare the equivalent blocks of code from C and COBOL to calculate weekly earnings:// Calculation in C:if (salaried)amount = 40 * payrate;elseamount = hours * payrate;*> Calculation in COBOL:IF Salaried THENMULTIPLY Payrate BY 40 GIVING AmountELSEMULTIPLY Payrate BY Hours GIVING AmountEND-IF.*> Other example of calculation in COBOL:IF SalariedCOMPUTE Amount = Payrate * 40ELSECOMPUTE Amount = hours * payrateEND-IF.Pure Prolog logic is expressed in terms of relations, and execution is triggered by running queries over these relations.Constructs such as loops are implemented using recursive relationships.All three of these languages can solve the same types of “problems” even though they have differing numbers of reserved words.This “power” relates to their belonging to the set of Turing-complete languages.Disadvantages Definition of reserved words in a language raises problems.The language may be difficult for new users to learn because of a long list of reserved words to memorize which can't be used as identifiers.It may be difficult to extend the language because addition of reserved words for new features might invalidate existing programs or, conversely, 'overloading' of existing reserved words with new meanings can be confusing.Porting programs can be problematic because a word not reserved by one system/compiler might be reserved by another.Because reserved words cannot be used as identifiers, users may choose deliberate misspellings of reserved words as identifiers instead, such asfor Java variables of type .Reserved words and language independenceMicrosoft's .NETCommon Language Infrastructure (CLI) specification allows code written in 40+ different programming languages to be combined into a final product.Because of this, identifier/reserved word collisions can occur when code implemented in one language tries to execute code written in another language.For example, a Visual Basic.NET library may contain a class definition such as:' Class Definition of This in Visual Basic.NET:Public Class this' This class does something... End ClassIf this is compiled and distributed as part of a toolbox, a C# programmer, wishing to define a variable of type “this” would encounter a problem: 'this' is a reserved word in C#. Thus, the following will not compile in C#:// Using This Class in C#:this x = new this();// Won't compile!A similar issue arises when accessing members, overriding virtual methods, and identifying namespaces.This is resolved by stropping. In order to work around this issue, the specification allows the programmer to (in C#) place the at-sign before the identifier which forces it to be considered an identifier rather than a reserved word by the compiler:// Using This Class in C#:@this x = new @this();// Will compile!For consistency, this usage is also permitted in non-public settings such as local variables, parameter names, and private members.See alsoC reserved keywordsList of Java keywordsSymbol (programming)ReferencesProgramming constructs Programming language topics", "machine_text": "Reserved word A reserved word is a term in computer programming that is reserved by a programming language syntax to identify specific functions, operations, or instructions. These words are reserved to avoid confusion with user-defined variables, functions, or other identifiers. The reserved words are part of the language's core functionality and are treated separately from other identifiers, such as variable names and function names. Reserved words in Programming language: Most programming languages have a set of reserved words, each with a specific meaning. Some commonly used programming languages, such as C, Java, and Python, have words such as if, else, for, and while reserved as keywords. These words are integral to the language's syntax, and they cannot be used as variable names or in other contexts. Usage of Reserved Words: Reserved words play a crucial role in the programming language, and their proper use is essential for any program to work correctly. Using reserved words inappropriately can cause syntax errors and other runtime issues that can be challenging to debug. Examples of Reserved Words: Here are some examples of reserved words in the programming language Python. 1. and, or: Logical AND and OR operators. 2. def: Defines a new function. 3. if, elif, else: Conditionals used for branching. 4. for, in: Loops used for iteration. 5. return: Returns a value from a function. 6. try, except: Used for error handling. 7. class: Defines a new class. Wrapping Up: Reserved words have an essential role in the programming languages that use them. Programmers must be aware of these words and use them appropriately to ensure that their code functions correctly. Reserved words can sometimes cause confusion, but with proper usage, they offer an efficient way to write programs that are concise and easy to read.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 49723}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Breit equation\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Breit equation is a relativistic wave equation derived by Gregory Breit in 1929 based on the Dirac equation, which formally describes two or more massive spin-1/2 particles (electrons, for example) interacting electromagnetically to the first order in perturbation theory. It accounts for magnetic interactions and retardation effects to the order of 1/c2. When other quantum electrodynamic effects are negligible, this equation has been shown to give results in good agreement with experiment.It was originally derived from the Darwin Lagrangian but later vindicated by the Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory and eventually quantum electrodynamics.IntroductionThe Breit equation is not only an approximation in terms of quantum mechanics, but also in terms of relativity theory as it is not completely invariant with respect to the Lorentz transformation. Just as does the Dirac equation, it treats nuclei as point sources of an external field for the particles it describes. For N particles, the Breit equation has the form (rij is the distance between particle i and j):whereis the Dirac Hamiltonian (see Dirac equation) for particle i at position ri and φ(ri) is the scalar potential at that position; qi is the charge of the particle, thus for electrons qi = −e. The one-electron Dirac Hamiltonians of the particles, along with their instantaneous Coulomb interactions 1/rij, form the Dirac-Coulomb operator. To this, Breit added the operator (now known as the (frequency-independent) Breit operator):where the Dirac matrices for electron i: a(i) = [αx(i), αy(i), αz(i)]. The two terms in the Breit operator account for retardation effects to the first order. The wave function Ψ in the Breit equation is a spinor with 4N elements, since each electron is described by a Dirac bispinor with 4 elements as in the Dirac equation, and the total wave function is the tensor product of these.Breit HamiltoniansThe total Hamiltonian of the Breit equation, sometimes called the Dirac-Coulomb-Breit Hamiltonian (HDCB) can be decomposed into the following practical energy operators for electrons in electric and magnetic fields (also called the Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian), which have well-defined meanings in the interaction of molecules with magnetic fields (for instance for nuclear magnetic resonance):in which the consecutive partial operators are:is the nonrelativistic Hamiltonian ( is the stationary mass of particle i).is connected to the dependence of mass on velocity: .is a correction that partly accounts for retardation and can be described as the interaction between the magnetic dipole moments of the particles, which arise from the orbital motion of charges (also called orbit–orbit interaction).is the classical interaction between the orbital magnetic moments (from the orbital motion of charge) and spin magnetic moments (also called spin–orbit interaction). The first term describes the interaction of a particle's spin with its own orbital moment (F(ri) is the electric field at the particle's position), and the second term between two different particles.is a nonclassical term characteristic for Dirac theory, sometimes called the Darwin term.is the magnetic moment spin-spin interaction. The first term is called the contact interaction, because it is nonzero only when the particles are at the same position; the second term is the interaction of the classical dipole-dipole type.is the interaction between spin and orbital magnetic moments with an external magnetic field H. where:andis the Bohr magneton.See also Bethe–Salpeter equation Darwin Lagrangian Two-body Dirac equations Positronium Wheeler–Feynman absorber theoryReferencesExternal links- Tensor form of the Breit equation, Institute of Theoretical Physics, Warsaw University.- Solving Nonperturbatively the Breit equation for Parapositronium, Institute of Theoretical Physics, Warsaw University.Quantum mechanics Equations of physics", "machine_text": "Breit equation is a quantum mechanical equation that describes the scattering of two particles due to electromagnetic interactions. It was developed by Gregory Breit and Eugene Wigner in 1936 and has been a widely-used tool in nuclear and particle physics ever since. The equation takes into account the exchange of virtual photons between the two particles, as well as their respective masses and charges. The Breit equation is derived from the Dirac equation, which is a relativistic equation for describing the behavior of particles with spin 1/2, such as electrons. The Breit equation can be used to calculate cross sections and spin observables in scattering experiments involving particles such as electrons, positrons, protons, and neutrons. It is particularly useful in studying nuclear and atomic systems, as well as particle decays and interactions. One of the major advantages of the Breit equation is that it incorporates both relativistic and quantum mechanical effects, making it a more accurate description of particle interactions than classical physics or non-relativistic quantum mechanics. However, it is also a complex equation that requires sophisticated mathematical techniques to solve. The Breit equation has contributed to many important discoveries in nuclear and particle physics over the past century. For example, it has been used to study the properties of exotic nuclei, such as those with very short lifetimes or unusual numbers of neutrons and protons. It has also been used to analyze the scattering of electrons on atomic nuclei, which has provided important insights into the structure of matter. Overall, the Breit equation remains an essential tool in modern particle and nuclear physics research, and continues to play a significant role in advancing our understanding of the fundamental forces of nature.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1989515}

Juniperus chinensis is widely distributed in China and can be found in areas like Gansu, Hebei, Henan, Hubei, Shaanxi, Shandong, Shanxi, and Xinjiang. It has also been naturalized in several other countries, including the United States, France, and Korea. The Chinese juniper typically grows to be 10-20 meters tall, although it can reach heights of up to 40 meters in the right conditions. Its bark is gray-brown and fissured with stringy strips peeling away from the tree. The leaves are arranged in opposite pairs, with a scale-like or needle-like appearance, depending on the tree's age and location on the branches. The foliage is typically dark green and can turn bronze or purple in winter. The Chinese juniper is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female trees. The flowers are small, and the fruit is a blue-black berry, which is used in traditional Chinese medicine for respiratory ailments and as a general tonic. The seeds inside the berry contain a volatile oil that is used in the perfume industry. Chinese juniper is a popular ornamental plant worldwide, known for its attractive foliage and resistance to drought and cold. Its wood is also used for making furniture and as a fuel source. The tree has been cultivated in varying shapes, including shrubs, bonsai, and mature trees. Aside from its aesthetic and commercial value, Chinese juniper has also contributed to Chinese culture, as it is often used as a symbol of longevity, immortality, and prosperity in traditional Chinese painting and poetry. In Chinese mythology, it is said to have healing powers and is a popular emblem of good luck. Despite its many uses and cultural significance, Chinese juniper is currently threatened by habitat loss and deforestation. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it as a species of 'least concern' for its overall conservation status, but its populations in some areas may still require protection and management to ensure their survival.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1029596}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Springside (Poughkeepsie, New York)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Springside was the estate of Matthew Vassar in Poughkeepsie, New York, United States. It is located on Academy Street just off US 9. Detailed plans for a landscape, villa, and complex of farm buildings were drawn up by the influential Andrew Jackson Downing with assistance of Calvert Vaux prior to the former's death. The landscaping was completed and remains Downing's most intact surviving landscape, but only a few of the buildings he planned were ever built; most have since been lost to fire and structural failure. A cottage where Vassar resided was dismantled and removed in the mid-1970s. Its facade is on display in the New York State Museum.Downing's landscape, in the English landscape gardening tradition, has survived several serious efforts to redevelop the property in the last half-century due to opposition from local preservationists. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Matthew Vassar Estate, and further it was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1969, but the estate was not permanently protected for almost two decades, when a lawsuit was settled with the transfer of the land to its current owners, Springside Landscape Restoration.HistorySpringside's development took up much of the last two years of Downing's life, and the latter years of Vassar's. The unfinished estate was maintained and developed by several other families for a century afterward. Their descendants were more amenable to selling the land for development in the years afterward, which led in turn to the efforts to protect and restore it.Planning and development under VassarThe Springside property was the 'Allen farm', first a family farm, then an ornamental farm of roughly 45 acres (18 ha), twice its current size. It takes its name from a spring on the property. It was considered as a site for a cemetery by the then-village of Poughkeepsie in 1848. Vassar, a village trustee and founder of the nearby college that bears his name, bought the property from its last owner George Bloom Evertsonfor 8,000, intending to sell subscriptions to future plots at the cemetery to local investors, a common practice at the time. However, there were few takers. He had planned to develop the property as a private summer estate himself if the cemetery plan failed, and so he contracted Downing, who lived downriver in Newburgh, to begin planning the landscape for the property.By 1851, Downing, in collaboration with his associate Calvert Vaux and Vassar, had detailed landscape plans ready. The next year, the city of Poughkeepsie chose another site for the cemetery, ending that possibility. Downing's death in a steamboat boiler explosion the following year did not halt development, as Vassar and Vaux continued along the lines Downing had established. At least two of Downing's planned structures, a barn and a gardeners' cottage, were built, and he eventually invested100,000 in developing the site. The villa they designed to be the main house of the estate, a semi-Jacobethan work, was abandoned (although artists' renderings survive), since Vassar preferred the cottage as a residence.As Springside continued to grow and develop, Vassar regularly opened the lands to the public until he retired to it full-time in 1867, the year before his death. It became a popular place to visit and inspired poetry and songs. One visitor, Russell Comstock, wrote:After Vassar After Vassar's death, the lands were divided among several other local families, who continued to work the landscape. Judge Homer Nelson, New York's Secretary of State, bought the southern half of the property and renamed it Hudson Knolls. He lived elsewhere while a boardinghouse operated on the site. The northern half was purchased by local shoe manufacturer John Whitehouse, who merged it with his own adjoining property to the west of the site, retaining the Springside name. It passed to his son-in-law Eugene Howell upon his death, who kept up the landscape, at one point using it as a golf course, despite the failure of the shoe factory in 1891.In 1901, the property was reunified under the ownership of William Nelson Jr. (1829 - 1905), who had previously purchased the southern half when Judge Nelson (to whom he was not related) died in 1881, bought Howells' half following the shoe heir's bankruptcy. Nelson, who for the latter half of the 1800s, ran the Red Ball Line shipping company founded by his father, William Nelson Sr. in the 1820s, lived in the former boardinghouse with his family. He bequeathed it to his wife Marie Christiana Nelson (1860 - 1932), and she in turn passed it on to their children, Gerald, Geraldine, and Gertrude.The two daughters and son kept the property in the family after Marie Christiana passed on, with the daughters, Geraldine and Gertrude, living out most of their lives there. Gertrude Nelson Fitzpatrick and her husband lived in the cottage, while her sister Geraldine Acker and her husband Earnest R. Acker built a house for themselves in 1929 on the site where Downing had intended for Springside's main house, calling the new house 'Spring Gables'.Late 20th-century preservationThe combination of private ownership and benign neglect had preserved much of Downing and Vassar's original design for a century. This situation would change as Poughkeepsie experienced rapid growth in the years after World War II.In 1952 development pressure began when the Poughkeepsie City School District considered Springside as a site for a new high school. In the 1960s, historic preservation efforts started in response to increasing development in the area led to the estate being declared a National Historic Landmark (NHL) in 1969. The NHL designation could not protect the barn complex from being totally destroyed by arson later that month, and the other buildings suffered from continued decay and neglect. Development threats continued as the landowner, developer Robert Ackerman, persuaded the city to rezone the property to make it more amenable to the luxury apartment complex he planned to build. He pledged to protect the gatehouse and cottage, but the landscaping would have substantially altered Downing's original design.The cottage facade was removed to an Albany warehouse by state order to preserve it in 1976; a quarter-century later it was put on display at the State Museum. Only the foundation clearing remains at the site. In 1982, a nearby condominium complex proposed nearby, and approved by the city, would have cleared most of Downing's remaining landscape. A lawsuit two years later alleging an insufficient environmental impact statement was settled in 1986 with the development of the farm portion of the property, close to Route 9 and the river, while the remaining landscape donated to a newly established non-profit organization, Springside Landscape Preservation, which continues to maintain the property. It took formal title to the land in 1990.Today, only the Carpenter Gothic gatehouse, a building not found on the original plans, survives. It has been restored to its original colors and is still used as a private residence.AestheticsDowning had become a bestselling writer by expounding on his theories of combining that which was beautiful in nature and art. The buildings at Springside, both planned and built, used consciously rustic board-and-batten siding, emphasized by some of the thousand trees he had transplanted from nearby forests. On the ground, the curving pathways follow the contours of the land beneath them and lead to scenic views, sometimes created by planting evergreens around rock outcropsStatuary embellishments unite the buildings and grounds, and Downing took advantage of the property's natural drainage to create streams and fountains. Above the spring that gave the property its name, later itself named Willow Spring by Vassar, he placed a statue of a dog, since replaced by one of a young maiden. Ponds, too, were created, their irregular, natural shapes accentuated by similarly shaped islands. Many of these features that Downing pioneered were later replicated by Vaux and his fellow associate of Downing's, Frederick Law Olmsted, in their designs for Central Park and other major parks in American cities.Today, with most of the buildings no longer extant on the site, the landscape still largely reflects Downing's original plan. Some secondary vegetation has grown in, but the pathways have been restored and many of the original trees remain.See alsoEnglish Landscape Garden styleReferencesExternal linksSpringside Landmark Restoration Unofficial Springside website by a graduate student at City College of New York Springside at the Vassar College EncyclopediaNational Historic Landmarks in New York (state) Gardens in New York (state) Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in New York (state) Historic American Buildings Survey in New York (state) Landscape design history of the United States National Register of Historic Places in Poughkeepsie, New York Houses in Poughkeepsie, New York U.S. Route 9 Houses completed in 1850 Carpenter Gothic houses in New York (state) Buildings and structures in the United States destroyed by arson Arson in New York (state) Burned houses in the United States", "machine_text": "Springside is a historic estate and park located in Poughkeepsie, New York.

The area, also called La Merced, has been synonymous with commercial activity since the early colonial period when traders arrived here from other parts of New Spain. At one time, nearly the entire neighborhood was filled with market stalls and in the 1860s it was decided to build a permanent market on the grounds of the old La Merced monastery. In the first half of the 20th century, this market was the major wholesaler for the entire city. This ended when the Central de Abasto was opened in the 1980s, but La Merced remains the largest traditional retail market. The market area is also known for flagrant prostitution in which women can be seen soliciting at all hours of the day and night. It is estimated that about one third of these prostitutes are underage.Location La Merced is located east of the main plaza or Zocalo in several very large buildings, and is the city's largest traditional retail market. Metro La Merced has openings both just outside the market and inside one of the buildings. Outside the buildings, the unofficial market or “tianguis” continues on the sidewalks and streets between this market and the Zocalo. This kind of commerce is illegal, but laws against it are only intermittently enforced as unemployment is high, and peddlers pay bribes to local bosses who in turn pay bribes to local officials. This means that both inside and outside the market, pedestrian traffic jams are frequent, making pushing and shoving necessary and socially acceptable. The market area also generates about 450 tons of trash daily.HistoryThe name La Merced is synonymous with commerce in the city. The market and neighborhood is located on the far eastern side of the original layout of Mexico City after the Conquest. Here many traders arrived with wares from near and far. The market is named after the neighborhood, La Merced, which in turn was named after the monastery Nuestra Señora de la Merced de Redención de Cautivos established in 1594 and simply called the monastery of La Merced. Most of this monastery has since disappeared, leaving only its cloister with its Plateresque decoration. The neighborhood is an old one, and stories and legends, such as the whispers of Doña Esperanza Goyeneche de Ruiz Garcia who died here. Another involves an indigenous chief who received money for being a spy for the Spaniards and was found out. It is said that when this happened, he sat still never moving until he died of sadness.By the end of the 18th century, almost the entire neighborhood was one great market, which became bigger when the markets of the Zocalo area were banished around the same time. In the 19th century, the famous Circo Orrín with the first Mexican clown Ricardo Bell of Pachuca regularly stopped near this market.In the 1860s, it was decided to put the market under a roof, and the buildings were constructed on the old monastery grounds. In 1863, the first permanent buildings were constructed. By the early 20th century La Merced was the major wholesale and retail market of Mexico City, especially for foodstuffs. It continued to be the wholesale market for the city during the post-Mexican Revolution period until about the 1960s. At that time, the Central de Abasto market was created in the south of the city to take over and modernize the wholesaling of foodstuffs, especially produce and meat. La Merced continues to be the largest retail traditional market of Mexico City for a wide variety of everyday products such as fruit, vegetables, meat, poultry, toys, clothes; flowers, candy and more.In 1988, a fireworks stand in La Merced exploded, which killed more than 60 people. In 1998, a major fire destroyed two-thirds of the main hall of the market, along with 572 stalls selling dried chili peppers, fruit, vegetables, shoes and piñatas in the early morning hours of 4 May. No one was killed or injured and the cause was suspected to be faulty wiring. It took over 100 firemen more than three hours to get the fire under control.Inside the marketThe largest building of the complex is dedicated mostly to the sale of fruits and vegetables. Other buildings sell household items such as juicers, tinware, spoons, cleaning supplies and much more. There is constant movement of people here, with many shouting out to potential customers. Work begins here in the very early morning hours and ends in the evening. The market is filled at all hours with truck drivers, sellers, buyers, butchers and cooks.Basic Mexican foodstuffs is the backbone of this markets selling Mexican spices such as epazote, chili peppers fresh and dried of just about every variety, nopals (cactus pads),pig skins fried whole, corn, and uncommon items such as wild mushrooms including a variety that look like chantrelle but denser. One of the few places to find truly authentic Oaxaca cheese in the city.Vendors can be seen tying stacks of banana leaves, cutting spines from nopals, and selling “secret” herbal remedies.La Merced, like most Mexican traditional markets, is a favored place to eat Mexican street food, called “antojitos” (lit. cravings). Two specialties here are quesadillas and tostadas. Quesadillas can be had with a variety of fillings along with the cheese (typically Oaxaca cheese) such as stewed pork stomach, pickled pork fat, huitlacoche (corn fungus) and squash flowers. The quesadillas sold here are typically long and cooked on a comal, often from blue corn dough. It is topped with red or green chili peppers that have been blended with onions and salt into a watery paste. Like the quesadillas, tostadas have a wide variety of toppings and the crunchy tortilla sometimes has unusual flavorings such as sesame seeds and chipotle.Prostitution Merced is considered to be a “tolerance zone” for prostitution, meaning that police generally do not intervene.Prostitution exists in just about all parts of Mexico City but it is most obvious here. At almost any hour of the day, scantily clad women can be seen walking around. Many of these prostitutes are underage. Prices can be as low as US15 for an “encuentro” (encounter). Many small hotels are near here, some of which charge as little as 30 pesos for an hour or about 200 for a night. Many of the customers are truck drivers who have time while their vehicles are being unloaded at the market. In 2007-2008 several prostitutes were murdered. Nearly all of the murders have gone unpunished. It is estimated about one third of prostitutes here are underage. Bribes to officials to keep the industry running are estimated to be about US450,000 a year.ReferencesRetail markets in Mexico City Cuauhtémoc, Mexico City Red-light districts in Mexico Historic center of Mexico City", "machine_text": "La Merced Market is one of the largest traditional markets in Mexico City, located in the La Merced neighborhood near the historic center.

It was established in the wake of World War I to expand the Congregation's resources beyond Germany. To this day, the monastery continues to procure funds and send personnel to Benedictine missions in the Global South. The current superior of the monastic community is Fr Adelrich Staub, Prior Administrator.History Andreas Amrhein, the founder of the Missionary Benedictines, himself grew up in Switzerland, where support of the Catholic missions was widespread. Between the time Amrhein began recruiting vocations and the outbreak of World War I, twenty Swiss compatriots had joined his young mission society. The war brought about the expulsion of nearly 70 German members of the Congregation from German East Africa, illustrating the drawbacks of having too great a focus on personnel from one country. To continue mission work, Archabbot Norbert Weber decided that it was necessary for the Missionary Benedictines to expand into non-mission lands.On September 16, 1919, Fr Adelrich Mühlebach, a Swiss citizen and member of the Congregation, opened a mission procure in Uznach, near the eastern shores of Lake Zürich, 50 km from Zürich. Following negotiations with the British government, which now controlled what had been German East Africa, this new foundation was recognized as the 'Swiss Benedictine Father'. This permission allowed the Missionary Benedictines to replace some of the German members who had been expelled from Tanganyika.For the next decades, Uznach acted primarily as a mission procure, rather than a true Benedictine monastery. The Congregation decided that a true monastic spirit should be fostered there, and in 1963, the community constructed a new monastery, dedicated to St Otmar. However, Swiss law prevented the foundation of monasteries, so the foundation remained a priory until the repeal of the relevant law in 1973. On January 6, 1982, the Congregation elevated the monastery to the status of an abbey, and Fr Ivo Auf der Maur became the first Abbot of Uznach. A new church was consecrated in 1988.Apostolate While maintaining the lifestyle of Benedictine monks, the abbey's community continues the important work of procuring funds for the Congregation's international missions. This includes the publication of a mission periodical, which is regularly distributed to the abbey's thousands of benefactors.Pastoral work is also a key part of the abbey's apostolate. Many of the priests help in parishes, and provide spiritual guidance to religious communities, the sick, and the elderly. Additionally, the monastery also hosts retreats and provides catechetical instruction.The Abbey of Uznach continues to send a large number of brothers and priests to the missions of the Congregation.DependenciesFribourg: A house at Fribourg, known as the 'Benedictinum', was in existence from 1937 to 1963. Due to Nazi actions against the Catholic Church, it was thought prudent to found a study house in a neutral state to provide for the formation of German and Swiss clerics. Raised to the status of a conventual priory in 1947, the Fribourg house was in fact the monastic center of the Swiss community, while Uznach continued to act as procure. However, staffing both Fribourg and Uznach was a strain on monastic community. Fribourg was abandoned in order to develop Uznach into a genuine monastery. Osornoe, Kazakhstan: Our Lady of the Plentiful Catch Monastery was erected in Osornoe on September 29, 2006. The monastery is located in the Archdiocese of Maria Santissima in Astana. Fr Joseph Schnider is the superior of the small community that resides there.Personnel As of May 18, 2011, the monastic community of Uznach included twenty monks in perpetual vows, around half of them ordained.

It was founded in the early 11th century by the Counts of Toggenburg and dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul. The abbey was known for its influential and prominent abbots, who played significant roles in the political and cultural history of the region. Notably, Abbot Ulrich Rösch, who served from 1501 to 1525, was a renowned humanist and bibliophile. In its heyday, Uznach Abbey was a major center of religious, cultural, and economic activity. It possessed extensive lands, and its monks engaged in agriculture, viticulture, and the production of textiles, pottery, and other goods. The monastery also had a renowned scriptorium, producing illuminated manuscripts of exceptional quality. The abbey declined in the 16th century due to natural disasters and the advent of the Protestant Reformation. It was dissolved in 1848 during the secularization of Switzerland, and its buildings and lands were sold off. Today, little remains of the original abbey complex, as most of the buildings were destroyed or repurposed over the centuries. However, the former monastery church, which dates to the 12th century, still stands and is now used as the parish church of Uznach. The church features several notable elements, including a Romanesque portico, Gothic choir stalls, and a Baroque high altar.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Adult/Child\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Adult/Child (sometimes typeset as Adult Child) is an unreleased studio album by American rock band the Beach Boys, intended to follow the group's 1977 The Beach Boys Love You. Like The Beach Boys Love You, it is virtually a Brian Wilson solo project with other group members serving mainly as additional vocalists. After it was rejected by Reprise Records, the band released the 1978 M.I.U. Album in its place with an almost entirely revamped song list. A few projected tracks for Adult Child were eventually released on later albums and compilations. Currently, the album is available only as a bootleg recording.Stylus Magazine tersely summarizes the work: 'Brian’s Sinatra album. Vegas big band arrangements, brassy cover tunes, a few songs written with the hopes that the Chairman himself might sing them. The label heard it and probably rejected it before track 2 began.' Amid its status as an esoteric non-release within the Beach Boys catalog, the album has developed a mild cult following among fans and musicians.BackgroundIn 1977, plans were made for a Beach Boys album composed entirely of outtakes recorded during 1976 sessions for 15 Big Ones (1976) and The Beach Boys Love You (1977) partnered with material originating as far back as 1965. After the release of Love You, the Beach Boys fell into dispute over the direction of the band, and were close to breaking up. Intended as a follow-up to Love You, sessions and mixing for a new album entitled Adult Child were completed by the Beach Boys with Brian Wilson acting as producer.Similarly with 'Good Time' on The Beach Boys Love You, a few Adult Child tracks were outtakes sourced from earlier Beach Boys albums. Sessions for the album were kickstarted on January 19, 1977, only five days after the assembly for Love You was completed. Concurrently, Dennis Wilson worked on his solo album Pacific Ocean Blue which would see release in September 1977. According to Stan Love, the band's manager and younger brother of the Beach Boys' Mike Love, when Mike heard the rough demo recordings of Adult/Child replete with big band swing arrangements, he turned to Brian and asked: 'What the fuck are you doing?' While projected for release in autumn 1977, the album was rejected by Reprise Records for not being commercially viable.Music and lyricsBrian composes, writes, and sings most of Adult/Child with Carl and Dennis Wilson swapping lead vocals. Exceptionally, Brian included the group's cover versions of 'Deep Purple', 'On Broadway', and the traditional folk standard 'Shortenin' Bread', the last of which he had been obsessed with for several years. Dick Reynolds was commissioned for the arrangement of four tracks. Reynolds had arranged strings for The Beach Boys' Christmas Album, and for Brian's idols the Four Freshmen and Frank Sinatra in 1964.The album's lyrics mostly reflect the minutiae of Brian's life during the 1970s. Some songs center around physical fitness, eating healthy, and ecology. Describing 'Hey Little Tomboy', a leftover from Love You, Brian said, 'It's about a little girl who is sort of a rough neck, and this guy convinces her to become a pretty girl, and sure enough she slowly turns into a pretty—she starts shaving her legs and wearing short sticks—puts lipstick on and makeup. So she's a little tomboy. ... We're very happy with it.' Biographer Peter Ames Carlin wrote that '[the song] reveled uncomfortably in an adolescent girl who is putting away her skateboard and baseball mitt in order to get hot and heavy with the swain portrayed by Mike. ... [it] may be the most unsettling moment in the entire recorded history of the Beach Boys.'In line with the group's two previous albums, it was also slated to include a couple of older outtakes: 'H.E.L.P. Is On the Way' from the Surf's Up sessions and 'Games Two Can Play' from the Sunflower sessions.Availability The album has been released through numerous bootlegs, but is officially unavailable. 'Hey Little Tomboy' appears in a slightly revised form on M.I.U. Album. 'Shortenin' Bread', a traditional folk song with which Brian was reportedly obsessed at the time, was revised and placed on L.A. (Light Album) (1979). 'H.E.L.P. Is On the Way,' 'Games Two Can Play,' 'It's Over Now,' and 'Still I Dream of It' were released on the group's box set Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys (1993). An alternate piano demo of 'Still I Dream of It' was included on Brian Wilson's solo album I Just Wasn't Made for These Times (1995).ReceptionMusicologist Philip Lambert believes, 'All of the songs from this collection are solid efforts, but 'Still I Dream of It' and 'It's Over Now' are particularly inspired and rank right up there with Brian's best work,' calling them 'gut-wrenching ballads about romance and heartbreak.' Scram—a fanzine devoted to esoteric works—said: 'There are so-called Beach Boys fans who say anybody who applaud Love You and this album is being ironic. I say fuck those tight-arsed naysayers! Both of those albums showcase a truly original mix of humor and sadness. The original numbers always dance just a step away from the cliche, dealing with simple lyrical themes that make you wonder why they had never been explored before.' Stylus Magazine included the album in a list entitled ''Long Time Gone' – The Classic Rock Lost Album Archetypes' among other Beach Boys' non-releases such as Smile, Landlocked, and Bambu as 'A Lost Album Category Unto Themselves'. The journal wrote: quote|'If 'legend' means 'an unreleased masterwork from the genius who brought us Pet Sounds”' then no. But for Brian fanatics, Adult Child is a must-hear, even if it does chronicle the decline of what was arguably pop’s greatest talent ... nearly every song reflects the sorry state in which the elder-Wilson found himself by the late-Seventies: a drug-addled, paranoid shut-in, weighing in at a none-too-svelte 300 lbs. As morbidly awful as that proposition sounds, however, Wilson’s melodic sense, arranging skills and humor had not yet totally abandoned him by 1977 — even if his choirboy voice, ravaged by a four-pack-a-day cigarette habit, had.'In 2000, a cover of 'Lines' was recorded by Duglas T. Stewart of indie pop band BMX Bandits for the various artists tribute album Caroline Now!. BMX Bandits recorded a version of 'Hey Little Tomboy' with Pearlfishers. 'Still I Dream of It' has been covered by Ed Harcourt, Jimmy Nail, and Carice van Houten.

It can be characterized by the level of emotional bonding, love, care, respect, and trust between the two parties. The adult/child relationship is crucial to the development of a child's social, emotional, and cognitive skills. In most cultures, parents are seen as role models for their children and they provide guidelines, values, and boundaries for their child's behavior. The quality of the relationship, however, can have varying effects on the child's development. Positive parent-child relationships have been linked to better academic performance, social adjustment, and emotional well-being. Negative parent-child relationships, on the other hand, can lead to developmental challenges such as anxiety, depression, aggression, and poor academic performance. Factors that contribute to building strong adult/child relationships include effective communication, support, mutual respect, and setting appropriate boundaries. Positive parenting techniques such as praising good behavior and providing constructive criticism when necessary can foster positive relationships. Spending quality time together, giving undivided attention, and engaging in joint decision-making can also improve the bond. The adult/child relationship is not static and can change over time due to various factors such as the child's age, life events, and cultural differences. Adolescence, for example, is a time where the parent-child relationship undergoes significant changes due to the child's increased need for independence and autonomy.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Tracy Jordan\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Tracy Jordan is a fictional character in the American television series 30 Rock, played by the actor Tracy Morgan. The character is a movie star whose personality traits and life events are taken from Morgan's own life. In 2010, Entertainment Weekly ranked him the 55th Greatest Character of the Last 20 Years.For his portrayal of Jordan, Tracy Morgan has received one Primetime Emmy Award nomination, two Image Awards nominations, and seven Screen Actors Guild Award nominations, winning one.Concept Tracy Jordan is a rich, famous B-list movie star with a reputation for unpredictable behavior. At the time newly installed NBC executive Jack Donaghy forces writer Liz Lemon to hire Jordan as the new star of her sketch comedy program The Girlie Show in the pilot episode of the series, Jordan was in a career slump, having made no new movies for two years. Upon hiring Tracy, Jack renames the show TGS with Tracy Jordan, much to the chagrin of Liz. Throughout the series, Jordan enjoys renewed success through his starring TGS role and other performances and ventures.Character history Jordan is a descendant of Thomas Jefferson and slave Sally Hemings. Jordan was born in Yankee Stadium but the exact date is unknown as he has no birth certificate. He was given the honorary birthday of February 24, shared with TGS Co-star Jenna Maroney in the March 5, 2009 episode 'Goodbye, My Friend'. Tracy grew up in a tough neighborhood in The Bronx called ‘Knuckle Beach’, though many of his claims about it sound fictitious. As a child, Jordan was a cast member on the Nickelodeon show Ray Ray's Mystery Garage. He also claims to have attended middle school in an Exxon station. He lived with his single mother in 1979, dropped out of Frank Lucas High School over his inability to dissect a frog, and claims to have spent time busking as a bucket drummer. He was discovered after doing stand-up at the Apollo in 1984. Jordan did a Christmas album in 1998 and is a big fan of Pat Benatar. In addition to his acting career, he writes a column in Ebony Magazine called 'Musings'. He owns several houses but got into debt because he didn't make the payments on them.Character traits Jordan is a self-centered prima donna. For instance, in 'Operation Righteous Cowboy Lightning', Tracy says, 'Perfection is my middle name. 'Unclaimed Perfection Baby Boy'.' He aspires to own an island. Jordan is treated for a mental health disorder by Dr. Leo Spaceman, a doctor of questionable integrity and qualification, who describes Tracy's problems as 'erratic tendencies and delusions brought on by excessive notoriety and certainly not helped by my (Spaceman's) highly experimental treatments.' He is unable to perform a scene the same way twice ('Future Husband'), making his employ as an actor difficult. Jordan is also a conspiracy theorist who believes, for instance, in shadow organizations and vampires.Despite all this, the character is supposed to be generally well-meaning and more intelligent than he appears. He periodically surprises his coworkers with his knowledge of proper grammar (for example, telling Toofer in 'The Aftermath' that 'Superman does good, you're doing well') and advanced vocabulary, though these vignettes are often played for comedy. He is able to remember details of American history and is able to answer trivia questions correctly. He also has a sensitivity to the mistreatment of African Americans. Tracy has an interest in American Revolutionary history, which he studied after learning of his relation to Thomas Jefferson, attempting to produce and star in a Jefferson biopic. In 'Corporate Crush', while struggling to secure funding for his film, he tells Liz 'You're my Alexander Hamilton!' In 'Winter Madness' he argues with several Freedom Trail historical reenactors in Boston for misrepresenting the racism of the Founding Fathers and the date of Crispus Attucks' death.Jordan often implies that his clownish behavior is mostly an act, which he maintains because his childish persona is responsible for his success as an entertainer. This seems to be supported by Jordan's occasional moments of maturity, such as when he behaves professionally for an entire week in 'The Natural Order' to prove to Liz Lemon that he is capable of acting like an adult. However, he soon reverts to his old personality, admitting he is more comfortable being immature.RelationshipsFamily Tracy and his wife Angie have been married since 1991. They like to roleplay, including 'playing rape', when he wears a ski mask. Jordan often walks around his house naked to show his oldest male child 'who got the biggest ding-dong'. With Angie, Tracy has two sons, named Tracy Jordan Jr. and George Foreman Jordan (played by Dante E. Clark), and a daughter, Virginia, who is born during season 5. Tracy also has a self-styled illegitimate son named Donald (played by Michael Benjamin Washington), an entrepreneur whom Tracy supports financially despite knowing that he is not actually his son; Donald is two years older than Tracy.Although he 'parties with women to keep up his rap credentials,' Tracy maintains loyalty to his wife, admitting to Jack Donaghy in 'The Ones' that he has never cheated on her. Because his womanizing persona is integral to his success as an entertainer, Tracy's career takes a downturn in 'Don Geiss, America, and Hope' when his monogamy becomes known to the public, in a reverse parody of the Tiger Woods infidelity scandal of 2009.Tracy spent most of his childhood in foster care. He once lived with his birth mother, but lost touch with her: in 'The Moms' he is not sure of her whereabouts or even her name. Tracy's biological father is unknown; Tracy presumes him dead since he has never come forward to ask Tracy for money. In 'Nothing Left to Lose,' Tracy shares memories of a father who abandoned him for a second family in Ohio (going on to have a daughter who is also named Tracy), but the effect of this upon the show's continuity is unclear.With Liz Tracy refers to Liz by either her last name or her full name, for example, 'Too late, Liz Lemon!' Jordan treats Liz with contempt and mimics her. However, in later seasons he begins calling her 'LL', following a trend of often calling characters by their initials.With his entourage and friends Jordan tends to loiter around the studio with his entourage, former high school classmate Grizz and professional entourage member Dot Com.Jordan develops a close friendship with NBC page Kenneth Parcell, who willingly runs errands for him and periodically serves as a member of his entourage.Kenneth often puts himself in harm's way to help Jordan.Jordan helps Kenneth with his shyness around women, and considers himself a mentor to Kenneth.He is more sympathetic to Kenneth than most of the other characters are.For example, when Tracy quit TGS after learning he no longer needed the money he earned from the show, it was Jack's threat to fire Kenneth that made Tracy change his mind, returning to the show in order to keep Kenneth employed ('The Bubble').Kenneth acted as an asexual, de facto, on-set wife to Jordan during his brief estrangement from Angie (Season 2).With Jenna Jordan and Jenna often disagree. For instance, whether it is more difficult to be a black man or a white woman in America ('Believe in the Stars'). However, they have some friendly moments at times and become closer, assuming they are both 'special people'.There is also an increasing occurrence of the two being involved in shenanigans together.Jordan's lifeCareer Jordan has a reputation for being uncontrollable and his habit of insulting powerful movie executives costs him roles. However, Jordan's engagements are many and varied.Politics Jordan is not overly interested in politics. Jack tried to recruit Jordan to join the Republican Party, but Jordan came to realize that African-Americans would never support the GOP. In 2007 Tracy's wife objects to him playing Barack Obama because, '...we support [Dennis] Kucinich.' In the 2008 US Presidential Election, Jordan voted for Ralph Nader.Religion Jordan is not religious. He once considers becoming Catholic, but is dissuaded by Jack due to, as expected, intolerance of guilt. In 'The Ones,' when Jordan arranges for Jack to come clubbing with him to see if Jack can remain faithful to his fiancée Elisa, Jordan compares the temptation to 'Jesus in the wilderness,' before clarifying that Jesus is the name of a person he knows and 'the Wilderness' is a club they'd attended. Jordan once wrote a novelty song entitled 'Werewolf Bar Mitzvah', which he recorded for Geffen Records. The lyrics include 'Werewolf bar mitzvah, spooky, scary! Boys becoming men; men becoming wolves!' He learns some Hebrew phrases. In the first episode of season 4 (entitled Season Four) of the show, it is revealed that Tracy may as well actually be Jewish. When asked about his disconnection to his roots, he said, 'Have I lost touch with my roots? I've gotta talk to Rabbi Shmuley about this.'Finances Despite his personality difficulties, Jordan succeeds financially. For example, he makes 300 million by creating and marketing a pornographic video game, and then invests the profits in a company that dismantles bank signs during the financial crisis.DeathIn Episode 21 of Season Five, it is revealed in an end credit scene that both Jordan and Maroney died on March 17, 2016 of an unknown cause. This has been proven to be false in the events of '30 Rock: A One-Time Special' which is set in July 2020 and Tracy and Jenna have both been shown to be alive with the former living in Canada.Trivia In Tina Fey's original pilot script for 30 Rock, Jordan was called 'Lawrence Jordan'.ReferencesExternal links30 Rock characters Fictional actors Fictional African-American people Fictional comedians Fictional criminals Fictional characters from New York City Television characters introduced in 2006 Fictional television personalities Narcissism in television American male characters in television", "machine_text": "Tracy Jordan is a fictional character on the television show '30 Rock'.

She was used by the Union Navy as a ship's tender in support of the Union Navy blockade of Confederate waterways.Albermarle and Lion seized by Union Navy forcesOn the morning of 26 March 1862, sidewheel gunboat Delaware—during an expedition to the Pungo River in Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, in search of Confederate shipping reported to be there—entered Pantego Creek and found two large schooners at its head . . . 'which,' he reported, 'proved to be the Albemarle and Lion owned by Boyle and Richard Reddick, of Suffolk, Virginia.'Two armed boats from the Union warship took possession of the Southern vessels, towed them down stream, and anchored them at the mouth of the creek. Early the next morning, Delaware received on board several families who professed loyalty to the Union and asked for protection. Later that day, the gunboat and its prizes then proceeded to New Bern, North Carolina.Assigned as a store ship for Union Navy blockade shipsLittle information of the prizes' movements during ensuing months seems to have survived, but Albemarle apparently remained in the North Carolina sounds. In any case, she and a schooner named Knockern were reported on 3 February 1863 to be off New Bern serving as storeships for Union forces in the sounds. On 4 May 1863, a report from Rear Admiral Samuel Phillips Lee to Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles stated that Albemarle was still there performing in the same capacity.North Carolina support operationsOnly five days later, the Union Navy purchased the schooner from the New York City prize court. The fact that the schooner was serving as a storeship in the sounds during the ensuing summer strongly suggests that she never left North Carolina waters but was condemned in absentia. In any case, Albemarle—commanded by Acting Assistant Paymaster Emanuel Mellach until early spring 1865 and then by Acting Assistant Paymaster George R. Watkins—served in North Carolina waters as a storeship and an ordnance hulk through the end of the Civil War.Post-war decommissioning and saleLate in July 1865, she was towed to Hampton Roads, Virginia, and sold at public auction in the Norfolk Navy Yard on 19 October 1865 to a Capt.

The ship was named after Albemarle Sound in North Carolina. The Albemarle was built in George Thomas' shipyard in North Carolina in 1863 and was launched in April of that same year. She was one of the first ironclad vessels in the Union Navy, and the first of her kind in the western rivers. The ship was armed with two 6.4-inch guns and a ram on her bow, and was protected by heavy iron plating. She had a crew of 121 men and was commanded by Charles W. Flusser. The Albemarle played an important role in the Union Navy's operations in the western rivers during the latter years of the Civil War. She was involved in many engagements, including the battle of Elizabeth City in February 1862, where she played a key role in the Union victory. Despite her successes, the Albemarle was sunk in October 1864 by a daring raid carried out by Lieutenant William B. Cushing. Cushing and his men took a small boat up the Roanoke River and successfully blew up the Albemarle using a torpedo. The sinking of the Albemarle was a major victory for the Union Navy, and helped to secure control of the western rivers for the remainder of the war.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Maurice Maeterlinck\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Maurice Polydore Marie Bernard Maeterlinck (29 August 1862 – 6 May 1949), also known as Count (or Comte) Maeterlinck from 1932, was a Belgian playwright, poet, and essayist who was Flemish but wrote in French. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1911 'in appreciation of his many-sided literary activities, and especially of his dramatic works, which are distinguished by a wealth of imagination and by a poetic fancy, which reveals, sometimes in the guise of a fairy tale, a deep inspiration, while in a mysterious way they appeal to the readers' own feelings and stimulate their imaginations'. The main themes in his work are death and the meaning of life. He was a leading member of La Jeune Belgique group and his plays form an important part of the Symbolist movement. In later life, Maeterlinck faced credible accusations of plagiarism.BiographyEarly life Maeterlinck was born in Ghent, Belgium, to a wealthy, French-speaking family. His mother, Mathilde Colette Françoise (née Van den Bossche), came from a wealthy family. His father, Polydore, was a notary who enjoyed tending the greenhouses on their property.In September 1874 he was sent to the Jesuit College of Sainte-Barbe, where works of the French Romantics were scorned and only plays on religious subjects were permitted. His experiences at this school influenced his distaste for the Catholic Church and organized religion. One of his companions at that time was the writer Charles van Lerberghe, the poems and plays of whom went on to act as mutual influences on each other at the start of the Symbolist period.Maeterlinck had written poems and short novels while still studying, but his father wanted him to go into law. After gaining a law degree at the University of Ghent in 1885, he spent a few months in Paris, France. He met members of the new Symbolist movement; Villiers de l'Isle Adam in particular, who would have a great influence on Maeterlinck's subsequent work.CareerMaeterlinck instantly became a public figure when his first play, Princess Maleine, received enthusiastic praise from Octave Mirbeau, the literary critic of Le Figaro, in August 1890. In the following years he wrote a series of symbolist plays characterized by fatalism and mysticism, most importantly Intruder (1890), The Blind (1890) and Pelléas and Mélisande (1892).He had a relationship with the singer and actress Georgette Leblanc from 1895 until 1918. Leblanc influenced his work for the following two decades. With the play Aglavaine and Sélysette (1896) Maeterlinck began to create characters, especially female characters, who were more in control of their destinies. Leblanc performed these female characters on stage. Even though mysticism and metaphysics influenced his work throughout his career, Maeterlinck slowly replaced his Symbolism with a more existential style.In 1895, with his parents frowning upon his open relationship with an actress, Maeterlinck and Leblanc moved to the district of Passy in Paris. The Catholic Church was unwilling to grant her a divorce from her Spanish husband. The couple frequently entertained guests, including Mirbeau, Jean Lorrain, and Paul Fort. They spent their summers in Normandy. During this period, Maeterlinck published his Twelve Songs (1896), The Treasure of the Humble (1896), The Life of the Bee (1901), and Ariadne and Bluebeard (1902).In 1903 Maeterlinck received the Triennial Prize for Dramatic Literature from the Belgian government. During this period, and up until the Great War of 1914-1918, he was widely looked up to, throughout Europe, as a great sage, and the embodiment of the higher thought of the time.In 1906 Maeterlinck and Leblanc moved to a villa in Grasse in the south of France. He spent his hours meditating and walking. As he emotionally pulled away from Leblanc, he entered a state of depression. Diagnosed with neurasthenia, he rented theBenedictine Abbey of St. Wandrille in Normandy to help him relax. By renting the abbey he rescued it from the desecration of being sold and used as a chemical factory and thus he received a blessing from the Pope. Leblanc would often walk around in the garb of an abbess; he would wear roller skates as he moved about the house. During this time, he wrote his essay 'The Intelligence of Flowers' (1906), in which he expressed sympathy with socialist ideas. He donated money to many workers' unions and socialist groups. At this time he conceived his greatest contemporary success: the fairy playThe Blue Bird (1908, but largely written in 1906). After the writing 'The Intelligence of Flowers', he suffered from a period of depression and writer's block. Although he recovered from this after a year or two, he never became so inventive as a writer again. His later plays, such as Marie-Victoire (1907) andMary Magdalene (1910), provided with lead roles for Leblanc, were notably inferior to their predecessors, and sometimes merely repeat an earlier formula. Even though alfresco performances of some of his plays at St. Wandrille had been successful, Maeterlinck felt that he was losing his privacy. The death of his mother on 11 June 1910 added to his depression.In 1910 he met the 18-year-old actress Renée Dahon during a rehearsal of The Blue Bird. She became his lighthearted companion. After having been nominated by Carl Bildt, a member of the Swedish Academy, he received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1911, which also served to lighten his spirits. By 1913 he had become more openly socialist and sided with the Belgian trade unions against the Catholic party during a strike. He began to study mysticism and lambasted the Catholic Church in his essays for misconstruing the history of the universe. By a decree of 26 January 1914, the Roman Catholic Church placed his opera omnia on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum.When Germany invaded Belgium in 1914, Maeterlinck wished to join the French Foreign Legion, but his application was denied due to his age. He and Leblanc decided to leave Grasse for a villa near Nice, where he spent the next decade of his life. He gave speeches on the bravery of the Belgian people and placed the blame upon all Germans for the war. Although his patriotism and his indifference to the harm he was doing to his standing in Germany do him credit, his reputation as a great sage who stood above current affairs was damaged by his political involvement.While in Nice he wrote The Mayor of Stilmonde (1918), which the American press quickly labeled a 'Great War Play', and which became a British film in 1929. He also wrote The Betrothal (, 1922), a sequel to The Blue Bird, in which the heroine of the play is clearly not a Leblanc archetype.On 15 February 1919 Maeterlinck married Dahon. He accepted an invitation to the United States, where Samuel Goldwyn asked him to produce a few scenarios for film. Only two of Maeterlinck's submissions still exist; Goldwyn didn't use any of them. Maeterlinck had prepared one based on his The Life of the Bee. After reading the first few pages Goldwyn burst out of his office, exclaiming: 'My God! The hero is a bee!'After 1920 Maeterlinck ceased to contribute significantly to the theatre, but continued to produce essays on his favourite themes of occultism, ethics and natural history. The international demand for these fell off sharply after the early 1920s, but his sales in France remained substantial until the late 1930s. Dahon gave birth to a stillborn child in 1925.Plagiarism In 1926 Maeterlinck published La Vie des Termites (translated into English as The Life of Termites or The Life ofWhite Ants), an entomological book that plagiarised the book The Soul of the (White) Ant, by the Afrikaner poet and scientist Eugène Marais, David Bignell, in his inaugural address as Professor of Zoology at the University of London (2003), called Maeterlinck's work 'a classic example of academic plagiarism'. Marais accused Maeterlinck of having appropriated Marais' concept of the 'organic unity' of the termite nest in his book. Marais had published his ideas on termite nests in the South African Afrikaans-language press, in Die Burger (January 1923) and in Huisgenoot, which featured a series of articles on termites under the title 'Die Siel van die Mier' (The Soul of the (White) Ant) from 1925 to 1926. Maeterlinck's book, with almost identical content, was published in 1926. It is conjectured that Maeterlinck had come across Marais' articles while writing his book, and that it would have been easy for him to translate Afrikaans into French, since Maeterlinck knew Dutch and had already made several translations from Dutch into French.It was common at the time, moreover, for worthy articles published in Afrikaans to be reproduced in Flemish and Dutch magazines and journals.Marais wrote in a letter to Dr. Winifred de Kock in London about Maeterlinck thatThe famous author had paid me the left-handed compliment of cribbing the most important part of my work ... He clearly desired his readers to infer that he had arrived at certain of my theories (the result of ten years of hard labour in the veld) by his own unaided reason, although he admits that he never saw a termite in his life. You must understand that it was not merely plagiarism of the spirit of a thing, so to speak. He has copied page after page verbally.Supported by a coterie of Afrikaner Nationalist friends, Marais sought justice through the South African press and attempted an international lawsuit. This was to prove financially impossible and the case was not pursued. All the same, he gained a measure of renown as the aggrieved party and as an Afrikaner researcher who had opened himself up to plagiarism because he published in Afrikaans out of nationalistic loyalty. Marais brooded at the time of the scandal: 'I wonder whether Maeterlinck blushes when he reads such things [critical acclaim], and whether he gives a thought to the injustice he does to the unknown Boer worker?'Maeterlinck's own words in The Life of Termites indicate that the possible discovery or accusation of plagiarism worried him:It would have been easy, in regard to every statement, to allow the text to bristle with footnotes and references. In some chapters there is not a sentence but would have clamoured for these; and the letterpress would have been swallowed up by vast masses of comment, like one of those dreadful books we hated so much at school. There is a short bibliography at the end of the volume which will no doubt serve the same purpose.Whatever Maeterlinck's misgivings at the time of writing, the bibliography he refers to does not include Eugène Marais.Professor V. E. d'Assonville referred to Maeterlinck as 'the Nobel Prize winner who had never seen a termite in his whole life and had never put a foot on the soil of Africa, least of all in the Waterberg'.Robert Ardrey, an admirer of Eugène Marais, attributed Marais' later suicide to this act of plagiarism and theft of intellectual property by Maeterlinck, although Marais' biographer, Leon Rousseau, suggested that Marais had enjoyed and even thrived on the controversy the attention it generated.Another allegation of plagiarism concerned Maeterlinck's play Monna Vanna, which was said to have been based on Robert Browning's little-known play Luria.Later life In 1930 he bought a château in Nice, France, and named it Orlamonde, a name occurring in his work Quinze Chansons.He was made a count by Albert I, King of the Belgians in 1932.According to an article published in the New York Times in 1940, he arrived in the United States from Lisbon on the Greek Liner Nea Hellas. He had fled to Lisbon in order to escape the Nazi invasion of both Belgium and France. While in Portugal, he stayed in Monte Estoril, at the Grande Hotel, between 27 July and 17 August 1939. The Times quoted him as saying, 'I knew that if I was captured by the Germans I would be shot at once, since I have always been counted as an enemy of Germany because of my play, The Mayor of Stilmonde, which dealt with the conditions in Belgium during the German Occupation of 1918.' As with his earlier visit to America, he still found Americans too casual, friendly and Francophilic for his taste.He returned to Nice after the war on 10 August 1947. He was President of PEN International, the worldwide association of writers, from 1947 until 1949. In 1948, the French Academy awarded him the Medal for the French Language. He died in Nice on 6 May 1949 after suffering a heart attack.Honours1920: Grand Cordon of the Order of Leopold.1932: Created Count Maeterlinck, by Royal Decree. However, he neglected fulfilling the necessary paper work for registration and the creation was not implemented.Static dramaMaeterlinck's posthumous reputation depends entirely on his early plays (published between 1889 and 1894), which created a new style of dialogue, extremely lean and spare, where what is suggested is more important than what is said. The characters have no foresight, and only a limited understanding of themselves or the world around them. That the characters stumble into tragedy without realizing where they are going may suggest that Maeterlinck thought of man as powerless against the forces of fate, but the kinship is not with ancient Greek tragedy but with modern dramatists such as Beckett and Pinter who bring out human vulnerability in a world beyond our comprehension.Maeterlinck believed that any actor, due to the hindrance of physical mannerisms and expressions, would inadequately portray the symbolic figures of his plays. He concluded that marionettes were an excellent alternative. Guided by strings operated by a puppeteer, Maeterlinck considered marionettes an excellent representation of fate's complete control over man. He wrote Interior, The Death of Tintagiles, and Alladine and Palomides for marionette theatre.From this, he gradually developed his notion of the 'static drama.' He felt that it was the artist's responsibility to create something that did not express human emotions but rather the external forces that compel people. Maeterlinck once wrote that 'the stage is a place where works of art are extinguished. ... Poems die when living people get into them.'He explained his ideas on the static drama in his essay 'The Tragic in Daily Life' (1896), which appeared in The Treasure of the Humble. The actors were to speak and move as if pushed and pulled by an external force, fate as puppeteer. They were not to allow the stress of their inner emotions to compel their movements. Maeterlinck would often continue to refer to his cast of characters as 'marionettes.'Maeterlinck's conception of modern tragedy rejects the intrigue and vivid external action of traditional drama in favour of a dramatisation of different aspects of life:He cites a number of classical Athenian tragedies—which, he argues, are almost motionless and which diminish psychological action to pursue an interest in 'the individual, face to face with the universe'—as precedents for his conception of static drama; these include most of the works of Aeschylus and Sophocles' Ajax, Antigone, Oedipus at Colonus, and Philoctetes. With these plays, he claims:Maeterlinck in musicPelléas and Mélisande inspired several musical compositions at the turn of the 20th century:1897: a suite for orchestra by William Wallace: Pelleas and Melisande1898: an orchestral suite (sometimes described as incidental music) by Gabriel Fauré See: Pelléas et Mélisande (Fauré) (Op. 80)1893–1902: an opera by Claude Debussy (L. 88, Paris), see Pelléas et Mélisande (opera)1902–1903: a symphonic poem by Arnold Schoenberg (Op. 5)1905: incidental music by Jean Sibelius (Op. 46), see Pelléas et Mélisande (Sibelius)Other musical works based on Maeterlinck's plays include:Aglavaine and Sélysetteorchestral prelude by Arthur Honeggerorchestral overture by Cyril ScottAladina and Palomidopera by Burghauseropera by Osvald Chlubnaopera by Emil František BurianAriane et Barbe-bleueopera in 3 acts by Paul Dukasincidental music by Anatoly Nikolayevich AlexandrovThe Betrothalincidental music by Armstrong GibbsThe Blindopera by Beat Furrerchamber opera Ślepcy by Polish composer Jan Astriab after Maeterlinck's Les aveuglesopera by Lera AuerbachThe Death of Tintagilessymphonic poem by Charles Martin Loefflerincidental music by Ralph Vaughan Williamsopera by Lawrance Collingwoodoverture by Carseopera by Nouguessymphonic poem by Santoliquidoorchestral prelude by VoormolenHerzgewächse (Foliages of the Heart)Lied for soprano with small ensemble by Arnold SchoenbergMonna Vannaopera in 3 acts by Emil ÁbrányiMonna Vanna, opera in 4 acts by Henry FévrierMonna Vanna, unfinished opera by Sergei Rachmaninoffopera in 4 acts by Nicolae BrânzeuL'oiseau bleuopera by Albert Wolff13 scenes for orchestra by Fritz Hartincidental music by Leslie Hewardincidental music by Engelbert Humperdinckoverture by Krickaincidental music by Norman O'Neillincidental music by SzeligowskiPrincess Maleineoverture by Pierre de Brévilleoverture by Cyril Scottunfinished opera (or incidental music) by Lili Boulangerincidental music by Maximilian SteinbergThe Seven Princessesincidental music by Pierre de Brévilleopera by Vassili Vassilievitch NetchaïevSœur Beatriceopera by Alexander Grechaninovchorus by Anatoly Liadovopera Sor Beatriz by Marquez Puigopera by Dmitri Mitropoulosopera by Rasse (composer)Intérieuropera by Giedrius KuprevičiusWorksPoetrySerres chaudes (1889)Douze chansons (1896)Quinze chansons (expanded version of Douze chansons) (1900)DramaLa Princesse Maleine (Princess Maleine) (published 1889)L'Intruse (Intruder) (published 1890;

Although he is mainly known as a playwright, his impact on literature was far-ranging and his works spanned many genres including poetry, short stories, essays and criticism. Maeterlinck was born in Ghent, Belgium, but grew up in a countryside castle in Flanders. He began his career as a lawyer, but soon turned to writing, publishing his first collection of poems in 1889, titled Serres chaudes. His first play, Princess Maleine, was performed the following year to critical acclaim. Maeterlinck's most famous plays are The Intruder (1890), The Blind (1890), and Pelléas and Mélisande (1892), but he wrote over thirty plays in total. His plays were often described as symbolist, as they were characterized by a dreamlike atmosphere and complex symbolism. In his writing, he explored themes of death, the afterlife, and the mysteries of nature. Maeterlinck's work had a profound impact on the literary world and was an influence on many writers, including W.B. Yeats, Franz Kafka, and T.S. Eliot. Many of his plays were adapted into operas, including Pelléas and Mélisande, which was famously adapted by composer Claude Debussy. Maeterlinck died in Nice, France, in 1949, but his legacy lives on as one of the most influential writers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His impact on the literary world is still felt today through his contributions to the symbolist movement and his innovative exploration of language and form.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 162198}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Polyarchy\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "In political science, the term polyarchy ( 'many', arkhe 'rule') was used by Robert A. Dahl to describe a form of government in which power is invested in multiple people. It takes the form of neither a dictatorship nor a democracy. This form of government was first implemented in the United States and France and gradually adopted by other countries. According to Dahl, the fundamental democratic principle is 'the continuing responsiveness of the government to the preferences of its citizens, considered as political equals' with unimpaired opportunities. A polyarchy is a state that has certain procedures that are necessary conditions for following the democratic principle.In semblance, the word 'polycracy' describes the same form of government, although from a slightly different premise: a polycracy is a state ruled by more than one person, as opposed to a monocracy. The word derives from Greek poly ('many') and kratos ('rule' or 'strength').DefinitionsDahl's original theory of polyarchal democracy is in his 1956 book A Preface to Democratic Theory. His theory evolved over the decades, and the description in later writings is somewhat different.Dahl argues that 'democracy' is an ideal type that no country has ever achieved. For Dahl, democracy is a system that is 'completely responsive to all its citizens', and the closest to the democratic ideal any country can come is polyarchy.A Preface to Democratic TheoryIn the book, Dahl gives eight conditions that measure the extent to which majority rule is in effect in an organization. These are (p. 84):Every member of the organization performs the acts we assume to constitute an expression of preference among the scheduled alternatives, e.g., voting. In tabulating these expressions (votes), the weight assigned to each individual is identical. The alternative with the greatest number of votes is declared the winning choice. Any member who perceives a set of alternatives, at least one of which he regards as preferable to any of the alternatives presently scheduled, can insert his preferred alternative(s) among those scheduled for voting. All individuals possess identical information about the alternatives. Alternatives (leaders or policies) with the greatest number of votes displace any alternatives (leaders or policies) with fewer votes. The orders of elected officials are executed. Either all interelection decisions are subordinate or executory to those arrived at during the election stage, i.e., elections are in a sense controlling; or new decisions during the interelection period are governed by the preceding seven conditions, operating, however, under rather different institutional circumstances; or both.Dahl hypothesized that each of these conditions can be quantified, and suggested the term 'polyarchy' to describe an organization that scores high on the scales for all the eight conditions.Dahl viewed polyarchy as a system that manages to supply a high level of inclusiveness and a high level of liberalization to its citizens.Democracy and its criticsIn his 1989 book Democracy and Its Critics, Dahl gives the following characteristics of a polyarchy (p. 233):Control over governmental decisions about policy is constitutionally vested in elected officials. Elected officials are chosen and peacefully removed in relatively frequent, fair and free elections in which coercion is quite limited. Practically all adults have the right to vote in these elections. Most adults also have the right to run for the public offices for which candidates run in these elections. Citizens have an effectively enforced right to freedom of expression, particularly political expression, including criticism of the officials, the conduct of the government, the prevailing political, economic, and social system, and the dominant ideology. They also have access to alternative sources of information that are not monopolized by the government or any other single group. Finally, they have an effectively enforced right to form and join autonomous associations, including political associations, such as political parties and interest groups, that attempt to influence the government by competing in elections and by other peaceful means.CharacteristicsPolyarchy and its procedures may be insufficient for achieving full democracy. For example, poor people may be unable to participate in the political process. Some authors see polyarchy as a form of government that is not intended for greater social justice or cultural realization or to allow the repressed to politically participate.According to William I. Robinson, it is a system where a small group actually rules on behalf of capital, and the majority’s decision-making is confined to choosing among a select number of elites within tightly controlled elective processes. It is a form of consensual domination made possible by the structural domination of the global capital, which allows concentration of political power. Robert A. Dahl and Charles E. Lindblom noted that political bargaining is an essential feature of polyarchy, particularly in the US.Moreover, a perceived polyarchy—such as the United States—may bar a substantial number of its citizens from participating in its electoral process. For example, more than four million U.S. citizens residing in the U.S. territories, such as Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands, are excluded from participating in the election of any voting member of Congress, the political body that holds ultimate sovereignty over them. Robinson argues that they are effectively taxed without lawful representation (although these territories' status is a matter of popular consensus in individual cases).In Preface to Democratic Theory (1956), Dahl argues that an increase in citizen political involvement may not always be beneficial for polyarchy. An increase in the political participation of members of less educated classes, for example, could reduce the support for the basic norms of polyarchy, because members of those classes are more predisposed to be authoritarian-minded.In a discussion of contemporary British foreign policy, Mark Curtis writes, 'Polyarchy is generally what British leaders mean when they speak of promoting 'democracy' abroad. This is a system in which a small group actually rules and mass participation is confined to choosing leaders in elections managed by competing elites.'It is also being promoted by the transnational elites in the South as a different form from the authoritarianism and dictatorship to the North as a part of democracy promotion. Robinson argues that this is to cultivate transnational elites who will open up their countries following the transnational agenda of neoliberalism, whereby transnational capital mobility and globalized circuits of production and distribution are established. For example, it was promoted to Nicaragua, Chile, Haiti, the Philippines, South Africa and the former Soviet Bloc countries.See alsoCivil societyGovernanceState/Space theoryReferencesSourcesFull text.Pdf.Comparative politics Democracy Political science theories Dictatorship Power sharing", "machine_text": "Polyarchy is the term used to describe a political system in which power is held by multiple individuals or groups. This term was first coined by the political scientist Robert Dahl in the 1970s, and it has since become an important concept in the study of comparative politics, particularly in the field of democratic theory. A polyarchy is characterized by a combination of democratic and non-democratic elements. On one hand, there is typically a high degree of political pluralism, meaning that there are multiple political parties, interest groups, and civil society organizations that are active and relatively free to express their views and influence policy decisions. At the same time, however, there may be certain institutional or social barriers that prevent certain groups or individuals from fully participating in the political process, such as discriminatory election laws or deep-seated social prejudices. Despite these limitations, polyarchies are often seen as preferable to other types of political systems, such as authoritarian regimes or one-party states, because they offer at least some measure of political freedom and accountability. Polyarchies can also serve as a useful stepping stone to a more fully-formed democracy, particularly in countries with a history of authoritarianism or instability. Some scholars have raised concerns about the limitations of polyarchies, arguing that they may not go far enough in guaranteeing political freedom and equality for all citizens. Others have suggested that the concept of polyarchy may be too broad and imprecise to provide a clear roadmap for democratic reform. Nonetheless, for many political scientists and advocates of democratic governance, the concept of polyarchy remains a valuable tool for understanding and promoting democratic principles and practices around the world.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1081047}

Provincial organizations were reorganized into regional committees.OrganizationEach regional committee was responsible to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of their republic. In the case of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, every regional committee within the RSFSR was directly responsible to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

It served as a governing body for a specific region in the country. The committee consisted of a group of Communist Party officials who were responsible for the political, economic, and social development of their respective regions. The Regional Committee's first priority was the maintenance of state authority and the implementation of Party policy in its region. The Regional Committee had significant power, as it was in charge of appointing the local authorities and overseeing the implementation of their tasks. Regional Committees also had to establish and maintain a relationship between the state authorities and the population of their region. They had to promote the Communist ideology and Party values among the populace and create a harmonious and orderly society. The number of Regional Committees varied throughout Soviet history. In the 1950s, there were 105 Regional Committees, and in the 1980s, there were 118. Each Regional Committee had its Central Committee and specialized departments, including the organization, propaganda, industry, agriculture, and finance. Regional Committees held annual conferences, where the regional party elite regrouped, debated, and discussed policy. The head of the Regional Committee was the First Secretary, who held extraordinary power over the other officials in the region. This position could provide them the opportunity to climb higher up the political ladder on the national level. Soviet history saw many future Soviet leaders begin their careers as First Secretaries of Regional Committees. Regional Committees of the Communist Party played an essential role in the Soviet Union's political system. They were responsible for implementing Party policy, maintaining social control, and ensuring that the bureaucratic machinery worked effectively on a regional level. The system provided a way for the Soviet government to maintain its authority on a local level without interfering in the central government's functioning. However, the Regional Committees' inherent corruption, inefficiency, and disregard for popular opinion helped to further erode the Soviet Union's legitimacy, eventually leading to its fall in 1991.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 64087274}

Three weeks after the British Siege of Louisbourg (1745), the Wabanaki Confederacy of Acadia retaliated by attacking New England settlements along the coast of present-day Maine below the Kennebec River, the former border of Acadia. They attacked English settlements on the coast of present-day Maine between Berwick and St. Georges (Thomaston, Maine), within two months there were 11 raids - every town on the frontier had been attacked. Casco (also known as Falmouth and Portland) was the principal settlement.BackgroundAfter the two attacks on Annapolis Royal in 1744, Governor William Shirley put a bounty on the Passamaquoddy, Mi’kmaq and Maliseet on Oct 20. The following year, during the campaign, on August 23, 1745, Shirley declared war against the rest of the Wabanaki Confederacy – the Penobscot and Kennebec tribes. In response to the New England expedition against Louisbourg which finished in June 1745, the Wabanaki retaliated by attacking the New England border. New England braced itself for such an attack by appointing a provisional force of 450 to defend the frontier. After the attacks began they increased the number of soldiers by 175 men. Massachusetts established forts along the border with Acadia: Fort George at Brunswick (1715), St. George's Fort at Thomaston (1720), and Fort Richmond (1721) at Richmond.Fort Frederick was established at Pemaquid (Bristol, Maine).The campaignThe campaign began when, on July 19, Mi’kmaq from Nova Scotia, Maliseet and some from St. Francois attacked Fort St.George (Thomaston) and New Castle. They set fire to numerous buildings; killed cattle and took one villager captive. They also killed a person at Saco. At the same time, Penobscot and Norridgewock attacked Fort Frederick at Pemaquid. They took captive a woman, which alarmed the garrison but she escaped. The same month they killed a boy at Topsham and a man at New Meadows. In the same month, 30 Wabanaki attacked North Yarmouth and killed a man. At Flying-point they killed three members of a family and taking a daughter prisoner to Canada. During this raid on Flying-point, they also killed one man, made another prisoner, while another escaped. St. Georges garrison at Thomaston was attacked again and one company of men was killed, while three other men were taken captive. Near the garrison, two women were captured: one was taken to Canada, while the other escaped. They attacked Scarborough and one man killed. Then at Sheepscot they attacked and killed two and wounded one. On Sept 5 tribes of the Confederacy attacked Thomston (St. Georges) for the third time, killing and scalping two people.Aftermath In response to these events, Shirley sent more troops and munitions to the Maine frontier over the winter, anticipating the Wabanaki campaign in the spring of 1746. There were nine raids in the campaign of 1746 and 12 raids in the Northeast Coast campaign of 1747.See alsoMilitary history of Nova ScotiaNortheast Coast campaign (1703)Northeast Coast campaign (1723)NotesReferences'History of York County, Maine.

The campaign was a response to French activities in the region, which had been ongoing since the establishment of French settlements in Acadia in the early 17th century. The British were particularly concerned about the presence of the French fortress at Louisbourg, which had been captured by the French from the British in 1745. The campaign began with an attack on the French garrison at Canso, which was captured by British forces on May 24, 1745. The British then turned their attention to the French fortress at Louisbourg, which was heavily fortified and defended by a garrison of over 3,000 men. The British launched a major assault on Louisbourg on June 8, 1745, with a force of over 11,000 men. The attack was initially successful, with the British capturing several key positions and inflicting heavy casualties on the French. However, the attack stalled due to a lack of supplies and reinforcements, and the British were forced to abandon the siege on July 26, 1745. Despite the failure to capture Louisbourg, the Northeast Coast campaign was considered a success for the British, as it disrupted French activities in the region and demonstrated British military capabilities in North America. The campaign also paved the way for a larger campaign against Louisbourg in 1758, which ultimately resulted in the French surrendering the fortress to the British. The Northeast Coast campaign of 1745 also had significant cultural and social effects, as it brought together British and American forces, and highlighted the importance of the maritime economy to the region. It also contributed to the ongoing tensions between the British and French in North America, which would ultimately culminate in the Seven Years' War.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 34890149}

It has a large soundbox covered on one end with snakeskin. Like most other members of the huqin family of instruments, it has two strings and is held vertically. The instrument's name derives from 'dī,' meaning 'low,' and 'hú' (short for huqin).Sizes The instrument comes in three sizes: The xiaodihu (小低胡, also called dahu or cizhonghu), pitched one octave below the erhu (tuned D-A, with its lowest D one whole step above the viola's lowest C). It is the tenor member of the erhu family (the erhu being the soprano member and the zhonghu being the alto member). The zhongdihu (中低胡, pitched one octave below the zhonghu, (tuned G-D, as the middle strings of the cello). It is the bass member of the erhu family. The dadihu (大低胡, pitched one octave below the xiaodihu and two octaves below the erhu (tuned D-A, with its lowest D one whole step above the cello's lowest C). It is the contrabass member of the erhu family.Overview The dihu family was developed for orchestral use in the 1930s as lower members of the erhu family (the erhu being the soprano member and the zhonghu being the alto member) to increase the pitch range of the instruments used in a Chinese orchestra and allow music with harmony to be played.However, by the late 20th century it had largely fallen into disuse, part of the reason being that it is unwieldy to play. Also, the fact that (like other instruments in the huqin family) the bow passes between the instrument's two strings means that playing pizzicato is difficult; thus, the larger four-string gehu and diyingehu (or cello or double bass) are generally used in Chinese orchestras for the lower bowed string voices instead.See also Dahu (instrument) Diyingehu Laruan Huqin Traditional Chinese musical instrumentsReferencesExternal links Dihu page (Chinese) Xiaodihu photo (xiaodihu on left; erhu on right for comparison) Zhongdihu photo (zhongdihu on left; erhu on right for comparison) Dadihu photo (dadihu on left; erhu on right for comparison)Bowed instruments Chinese musical instruments Drumhead lutes Huqin family instruments", "machine_text": "Dihu is a stringed musical instrument from China. It is a bowed instrument that is commonly used in traditional Chinese music. The instrument is held vertically and is played with a bow made of horsehair. The sound of the Dihu can be described as bright and resonant, and it is often used to accompany Chinese opera and regional folk songs. The Dihu has a long history in China, with evidence of its use dating back to the Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD). The instrument was originally used in court and religious music, but later became popular in folk music. In the 20th century, the Dihu underwent a transformation, with improvements made in the materials and design of the instrument. This led to a resurgence in its popularity, and the instrument is now widely used in Chinese music. The Dihu is made of a cylindrical soundbox that is made from bamboo or wood, with a length of approximately 30 – 35 centimeters. The soundboard is made from snake skin, and the bridge and tailpiece are made from hardwood. The bow used to play the Dihu is similar to that used in the erhu, which is another Chinese bowed instrument. The Dihu has a range of approximately two octaves, and the player uses their fingers to create vibrato and other expressive techniques. It is often used to play melodic lines or to provide a drone accompaniment to other instruments or singers. The Dihu has been popularized in recent years by musicians such as Liu Fang and Wu Man, who have brought the instrument to a wider audience through their performances and recordings. It remains an important part of Chinese music, and its unique sound has captured the imagination of musicians around the world.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 4091796}

From 1971 to 1997, it was known as the Zairian Air Force (, or FAZA).HistoryShortly after the Congo became independent in 1960, the province of Katanga seceded, and the newly formed State of Katanga began building its own army. The Katangese seized most of the aircraft operated by the Aviation de la Force Publique and created the Katangese Air Force. The Congolese Air Force was created in mid-1961 largely to oppose the new Katangese Air Force. In 1963, Katanga was defeated by United Nations forces in Operation Grandslam, and the remaining assets of the Katangese Armed Forces were integrated into the Congolese Air Force.A Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) front company, Anstalt WIGMO, provided maintenance support to large parts of the FAC in the 1964–1968 period. The CIA also provided aircraft during the same period and pilots from late 1962 onwards.In July 1970 the Institute for Strategic Studies described the(FAZ) as numbering 650 with 21 combat aircraft. Aircraft strength was listed as ten T-6 Texan and eight T-28 Trojan armed trainers, two DC-4 and ten DC-3 transports, and six Alouette helicopters. The ISS said that 17 MB-326GB ground attack/trainer aircraft were on order, of which about five had been received.In July 1974 the International Institute for Strategic Studies described the FAZ as numbering 800 personnel with 33 aircraft. The Military Balance for 1974–75 listed one fighter wing with 17 MB-326GB, 6 AT-6G and 10 T-28 armed trainers, one transport wing with 9 C-47, 4 C-54, and 3 C-130, one training wing with 8 T-6 and 12 SF-260MC, and one helicopter squadron with 20 Aérospatiale Alouette II/III and 7 Aérospatiale SA 330 Pumas. It noted that 17 Mirage V and 3 C-130H were on order.The Air Combat Information Group states that by the mid-1980s the FAZ suffered from the same problems as the rest of the Zairian Armed Forces, including lack of funding and widespread corruption. According to FAZA helicopter pilot Pierre Yambuya's tell-all memoir, he regularly had to perform so-called 'special missions', consisting of moving prisoners to places where they were tortured or assassinated. On other occasions, he had to drop packages of up to 600 kg. filled with corpses and debris in a river.In the 1980s the air force was theoretically organised into the , at Kinshasa (N'djili Airport?), with the 19th Logistics Support Wing (C-130s and Dakotas), the 12th Liaison Wing (helicopters, MU-2Js, and Cessna 310Rs) and the 13th Training Wing. Theat Kamina comprised the 21st Fighter-Attack Wing with Mirage 5s and MB.326Ks, and the 22nd Tactical Transport Wing, with 221 Squadron operating the two of three originally delivered Buffalos.The extreme corruption of the force meant that Zairian aircraft were more often used for private 'business' of their fliers and their superiors than operations against rebels. From an originally delivered eight Dassault Mirage 5Ms, only seven were left by 1988, with five being lost in different accidents. By the mid-1990s the last three were sold. Michela Wrong's In the Footsteps of Mr. Kurtz: Living on the Brink of Disaster in the Congo reports a story that the remaining Mirages were sold in France whilst there for maintenance, in order to finance a Zairian Air Force commander's retirement.The FAZ played little part in the First Congo War, with most aircraft inoperable. Some aircraft were imported and used by Serbian mercenaries, but had little operational effect. The FAC has reportedly hired Georgian ex-military pilots to train FARDC pilots in counterinsurgency operations, who may also have participated in combat operations.Current structureAs of 2007, all military aircraft in the Democratic Republic of the Congo were operated by the Air Force. Jane's World Air Forces states that the Air Force has an estimated strength of 1,800 personnel and is organised into two Air Groups. These Groups command five wings and nine squadrons, of which not all are operational. 1 Air Group is located at Kinshasa and consists of Liaison Wing, Training Wing and Logistical Wing and has a strength of five squadrons. 2 Tactical Air Group is located at Kamina and consists of Pursuit and Attack Wing and Tactical Transport Wing and has a strength of four squadrons. Foreign private military companies have reportedly been contracted to provide the DRC's aerial reconnaissance capability using small propeller aircraft fitted with sophisticated equipment. Jane's states that People's Air and Air Defence Force of Angola fighter aircraft would be made available to defend Kinshasa if it came under attack.Like the other services, the Congolese Air Force is not capable of carrying out its responsibilities. Few of the Air Force's aircraft are currently flyable or capable of being restored to service and it is unclear whether the Air Force is capable of maintaining even unsophisticated aircraft. Moreover, Jane's states that the Air Force's Ecole de Pilotage is 'in near total disarray' though Belgium has offered to restart the Air Force's pilot training program.Known chiefs of staff Major General Faustin Munene in 1997 Brigadier General Jean Bitanihirwa Kamara in 2005 Major General Djedje Ndamba in 2006 Major General John Numbi in 2007 Major General Rigobert Massamba Musungu from 2007 Brigadier General (Major General from July 2018) Numbi Ngoie Enoch since 2014AircraftAccording to Flight International 2004 and IISS Military Balance 2007 past aircraft have included the MiG-23 Flogger, the Lockheed C-130 Hercules, the de Havilland Canada DHC-5 Buffalo, the North American T-28 Trojan, and the Eurocopter AS332 Super Puma. Jane's World Air Forces 2007 states that the Air Force operates between 9 and 22 Mil Mi-24/35s attack helicopters, and a single Mi-26. The condition of the DRC's aircraft which are not currently in service is generally so poor that they cannot be repaired and returned to flyable status. The DRC's single Mil Mi-26 'Halo' was shown as a photo in Air Forces Monthly (AFM)'s July 2007 issue without obvious rust and appearing to be in good condition which was taken on April 12, 2007, at Lubumbashi.

Originally established in 1960, the Air Force currently operates a small fleet of aging aircraft, which includes transport planes and helicopters. The FARDC is tasked with the responsibility of providing air support to various operations carried out by the Congolese army. The FARDC has a long history of internal and external conflicts. During the Second Congo War, the Air Force played a significant role in providing logistical and tactical support to the armed forces. However, some of its members have been accused of human rights abuses, including the bombing of civilian targets. The FARDC has also suffered from a lack of funding, which has led to poor maintenance of its aircraft and equipment. The FARDC’s fleet includes four transport planes, which have a range of up to 3,500 km and a payload capacity of 22,500 kg. These planes are primarily used for transporting soldiers, equipment, and humanitarian aid to remote areas of the country. The Air Force also operates various helicopters, including Mi-26, Mi-17, and Mi-24 models, which are used for transport, reconnaissance, and combat missions. The FARDC has a relatively small number of trained pilots and ground crew, with many personnel lacking proper training and experience. The Air Force has also faced challenges in terms of logistical support, with many of its bases lacking adequate infrastructure and supplies to support operations. In recent years, the FARDC has received support from various international partners, including the United Nations and the African Union. These organizations have provided training, equipment, and other types of assistance to improve the capabilities and effectiveness of the Congolese Air Force. Despite the challenges it faces, the FARDC remains an important component of the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s armed forces, providing vital support to military and humanitarian operations across the country.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 16732356}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Bracket creep\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Bracket creep is usually defined as the process by which inflation pushes wages and salaries into higher tax brackets, leading to fiscal drag. However, even if there is only one tax bracket, or one remains within the same tax bracket, there will still be bracket creep resulting in a higher proportion of income being paid in tax. That is, although the marginal tax rate remains unchanged with inflation, the average tax rate will increase.Most progressive tax systems are not adjusted for inflation. As wages and salaries rise in nominal terms under the influence of inflation they become more highly taxed, even though in real terms the value of the wages and salaries has not increased at all. The net effect is that in real terms taxes rise unless the tax rates or brackets are adjusted to compensate.Examples Suppose a person earns 20,000 per year and is liable to 20", "machine_text": "Bracket creep is a term used to describe the gradual increase in an individual's tax liability due to inflation. It occurs when a person's income increases just enough to push them into a higher tax bracket, even though their real buying power has not changed. This phenomenon is often referred to as 'creeping' because it happens slowly over time and may go unnoticed by workers and policymakers. Bracket creep occurs when a country's tax system uses fixed tax brackets that are not indexed to inflation. As prices rise, wages and salaries rise too, putting taxpayers into higher income tax brackets without any real increase in their purchasing power. The result is that taxpayers end up paying more in taxes than they should. To illustrate this, let's say a person earns 50,000 a year in 2021 and is taxed at a rate of 20", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 709199}

Co-written and co-produced by frontman Mick Hucknall, it makes extensive use of a sample of Dutch duo the Goodmen's 1993 hit 'Give It Up'. It became Simply Red's first and only1 single on the UK Singles Chart, staying at the top for four weeks in September and October 1995, and was also a chart hit in mainland Europe and Australia, but failed to generate long-term success in North America.Background and release When 'Fairground' went straight to number-one in its first week on the UK Singles Chart, it had already been released to UK radio stations almost a month before, via satellite with the first promotional copies following a few days later. The single was placed in heavy rotation on Top 40 radio stations, which resulted in it reaching the top of the airplay charts, a position that was held for three weeks. When the single was released to the public on 18 September 1995, it had already been the most played record on British radio.Composition Producer Andy Wright has said that for Fairground, Mick Hucknall wanted to do a Brazilian, carnival-style track. Whilst Mick was at the dentist for two hours, Andy had the idea to sample a record that he knew of: Give It Up by The Goodmen, which in-turn sampled Fanfarra (Cabua-le-le) by Sérgio Mendes. To round out the track, Fritz McIntyre played the house-style piano element, Ian Kirkham used the EWI (electronic wind instrument) to play the clarinet-style part, and Andy Wright made the wobbly, dreamy sound heard in the verses.Critical reception Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet noted the 'hot rhythms and odd harmonies' of the song, adding that the album 'would have needed even more such songs'. AllMusic editor William Ruhlmann said that Mick Hucknall 'opts for a Latin-tinged sound that ends up evoking Herb Alpert more than Milton Nascimento'. Another editor, Jon O'Brien deemed the song 'a mesmerizing fusion of tribal rhythms and ambient chillout pop'. Larry Flick from Billboard described it as an 'expectedly romantic soul tune', adding that 'fueled by his now instantly familiar voice, the track combines old-school warmth with street-smart percussion that is largely derived from samples of 'Give It Up' by the Goodmen. At the core are wonderfully soothing lyrics and a melody that permanently sticks to the brain upon impact.' Tom Ewing of Freaky Trigger commented that it 'surprised people at the time, and on the verses at least it's their strangest-sounding single. 'Driving down an endless road...' it begins, and that's not at all a bad description of the lonesome vibe here – the odd combination of flowing, tumbling Latin percussion and Hucknall's ruminative vocal, working together to create something genuinely arresting, even haunting.'Pan-European magazine MusicMedia noted that it is 'totally different from Hucknall's previous singles but still very much him thanks to the one-in-a-million voice and the trademark composition.' They added that 'the fairground attraction' of the single is its 'percussive arrangement and clubiness.' A reviewer from Music Week rated it five out of five, picking it as Single of the Week. The reviewer added, 'No wonder radio has leapt on this, a charmingly-delivered song which couples instant commerciality in the tune stakes with a hip tribal backing. Headed straight for the summit.' Alan Jones said, 'Despite its heavily syncopated underpinning, it is a stylish and straightforward pop song with Mick Hucknall's usual high calibre vocal and an instantly commercial chorus.' James Hamilton from the magazine's RM Dance Update called it 'attractive'. People Magazine”'s reviewer wrote that the 'energetic' song 'combines soulful abandon with tribal ecstasy.' David Gaskey from The Rice Thresher described it as 'an innovative, futuristic jazz/pop song inspired by a popular fairground outside of Milan.' Mark Sutherland from Smash Hits stated that Hucknall 'still has a lovely singing voice'. However, he felt the song 'sort of tinkles along merrily without really going anywhere.'Chart performance It was the first and only single by the group to reach No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart. It spent four weeks at the top, and fourteen weeks in the top 40. The track also reached No. 1 in Ireland and Italy and peaked within the top 10 in more than 10 countries, including Australia, Germany, New Zealand and Zimbabwe. A remix by Soulshock and Karlin was included on the US single release and received moderate success on RB radio but failed to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at No. 14 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100.In 2012, 'Fairground' was ranked No. 47 in NMEs list of the '50 best-selling tracks of the 90s', adding: 'Shamelessly lifting the clattering samba percussion from The Goodmen's 'Give It Up' (but giving due credit), Mick Hucknall greeted his post-'Stars' future with a mid-tempo ballad that sounded like an on-the-money dance track. Everyone got on board the rollercoaster and Hucknall had a new diamond for his gnasher.'As of October 2018, the single has sold 718,463 copies according to the Official Charts Company.Music video A music video was produced to promote the single, directed by Irish filmmaker Michael Geoghegan. The video (which uses the shorter single version) shows Mick Hucknall driving in his Jaguar XK140 to and singing at Blackpool Pleasure Beach in Blackpool, Lancashire, that had been closed for the day and had been invaded by a group of his friends and opened up again.

This gemstone is a colorless, transparent form of crystallized carbon that is known for its exceptional hardness, brilliance, and fire. Crystal Diamond is formed deep inside the earth's mantle over millions of years under intense heat and pressure. It is the ultimate symbol of enduring love and commitment and is often used in engagement rings and other fine jewelry. As a result of its rarity and beauty, it is also considered a symbol of wealth and power. The unique properties of Crystal Diamond are a result of its crystal structure, which is composed of many tiny, perfect octahedrons that are perfectly aligned with each other. This structure is what gives the Diamond its exceptional clarity and brilliance, as well as its remarkable durability and hardness. The clarity of Crystal Diamond is such that it allows light to pass through it uninterrupted, which results in a luminous fire that reflects off the Diamond's facets.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"1986 Philippine presidential election\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The 1986 Philippine presidential and vice presidential elections were held on February 7, 1986. Popularly known as the 1986 snap election, it is among the landmark events that led up to the People Power Revolution, the downfall of the presidency of Ferdinand Marcos, and the accession of Corazon C. Aquino as president.BackgroundInfluence of the American mediaAfter being dared by an American journalist, President Ferdinand E. Marcos declared a snap election during an interview on the American Broadcasting Company political affairs programme, This Week with David Brinkley in November 1985. On December 3, the Batasang Pambansa (National Assembly) passed a law setting the date of the election on February 7, 1986. On February 4, 1986, Marcos declared February 6 and 7 as nationwide non-working special public holidays to 'give all registered voters fullest opportunity to exercise their right of suffrage.'The assassination of Senator Benigno 'Ninoy' Aquino Jr. on August 21, 1983, revived the oppositionist press, and not far behind it did the pro-Marcos press retaliate. Both catered to the intense news-hunger of the Filipino people, but it was a smaller group of reporters who delivered the crucial blow to Marcos' image, with rumors circulating about Marcos' hidden wealth and war record. An example of this would be the article written by Eduardo Lachica in December 1982. It stirred interest after being published in The Asian Wall Street Journal on the alleged Marcos property holdings in New York.By late January 1985, the pursuit for the truth behind the rumors began with Lewis M. Simons, a Tokyo-based correspondent for the San Jose Mercury News, who sent a memo to his desk editor, Jonathan Krim. There had been incessant speculations of Philippine 'capital flight' that not only involved Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos themselves, but also government officials and friends of the first family. Simons provided Krim with a list of names, telling him to look into Philippine investments in the San Francisco Bay area. Krim handed over several clips (including Lachica's article) and miscellaneous letters from the Filipino exile community to the investigative reporter attached with a note, 'Look into this.' Carey began his paper trail after setting up his personal computer and a telephone modem as well as using real-estate data bases to acquire both California and out-of-state records. Another method he used in tracking the story were his interviews with the members of the Filipino exiled opposition who were divided between those who were resolute in helping him and those who deemed themselves apolitical, fearing reprisals if they spoke. In an interview, Carey says, 'I kept telling them, 'I'm not interested in quoting people, I'm not going to use yours or any names. I'm interested in documentary evidence,' That convinced people....' Due to budgetary concerns, he continued his trail by exploring records in New York and Chicago through telephone. At a later date, Katherine Ellison from the San Francisco Bureau, who Carey dubs as another 'great investigative reporter,' joined the group as they conducted interviews and convinced reluctant locals to provide essential information.On June 23–25, 1985, the Mercury News series under the by-lines of Carey, Ellison, and Simons elicited a staggering response after revealing a list of names, showing how the Filipino elite had illegally invested millions in the U.S., why real estate conditions made California a prime investment territory, and how capital flight fueled Philippine insurgency. Meanwhile, local publications in the Philippines such as Malaya, Veritas, Business Day, and Mr. and Mrs. all reprinted the series. There were protests on the streets, attempts by the National Assembly's opposition minority to file an impeachment hearing(which was quickly annulled) while Marcos was forced to order an impartial inquiry (though it lasted briefly).The international clamor surprised the three Mercury News investigators with Carey commenting, 'There's a vast difference between simple allegations and something with a factual, documentary basis,' he says. 'It provokes a totally different psychological reaction in the readers. Gossip stirs their apathy; facts galvanize them to action.'After the successful publication of the series, newer articles were produced by the Mercury News team, among other things, such as how the Manila elitists smuggled fortunes, in the form of American currency, out of the country. More reporters from The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, and The New York Times developed other angles as well. The most significant were those uncovered by Times' Jeff Gerth, who wrote on the misuse of American aid money by the Marcos' administration. Although Marcos continued to deny these allegations, it did little to avert the consequences. His support in the congress quickly dissipated while news of his misrule endangered U.S. military interests. Though revelations of Marcos' hidden wealth disparaged him in America, in the Philippines, it was the truth of his war records that did him in.Organizing the 1986 Philippine electionsOn November 4, 1985, Sam Donaldson and George Will interviewed President Marcos on the American Broadcasting Company political affairs program This Week with David Brinkley. Marcos was being asked about his policies and support when, without warning, he announced that he would hold a snap election on February 7, 1986, a year earlier than the supposed 1987 election. Marcos said that in the snap election, the vice president would also be determined. Also, the final decision regarding the election would be determined by the National Assembly. On December 3, 1985, the Batasang Pambansa passed a law setting the date of the election on February 7, 1986.Marcos declared the early elections since he believed that this would solidify the support of United States, silence the protests and criticisms both in the Philippines and the United States, and finally put the issues regarding the death of Benigno Aquino Jr. to rest.The opposition saw two problems regarding the announcement of Marcos. First is the credibility of the announcement since at the time two-thirds of the National Assembly were from Kilusang Bagong Lipunan, which means that they could decide not to push through with the snap election. This would then give Marcos an image that he was willing to entertain opposition, which would then contribute to his popularity. Second problem is that the opposition was yet to choose a single presidential candidate to who had a chance to win. This posed a problem for them since the opposition were yet to be united, supporting only one presidential candidate.The opposition, was divided between the widow of Benigno Aquino Jr., Corazon 'Cory' Aquino, and Doy Laurel, son of President Jose P. Laurel. Cardinal Jaime Sin talked to both the potential candidates. Aquino was hesitant to run since she believed that she was not the best and most able choice. Aquino said she would be willing to run if there was a petition campaign with at least a million signatures supporting her as a presidential candidate. Doy on the other hand, was earnest in running as president since he believed his family background, training, and experience had prepared him for the presidency.Campaign The campaign period lasted 45 days, from December 19, 1985, to February 5, 1986.As the election campaign continued, Marcos was able to campaign in selected key cities while Aquino was able to campaign intensively and extensively, even going to remote places from the north of the Philippines to the south of the Philippines. The Aquino campaign concluded a rally that is believed to have 800,000 participants wearing yellow in Rizal Park and Roxas Boulevard forming a 'sea of yellow'.Results About 85,000 precincts opened at seven o'clock in the morning of Election Day. Each precinct was administered by a Board of Election Inspectors (BEI), which was tasked to oversee voting. The BEIs did not continuously abide by the stipulated voting procedure, which raised the impression of fraud.The voting period was also scheduled to close at three o'clock in the afternoon but was extended to give way for people who were in line. Counting of the ballots followed and in most precincts was able to finish by six o'clock in the evening.Results showed that a huge percentage of eligible electorates did not vote. Out of the 26 million registered voters, only 20 million ballots were cast. This showed a decreased percentage of voters from the 1984 election, which had 89", "machine_text": "The 1986 Philippine presidential election, also known as the Snap Election, was held on February 7, 1986. It was the first presidential election held under the new Constitution of the Philippines, which was ratified in 1983. The election was called by President Ferdinand Marcos, who sought to legitimize his more than twenty years of martial rule by winning a fresh mandate. The main opposition contender was Corazon Aquino, the widow of slain opposition leader Benigno Aquino Jr. Aquino ran under the banner of the United Nationalist Democratic Organization (UNIDO), which was composed of various opposition parties and groups, including the Lakas ng Bayan (People Power) movement. She was joined by former senator Salvador Laurel as her running mate. Marcos, on the other hand, ran under the Kilusang Bagong Lipunan (New Society Movement), the political arm of his regime. He was supported by various politicians, businessmen, and military officials. The election was marred by widespread allegations of fraud, violence, and intimidation. The Commission on Elections (Comelec) declared Marcos the winner with 10,807,197 votes, while Aquino garnered 9,291,700 votes. However, the opposition, led by the Catholic Church and various civil society groups, challenged the results and launched a campaign of mass protest and civil disobedience. The culmination of this movement was the People Power Revolution, a peaceful uprising that saw millions of Filipinos take to the streets in Manila and other cities. The military, which was previously loyal to Marcos, eventually shifted its allegiance to the opposition, and Marcos fled the country on February 25, 1986. Aquino was sworn in as the new President of the Philippines, marking a new era in Philippine politics. The 1986 Philippine presidential election remains a pivotal moment in Philippine history and democracy, as it led to the restoration of democratic institutions and the rule of law. It also inspired other movements for non-violent resistance and civil disobedience around the world.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 3148339}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Doherty amplifier\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Doherty amplifier is a modified class B radio frequency amplifier invented by William H. Doherty of Bell Telephone Laboratories Inc in 1936. Whereas conventional class B amplifiers can clip on high input-signal levels, the Doherty power amplifier can accommodate signals with high peak-to-average power ratios by using two amplifier circuits within the one overall amplifier to accommodate the different signal levels.In this way, the amplifier achieves a high level of linearity while retaining good power efficiency.In Doherty's day, within the Western Electric product line, the eponymous electronic device was operated as a linear amplifier with a driver which was modulated. In the 50,000-watt implementation, the driver was a complete 5,000-watt transmitter which could, if necessary, be operated independently of the Doherty amplifier and the Doherty amplifier was used to raise the 5,000-watt level to the required 50,000-watt level.The amplifier was usually configured as a grounded-cathode, carrier–peak amplifier using two vacuum tubes in parallel connection, one as a class B carrier tube and the other as a class B peak tube (power transistors in modern implementations). The tubes' source (driver) and load (antenna) were split and combined through +90 and −90 degree phase shifting networks. Alternate configurations included a grounded-grid carrier tube and a grounded-cathode peak tube whereby the driver power was effectively passed-through the carrier tube and was added to the resulting output power, but this benefit was more appropriate for the earlier and less efficient triode implementations rather than the later and more efficient tetrode implementations.Successor broadcast developments As successor to Western Electric Company Inc. for radio broadcast transmitters, the Doherty concept was considerably refined by Continental Electronics Manufacturing Company of Dallas, Texas.Early Continental Electronics designs, by James O. Weldon and others, retained most of the characteristics of Doherty's amplifier but added medium-level screen-grid modulation of the driver (317B, et al.).A further refinement of Doherty's amplifier was the high-level screen-grid modulation scheme invented by Joseph B. Sainton (317C, et al.).Sainton's 317C series consisted of a class C carrier tube in parallel connection with a class C peak tube. The tubes' source (driver) and load (antenna) were split and combined through +90 and −90 degree phase-shifting networks as in Doherty's amplifier. The unmodulated radio frequency carrier was applied to the control grids of both tubes with the same control grid bias points. Carrier modulation was applied to the screen grids of both tubes, but the screen grid bias points of the carrier and peak tubes were different and were established such that the peak tube was cut off when modulation was absent and the amplifier was producing rated unmodulated carrier power, and both tubes were conducting and each tube was contributing twice the rated carrier power during 100", "machine_text": "Doherty amplifier is a type of power amplifier that is commonly used in communication systems. The Doherty amplifier was invented by William H. Doherty in 1936, and it has been used in radio and television transmitters for many decades. The Doherty amplifier is a hybrid architecture that consists of two amplifiers: a main amplifier (PA) and an auxiliary amplifier (AA). The main amplifier operates at a high power level, while the auxiliary amplifier operates at a lower power level. The two amplifiers work together to produce a high-efficiency, high-power output signal. The Doherty amplifier is known for its high efficiency, which means that it can produce a high-power output signal with a low power input. This makes it a popular choice for communication systems that require high power output with low power consumption. The Doherty amplifier has also been used in cellular and broadband communication systems, where it is used to amplify radio frequency signals. It is particularly useful in LTE (Long-Term Evolution) and WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) systems, where it is used to amplify the modulated signal before it is transmitted over the air. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the Doherty amplifier, as it offers a number of advantages over other types of power amplifiers. These include high efficiency, low distortion, and a wide frequency range. Overall, the Doherty amplifier remains an important technology for the communication industry. Its high efficiency and other advantages make it a popular choice for a wide range of applications, from radio and television broadcasting to cellular and broadband communication systems.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 23718712}

It is currently drawn by Eric Allie.CharactersCarmen – a 'feisty' conservative and a Republican. For a brief time, she had a crush on Tucker Carlson. Carmen made her first appearance at least 4 months before the strip began, in one of Stantis's editorial cartoons.Winslow – named for the town of Winslow, Arizona, is a coyote with political aspirations who acts patronizing, condescending and impulsive. His liberal responses are typically the source of the strip's jokes. Carmen is continuously frustrated by Winslow's assumption that she should be a liberal feminist. Early in the strip's run, Winslow had a crush on Condoleezza Rice, even writing a poem about her (which Carmen initially misunderstood as being a poem about herself).Minor recurring charactersKevin, the Lost Bunny of the Apocalypse.

It follows the adventures of a group of anthropomorphic animals, including a young coyote named Carmen, a penguin named Winslow, and a conservative-leaning goat named Winslow's father. The comic strip is known for its political commentary, often taking on hot-button issues such as gun control, immigration, and climate change. Stantis, who has worked as an editorial cartoonist for years, uses his strip as a platform to express his own views on current events and societal issues. Prickly City has gained both praise and criticism for its political content. Some readers appreciate Stantis' willingness to tackle difficult topics and provide a conservative perspective in a medium dominated by liberal voices. Others, however, find the strip to be too partisan and polarizing. In addition to its political content, Prickly City also features a cast of lovable and relatable characters that resonate with readers of all ages. Carmen, the spunky main character, often gets into trouble as she navigates the challenges of growing up. Winslow, the loyal penguin, provides a steady voice of reason and humor. Prickly City has been syndicated in numerous newspapers across the United States and has gained a loyal following of readers who appreciate its intelligent, thought-provoking commentary and relatable characters.

He was the leading baritone of the Royal Swedish Opera (RSO) from 1896–1918, and thereafter sang roles periodically with the company until his last stage performance in 1938. From 1923-1939 he served as the director of the RSO. He also sang leading roles as a guest artist with opera companies internationally, drawing particular acclaim for his portrayal of the title character in Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Don Giovanni.In 1899, Forsell was awarded the Litteris et Artibus and, a decade later, he was named a Hovsångare. The Royal Swedish Academy of Music awarded him membership in 1906.Early life and education Born in Stockholm, Forsell was the son of Carl August Forsell, a sea captain, and Axeline Forsell (née Åberg). Before his singing career, he served in the Swedish Army; becoming a second lieutenant in 1890 and lieutenant in 1896. In 1897 he requested and was granted an honorable dismissal from the army, but continue to serve as a member of the Uppland Regiment reserves through 1901.While serving in the army, he pursued voice studies with Julius Günther (1818–1904) at the Royal College of Music, Stockholm from 1892-1894. After graduating from college he studied singing further in Paris in 1895-1896 and later in Stockholm with Hedvig Willman (1841–1887) and Signe Hebbe (1837–1925).Singing career Forsell made his operatic debut at the Royal Swedish Opera, Stockholm, in 1896 as Figaro in The Barber of Seville. He would remain that opera house's premier baritone through 1918, and thereafter appeared only periodically at that theatre up until his retirement from the stage in 1938. He sang in several world premieres with the company, including Wilhelm Stenhammar's Tirfing (1898) and Andreas Hallén's Valdemarskatten (1899, the title role of Valdemar IV of Denmark). He also appeared in the Swedish premieres of Eugene Onegin (1903, title role), Tosca (1904, Scarpia), and Salome (1909, Jochanaan).Forsell also established an international career. From 1902-1906 he sang regularly at the Royal Danish Theatre in Copenhagen. In 1909-1910 he appeared at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City, performing such parts as Tonio in Pagliacci, Amfortas in Parsifal, Figaro in The Barber of Seville, Telramund in Lohengrin, Germont in La traviata and Yeletsky in the United States premiere of Tchaikovsky's The Queen of Spades.The title role in Mozart's Don Giovanni was probably his most famous interpretation. He sang the part numerous times, including during the 1909 season at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London, and at the 1930 Salzburg Festival. Other major opera houses in which Forsell sang the Don and various leading parts were the Berlin State Opera, the Dutch National Opera, and the Vienna State Opera. In 1915 he portrayed the role of the Foreigner/Francesco del Giocondo in the world premiere of Max von Schillings's Mona Lisa at the Staatsoper Stuttgart.Opera director, teacher, and later life Forsell become the Director (Intendant) of the Royal Swedish Opera at the start of the 1923-1924 season, and performed less frequently on stage as a consequence. His voice, however, remained in fine condition. His final opera performance was on his 70th birthday when he sang the role of Count Almaviva in Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro at the RSO. He retired from his director's position in May 1939 and died in Stockholm two years later. His wife, soprano Gurli Carlström (married 1901), pre-deceased him in 1935. Their son, Björn Forsell, was also a successful opera singer.In addition to his administrative duties at Stockholm's opera house during the 1920s and '30s, Forsell taught voice as a professor of singing at the Royal College of Music, Stockholm. His pupils included Joel Berglund, Jussi Björling, Magna Lykseth-Scherfven, Aksel Schiøtz, Hjördis Schymberg, Set Svanholm, and Inez Wassner.Recordings Forsell's gramophone legacy consists of several batches of acoustic 78-rpm discs of arias and songs (made initially by the GramophoneTypewriter Company prior to World War I) and some subsequent electrical recordings of live stage performances. Many of these recordings are available on modern CD reissues, most notably a four-disc anthology produced in 1994 by Caprice Records (CAP 21586).

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Representation theory of the symmetric group\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "In mathematics, the representation theory of the symmetric group is a particular case of the representation theory of finite groups, for which a concrete and detailed theory can be obtained. This has a large area of potential applications, from symmetric function theory to problems of quantum mechanics for a number of identical particles.The symmetric group Sn has order n!. Its conjugacy classes are labeled by partitions of n. Therefore according to the representation theory of a finite group, the number of inequivalent irreducible representations, over the complex numbers, is equal to the number of partitions of n. Unlike the general situation for finite groups, there is in fact a natural way to parametrize irreducible representations by the same set that parametrizes conjugacy classes, namely by partitions of n or equivalently Young diagrams of size n.Each such irreducible representation can in fact be realized over the integers (every permutation acting by a matrix with integer coefficients); it can be explicitly constructed by computing the Young symmetrizers acting on a space generated by the Young tableaux of shape given by the Young diagram. The dimensionof the representation that corresponds to the Young diagramis given by the hook length formula.To each irreducible representation ρ we can associate an irreducible character, χρ. To compute χρ(π) where π is a permutation, one can use the combinatorial Murnaghan–Nakayama rule . Note that χρ is constant on conjugacy classes, that is, χρ(π) = χρ(σ−1πσ) for all permutations σ.Over other fields the situation can become much more complicated.If the field K has characteristic equal to zero or greater than n then by Maschke's theorem the group algebra KSn is semisimple. In these cases the irreducible representations defined over the integers give the complete set of irreducible representations (after reduction modulo the characteristic if necessary).However, the irreducible representations of the symmetric group are not known in arbitrary characteristic. In this context it is more usual to use the language of modules rather than representations. The representation obtained from an irreducible representation defined over the integers by reducing modulo the characteristic will not in general be irreducible. The modules so constructed are called Specht modules, and every irreducible does arise inside some such module. There are now fewer irreducibles, and although they can be classified they are very poorly understood. For example, even their dimensions are not known in general.The determination of the irreducible modules for the symmetric group over an arbitrary field is widely regarded as one of the most important open problems in representation theory.Low-dimensional representationsSymmetric groupsThe lowest-dimensional representations of the symmetric groups can be described explicitly, as done in .This work was extended to the smallest k degrees (explicitly for , and ) in , and over arbitrary fields in .The smallest two degrees in characteristic zero are described here:Every symmetric group has a one-dimensional representation called the trivial representation, where every element acts as the one by one identity matrix.For , there is another irreducible representation of degree 1, called the sign representation or alternating character, which takes a permutation to the one by one matrix with entry ±1 based on the sign of the permutation.These are the only one-dimensional representations of the symmetric groups, as one-dimensional representations are abelian, and the abelianization of the symmetric group is C2, the cyclic group of order 2.For all n, there is an n-dimensional representation of the symmetric group of order n!, called the , which consists of permuting n coordinates.This has the trivial subrepresentation consisting of vectors whose coordinates are all equal.The orthogonal complement consists of those vectors whose coordinates sum to zero, and when , the representation on this subspace is an -dimensional irreducible representation, called the standard representation.Another -dimensional irreducible representation is found by tensoring with the sign representation. An exterior powerof the standard representationis irreducible provided.For , these are the lowest-dimensional irreducible representations of Sn – all other irreducible representations have dimension at least n.However for , the surjection from S4 to S3 allows S4 to inherit a two-dimensional irreducible representation.For , the exceptional transitive embedding of S5 into S6 produces another pair of five-dimensional irreducible representations.Alternating groupsThe representation theory of the alternating groups is similar, though the sign representation disappears. For , the lowest-dimensional irreducible representations are the trivial representation in dimension one, and the -dimensional representation from the other summand of the permutation representation, with all other irreducible representations having higher dimension, but there are exceptions for smaller n.The alternating groups forhave only one one-dimensional irreducible representation, the trivial representation.Forthere are two additional one-dimensional irreducible representations, corresponding to maps to the cyclic group of order 3:and .For , there is just one irreducible representation of degree , and this is the smallest degree of a non-trivial irreducible representation.Forthe obvious analogue of the -dimensional representation is reducible – the permutation representation coincides with the regular representation, and thus breaks up into the three one-dimensional representations, asis abelian; see the discrete Fourier transform for representation theory of cyclic groups.For , there is just oneirreducible representation, but there are the exceptional irreducible representations of dimension 1.For , there are two dual irreducible representations of dimension 3, corresponding to its action as icosahedral symmetry.For , there is an extra irreducible representation of dimension 5 corresponding to the exceptional transitive embedding of A5 in A6.Tensor products of representationsKronecker coefficientsThe tensor product of two representations ofcorresponding to the Young diagramsis a combination of irreducible representations of ,The coefficientsare called the Kronecker coefficients of the symmetric group.

Reduced Kronecker coefficients can be written as linear combinations of Littlewood-Richardson coefficients via a change of bases in the space of symmetric functions, giving rise to expressions that are manifestly integral although not manifestly positive. Reduced Kronecker coefficients can also be written in terms of Kronecker and Littlewood-Richardson coefficientsvia Littlewood's formulaConversely, it is possible to recover the Kronecker coefficients as linear combinations of reduced Kronecker coefficients.Reduced Kronecker coefficients are implemented in the computer algebra system SageMath.Eigenvalues of complex representationsGiven an elementof cycle-typeand order , the eigenvalues ofin a complex representation ofare of the typewith , where the integersare called the cyclic exponents ofwith respect to the representation.There is a combinatorial description of the cyclic exponents of the symmetric group (and wreath products thereof).

One of the main applications of representation theory of the symmetric group is in the study of combinatorics. In particular, the representation theory of the symmetric group allows for the study of generating functions, which give a unified way to represent different combinatorial objects, such as permutations, partitions, and Young tableaux. Another important application of representation theory of the symmetric group is in the study of algebraic geometry. The representations of the symmetric group can be used to construct algebraic varieties known as Schubert varieties, which are important objects in the study of flag manifolds and intersection theory. In addition, representation theory of symmetric groups is closely connected to the theory of Lie algebras and Lie groups, which are important objects in geometry and physics. The representation theory of the symmetric group provides a powerful tool for studying these objects and their interactions. Overall, representation theory of the symmetric group is a rich and vibrant area of mathematics that connects various areas of pure mathematics, as well as with applications in combinatorics, algebraic geometry, and physics.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 874641}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"SAFA programme\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Historical overviewThe SAFA Programme was initially launched by the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) in 1996. The Programme was not based upon a European legal binding basis, but upon a commitment of the Directors General of the participating ECAC Member States. The scope of the inspections performed on ‘foreign’ aircraft involved those aircraft which were not used or operated under the control of the inspecting competent authority.On 30 April 2004, the Directive 2004/36/CE of the European Parliament and of the council on the safety of third-country aircraft using Community airports (the so-called 'SAFA Directive') was published, creating a legal obligation upon EU Member States to perform ramp inspections on third country aircraft landing at their airports, where ‘third country aircraft’ implied aircraft not used or operated under control of a competent authority of an EU Member State. Nevertheless, the Directive didn't prohibit in any way EU Member States from inspecting aircraft from other EU Member States. EU Member States were provided with a transition period of two years for transposing and implementing the above-mentioned Directive.Until 2006, the operational elements of the SAFA Programme were implemented by the Central Joint Aviation Authorities (CJAA). At the end of 2006, the SAFA coordination activities, including the centralised database, have been transferred from CJAA to EASA.As of 1 January 2007, following a decision by the Directors General of ECAC Member States, the SAFA Programme was transferred under European Community (EC) competence and the responsibility for the management and further development of the EU SAFA Programme falls upon the European Commission assisted by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).The continued participation of the 15 non-EU ECAC Member States, and thus the pan-European dimension of the programme, has been assured through the signature of Working Arrangements between each of these individual States and EASA.In the last 4 years, similar Working Arrangements have been signed with several non-European States (Morocco, United Arab Emirates, Canada, Singapore and Israel) and a further non-EU ECAC Member State (Montenegro).On 28 October 2012, the Implementing Rules on Air Operations entered into force as the new legal basis for the EU ramp inspection programme, replacing the original system established by the SAFA Directive and its implementing regulations with a new system represented by the new EU Ramp Inspections Programme.The EU Ramp Inspection Programme is a European Programme regarding the performance of ramp inspections on aircraft used by third country operators (SAFA) or used by operators under the regulatory oversight of another EU Member State (SACA).The Programme is regulated by Commission Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 and it provides for the inspection of aircraft suspected (based on e.g. safety relevant information collected by the Participating States or on regular analysis of the centralised database performed by EASA) of non-compliance with the applicable requirements (either international safety standards or EU standards). Ramp inspections may also be carried out in the absence of any suspicion, in this case a spot-check procedure is being used.The applicable legal framework of the Programme contains the following:Commission Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 of 5 October 2012;Acceptable Means of Compliance (AMC) and Guidance Material (GM) to Part-ARO, consolidated version, issue 3, 28 July 2014; andInspection Instructions on the Categorisation of Ramp Inspection (SAFA/SACA) Findings – INST.RI.01/002 approved on 18 November 2015. The EU Ramp Inspection Programme has replaced the EU SAFA Programme and has two major components:SAFA ramp inspections (for third country operators); andSACA ramp inspections (for community operators – checked against EU standards). In each Participating State, aircraft of operators under the safety oversight of another Member State or of a third country can be subject to a ramp inspection, chiefly concerned with the aircraft documents and manuals, flight crew licenses, the apparent condition of the aircraft and the presence and condition of mandatory cabin safety equipment. The applicable requirements for these inspections are:The ICAO international standards for aircraft used by third country operators;The relevant EU requirements for aircraft used by operators under the regulatory oversight of another Member State;Manufacturers’ standards when checking the technical condition of the aircraft; andPublished national standards (e.g. Aeronautical Information Publications (AIPs)) that are declared applicable to all operators flying to that State. These checks are carried out in accordance with a procedure which is common to all the Participating States. Their outcome is then subject to reports which also follow a common format.In case of significant irregularities, the operator and the appropriate Aviation Authority (State of Operator or State of Registry) are contacted in order to arrive at corrective measures to be taken not only with regard to the aircraft inspected, but also with regard to other aircraft which could be concerned in the case of an irregularity which is of a generic nature. All data from the reports as well as supplementary information are shared and centralised in a computerised database set up and managed by EASA.The main features of the EU Ramp Inspection Programme can be summarised as follows:its application by all Participating States – notably all ECAC States (EU Member States, non-EU ECAC States as well as non-EU States that have signed the EASA Working Arrangements);the broad dissemination of inspection results through a centralised database;its bottom-up approach: the programme is built around ramp inspections of aircraft;non-discriminatory approach: obligation for the participating EU Member States, that in addition to third country aircraft, to inspect EU aircraft as well, on the basis of the EU requirements; The 47 Participating States engaged in the EU Ramp Inspections Programme are: Albania, Armenia, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Republic of Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, Morocco, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Singapore, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Turkey, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates and United Kingdom.However, ramp inspections are limited to on-the-spot assessments and cannot substitute for proper regulatory oversight, thus, they cannot guarantee the airworthiness of a particular aircraft. Where irregularities have an immediate impact on safety, inspectors can demand corrective actions before they allow the aircraft to leave.StakeholdersThe European Commission and Participating States are informed of any potentially safety hazards identified. They come together with EASA and Eurocontrol regularly in the Air Safety Committee meetings (ASC) and the Ramp Inspections Coordination and Standardisation (RICS) meetings. As of 2010, EASA is also organising yearly the IndustryRegulators Forum in Cologne, whereby states and aviation industry representatives meet to discuss issues of common interest in the ramp inspections area.EASA’s role in the EU Ramp Inspections ProgrammeEASA is responsible for coordinating the RAMP inspections programme. The specific role and responsibilities of EASA in the EU Ramp Inspections Programme are:to collect by means of a centralised database the inspection reports of the Participating States engaged in the EU Ramp Inspections Programme;to develop, maintain and continuously update the centralised database;to provide necessary changes and enhancements to the database application;analyse all relevant information concerning the safety of aircraft and its operators;to report potential aviation safety problems to European Commission and all the Participating States;to advise the European Commission and all the Participating States on follow-up actions;to propose coordinated actions to the commission and to the competent authorities, when necessary on safety grounds, and ensure coordination at the technical level of such actions;to liaise with other European institutions and bodies, international organisations and third country competent authorities on information exchange.National CoordinatorsNational coordinators have been appointed by the competent authorities of all the Participating States. The main role of a national coordinator is to ensure the day-today coordination of the programme at national level in order to facilitate the appropriate implementation of the programme.The specific tasks ofa national coordinator should include the following:entering ramp inspection reports into the centralised database;prioritising ramp inspections in accordance with the applicable provisions;nominating national representatives for the ramp inspection working groups;acting as a focal point for the training schedules (initial and recurrent training) for all involved national ramp inspection staff;ensuring that all staff involved in ramp inspections are properly trained and scheduled for recurrent training;representing the Member State at the meetings of the Ramp Inspections Coordination and Standardisation group (RICS) on ramp inspections;promoting and implementing the inspector exchange programme;providing support in handling requests for disclosure of data;ensuring distribution of new legislation and latest versions of procedures to ramp inspection staff;organising regular meetings with all ramp inspection staff to maintain a high quality standard;implementing a national ramp inspection quality control system;managing the access of national operators and the competent authority's staff to the centralised database;act as a sectorial focal point in the domain of ramp inspections in the context of standardisation activities performed by the Agency;proposing appropriate team members for ramp inspection standardisation visits;provide information to the Agency, the Commission and the Member States on contacts with authorities and operators.Member StatesThe 47 Participating States engaged in the EU Ramp Inspections Programme are: Albania, Armenia, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Republic of Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, Morocco, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Singapore, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Turkey, Ukraine, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and United Kingdom.See alsoEuropean Aviation Safety AgencyEuropean Civil Aviation ConferenceJoint Aviation AuthoritiesList of air carriers banned in the EUExternal links in Europe Aviation safety", "machine_text": "SAFA Programme The South African Football Association (SAFA) Football Development Programme, known as the SAFA Programme, is an initiative aimed at developing professional soccer players in South Africa.

The show was produced by Rex Carlton, and ran for 39 episodes on the CBS network. The series starred Rex Reason as Adam MacLean, a World War II veteran who wandered the American West without a gun. The premise of the show was unique for its time, as most Westerns of the era depicted rugged, gun-toting heroes. But in Man Without a Gun, MacLean relied on his wits and his fists to solve problems, often putting himself in danger to help others. The show was set in the town of Yellowstone, which was plagued by various troubles, from lawlessness to disputes over land and water. MacLean, who had a knack for conflict resolution, became the town's unofficial problem solver, using his intelligence and moral compass to bring peace to Yellowstone. The character of MacLean, portrayed by Rex Reason, was no typical Western hero. He was a veteran of the war who had seen enough violence and death to know that guns weren't always the answer. He was a man of honor and integrity, who saw the value of human life and refused to take it unless absolutely necessary. Man Without a Gun garnered a loyal fanbase during its two-year run, but was ultimately cancelled due to poor ratings. However, the show's legacy lives on, as it was one of the first Westerns to portray a hero who relied on his intellect and ethics instead of his firearm. It has been praised for its unique approach to the genre, and for paving the way for later Westerns that explored similar themes. In conclusion, Man Without a Gun was a groundbreaking television show that defied the conventions of the Western genre. Its protagonist was a symbol of peace and diplomacy, who managed to resolve conflicts without resorting to violence. The show remains a cult classic and an important milestone in the evolution of Westerns on television.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 6848807}

As of November 2020 the mine developer, Northern Dynasty Minerals, was seeking federal permits from the United States Coast Guard and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. State permitting would then follow, which the developer expected to take up to three years. In November 2020, the developer was denied a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) permit for its proposed mine discharge plan. On September 9, 2021, it was reported that the EPA had 'asked a federal court to allow for Clean Water Act protections for parts of the bay.'BackgroundGeographyThe Pebble prospect is in a remote, wild, and generally uninhabited part of the Bristol Bay watershed. The nearest communities, aboutdistant, are the villages of Nondalton, Newhalen, and Iliamna. The site issouthwest of Anchorage, Alaska.Pebble is approximatelynorth of, and upstream of, Lake Iliamna. The deposit area is characterized by relatively flat land dotted by glacial ponds, interspersed with isolated mountains or ranges of hills rising one or two thousand feet above the flats. Pebble is under a broad flat valley at aboutabove sea level dividing the drainages of Upper Talarik Creek and the Koktuli River.Upper Talarik Creek flows into Lake Iliamna, which flows through the Kvichak River into Bristol Bay. Waters in the Koktuli River drain into the Mulchatna River, a tributary of the Nushagak River which empties into Bristol Bay at Dillingham. Water from Lake Clark, approximatelyeast of Pebble, flows down the Newhalen River to Lake Iliamna.GeologyRegionalThe Kahiltna terrane is interpreted to represent a sediment trough formed on the landward (Alaska) side of the Wrangellia volcanic arc terrane, prior to collision of Wrangellia with Alaska. The Wrangellia and Kahiltna terranes docked to Alaska in the Cretaceous Period. This part of the Kahiltna terrane is dominated by Late Triassic basalt, andesite and sedimentary rocks overlain by Jurassic-Cretaceous andesitic turbidites. Cretaceous granitic intrusive activity was widespread in the Kahiltna terrane. Tertiary volcanic and sedimentary rocks, and Quaternary glacial deposits, developed over the older rocks.The Lake Clark fault, or a splay, probably lies withinof the Pebble deposits and possibly much closer. The fault is a major right-lateral strike-slip crustal feature, considered to be a westward expression of the Castle Mountain fault. The actual ground trace of the fault and its splays are unknown in the Pebble area, due to extensive ground cover. A 2007 report indicates that magnitude 7.1 quakes occur on the fault on a 700-year cycle. The Lake Clark fault several hundred miles to the north is sub-parallel to the Denali fault and considered to be of similar nature. A magnitude 7.9 quake struck the Denali fault in 2002. The subduction zone of the Aleutian Trench lies approximatelysouth of Pebble. This zone was the source of the 1964 Good Friday earthquake of magnitude 9.2. The Augustine Volcano, which lies 25 miles offshore, last erupted in 2006.The ore bodyA contiguous body of ore is known as Pebble West where mineralization locally extends to the surface and as Pebble East where it is deeply buried. Pebble holds mostly low-grade ore, requiring a large-scale operation to economically recover it.The Pebble deposit is hosted in porphyritic granodiorite to tonalite of Upper Cretaceous age intruded into deformed sedimentary rocks of the Jurassic to Cretaceous Kahiltna flysch terrane.The copper ore is a calc-alkali porphyry copper-gold-molybdenum deposit. The ore body extends from the surface to at leastdepth. In the western part of the orebody, mineralization occurs in a complex of several small granodiorite cupolas, diorite sills, older intrusions, breccias, and sediments. The western part of the deposit is locally exposed at the surface; thin gossans are developed and oxidation reachesin depth. The orebody extends eastward across a fault contact, at depth. East of the fault mineralization occurs in abundant sills and in the intruded sediments. Farther east, and deeper, the sills coalesce into a deeply buried granodiorite pluton. Mineralization and ore continue into the pluton. The eastern part of the deposit was eroded when it was exposed at the surface millions of years ago. It has since been buried by a thickening-to-the-east wedge of post-mineralization-age Tertiary sedimentary and volcanic sedimentary rocks.Mineralization at Pebble is aged from 90.4 ±0.6 MYA to 89.5 ±0.3 MYA.Metallic minerals identified at Pebble include pyrite, chalcopyrite, molybdenite, and bornite, along with minor covellite, chalcocite, digenite and magnetite.ResourcesIn 2008, Pebble was estimated to be the second-largest ore deposit of its type in the world in terms of the value of the contained metal, slightly smaller than Indonesia's Grasberg Mine, which contains more metal in a smaller amount of ore than Pebble.The last resource estimate for Pebble, as at December 2017, was a measured and indicated resource of 6.46 billion tonnes of ore grading 0.40", "machine_text": "Pebble Mine is a controversial proposed copper and gold mine located in southwest Alaska. The project was first introduced in 2001 by the Canadian mining company Northern Dynasty Minerals, but has faced opposition from environmentalists and local communities. The Pebble Mine project aims to extract copper, gold, and molybdenum from the Pebble deposit, one of the largest undeveloped mineral resources in the world. The mine’s proposed site is located near Bristol Bay, home to the world’s largest sockeye salmon fishery, as well as numerous other fish and wildlife species. Opponents of the Pebble Mine project argue that it poses a significant threat to the ecosystem of Bristol Bay, as mining can potentially contaminate waterways with toxic substances such as mercury and arsenic. These substances can harm fish and wildlife populations, threaten the livelihoods of local fishers, and endanger the food security of Indigenous communities. In 2014, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released a scientific study that found the Pebble Mine project would pose significant risks to the Bristol Bay watershed. The study was met with mixed reactions, with some praising the EPA for its thorough analysis and others criticizing it for overreaching its regulatory authority. In 2019, Northern Dynasty submitted a permit application to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for the Pebble Mine project. The proposal sparked renewed opposition from environmental groups, Indigenous communities, and even major corporations such as TiffanyCo. and the outdoor retailer Patagonia. Despite ongoing opposition, the Trump administration’s EPA granted a permit for the Pebble Mine project in late 2020, a decision that was widely criticized as rushed and politically motivated. The Biden administration has since announced that it would review the permit and has expressed concerns about the potential impacts of the mine on Bristol Bay. The Pebble Mine project remains a highly contentious issue, with both its proponents and opponents making arguments based on economic, environmental, and cultural factors.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 8796651}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Track and field\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Track and field is a sport that includes athletic contests based on running, jumping, and throwing skills. The name is derived from where the sport takes place, a running track and a grass field for the throwing and some of the jumping events. Track and field is categorized under the umbrella sport of athletics, which also includes road running, cross country running, and racewalking.The foot racing events, which include sprints, middle- and long-distance events, racewalking, and hurdling, are won by the athlete who completes it in the least time. The jumping and throwing events are won by those who achieve the greatest distance or height. Regular jumping events include long jump, triple jump, high jump, and pole vault, while the most common throwing events are shot put, javelin, discus, and hammer. There are also 'combined events' or 'multi events', such as the pentathlon consisting of five events, heptathlon consisting of seven events, and decathlon consisting of ten events. In these, athletes participate in a combination of track and field events. Most track and field events are individual sports with a single victor; the most prominent team events are relay races, which typically feature teams of four. Events are almost exclusively divided by gender, although both the men's and women's competitions are usually held at the same venue. Recently, “mixed” relay events have been introduced into meets, whereby two men and two women make up the four-person team. If a race has too many people to run all at once, preliminary heats will be run to narrow down the field of participants.Track and field is one of the oldest sports. In ancient times, it was an event held in conjunction with festivals and sports meets such as the Ancient Olympic Games in Greece. In modern times, the two most prestigious international track and field competitions are the athletics competition at the Olympic Games and the World Athletics Championships. World Athletics, formerly known as the International Association of Athletics Federations, is the international governing body for the sport of athletics.Records are kept of the best performances in specific events, at world, continental, and national levels, right down to a personal level. However, if athletes are deemed to have violated the event's rules or regulations, they are disqualified from the competition and their marks are erased.In the United States, the term track and field may refer to other athletics events, such as cross country, the marathon, and road running, rather than strictly track-based events.HistoryThe sport of track and field has its roots in human prehistory. Track and field style events are among the oldest of all sporting competitions, as running, jumping and throwing are natural and universal forms of human physical expression. The first recorded examples of organized track and field events at a sports festival are the Ancient Olympic Games. At the first Games in 776 BC in Olympia, Greece, only one event was contested: the stadion footrace. The scope of the Games expanded in later years to include further running competitions, but the introduction of the Ancient Olympic pentathlon marked a step towards track and field as it is recognized today—it comprised a five-event competition of the long jump, javelin throw, discus throw, stadion footrace, and wrestling.Track and field events were also present at the Panhellenic Games in Greece around this period, and they spread to Rome in Italy around 200 BC. After the period of Classical antiquity (in which the sport was largely Greco-Roman influenced) new track and field events began developing in parts of Northern Europe in the Middle Ages. The stone put and weight throw competitions popular among Celtic societies in Ireland and Scotland were precursors to the modern shot put and hammer throw events. One of the last track and field events to develop was the pole vault, which stemmed from competitions such as the Fierljeppen contests in the Northern European Lowlands in the 18th century.Discrete modern track and field competitions, separate from general sporting festivals, were first recorded in the 19th century. These were typically organised by educational institutions, military organisations and sports clubs as competitions between rival establishments. Competitions in the English public schools were conceived as human equivalents of horse racing, fox hunting and hare coursing, influenced by a Classics-rich curriculum. The Royal Shrewsbury School Hunt is the oldest running club in the world, with written records going back to 1831 and evidence that it was established by 1819. The school organised Paper Chase races in which runners followed a trail of paper shreds left by two 'foxes'; even today RSSH runners are called 'hounds' and a race victory is a 'kill'. The first definite record of Shrewsbury's (cross-country) Annual Steeplechase is in 1834, making it the oldest running race of the modern era. The school also lays claim to the oldest track and field meeting still in existence, originating in the Second Spring Meeting first documented in 1840. This featured a series of throwing and jumping events with mock horse races including the Derby Stakes, the Hurdle Race and the Trial Stakes. Runners were entered by 'owners' and named as though they were horses.away and a decade later, the first Wenlock Olympian Games were held at Much Wenlock racecourse. Events at the 1851 Wenlock Games included a 'half-mile foot race' (805 m) and a 'leaping in distance' competition.In 1865, Dr William Penny Brookes of Wenlock helped set up the National Olympian Association, which held their first Olympian Games in 1866 at The Crystal Palace in London. This national event was a great success, attracting a crowd of over ten thousand people.In response, that same year the Amateur Athletic Club was formed and held a championship for 'gentlemen amateurs' in an attempt to reclaim the sport for the educated elite. Ultimately the 'allcomers' ethos of the NOA won through and the AAC was reconstituted as the Amateur Athletic Association in 1880, the first national body for the sport of athletics. The AAA Championships, the de facto British national championships despite being for England only, have been held annually since 3 July 1880 with breaks only during two world wars and 2006–2008. The AAA was effectively a global governing body in the early years of the sport, codifying its rules for the first time.Meanwhile, the United States began holding an annual national competition—the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships—first held in 1876 by the New York Athletic Club. The establishment of general sports governing bodies for the United States (the Amateur Athletic Union in 1888) and France (the Union des sociétés françaises de sports athlétiques in 1889) put the sport on a formal footing and meant that international competitions became possible.The establishment of the modern Olympic Games at the end of the 19th century marked a new high for track and field. The Olympic athletics programme, comprising track and field events plus a marathon race, contained many of the foremost sporting competitions of the 1896 Summer Olympics. The Olympics also consolidated the use of metric measurements in international track and field events, both for race distances and for measuring jumps and throws. The Olympic athletics programme greatly expanded over the next decades, and track and field contests remained among the Games' most prominent. The Olympics was the elite competition for track and field, and only amateur sportsmen could compete. Track and field continued to be a largely amateur sport, as this rule was strictly enforced: Jim Thorpe was stripped of his track and field medals from the 1912 Olympics after it was revealed that he had taken expense money for playing baseball, violating Olympic amateurism rules, before the 1912 Games. His medals were reinstated 29 years after his death.That same year, the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) was established, becoming the international governing body for track and field, and it enshrined amateurism as one of its founding principles for the sport. The National Collegiate Athletic Association held their first Men's Outdoor Track and Field Championship in 1921, making it one of the most prestigious competitions for students, and this was soon followed by the introduction of track and field at the inaugural World Student Games in 1923. The first continental track and field competition was the 1919 South American Championships, which was followed by the European Athletics Championships in 1934.Up until the early 1920s, track and field had been almost exclusively a male-only pursuit. Alice Milliat argued for the inclusion of women at the Olympics, but the International Olympic Committee refused. She founded the International Women's Sports Federation in 1921 and, alongside a growing women's sports movement in Europe and North America, the group initiated of the Women's Olympiad (held annually from 1921 to 1923). Working in conjunction with the English Women's Amateur Athletic Association (WAAA), the Women's World Games was held four times between 1922 and 1934, as well as a Women's International and British Games in London in 1924. These events ultimately led to the introduction of five track and field events for women in the athletics at the 1928 Summer Olympics. In China, women's track and field events were being held in the 1920s, but were subject to criticism and disrespect from audiences. National women's events were established in this period, with 1923 seeing the First British TrackField championships for women and the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) sponsoring the First American TrackField championships for women. Also in 1923, physical education advocate Zhang Ruizhen called for greater equality and participation of women in Chinese track and field. The rise of Kinue Hitomi and her 1928 Olympic medal for Japan signified the growth of women's track and field in East Asia. More women's events were gradually introduced as years progressed (although it was only towards the end of the century that the men's and women's programmes approached parity of events). Marking an increasingly inclusive approach to the sport, major track and field competitions for disabled athletes were first introduced at the 1960 Summer Paralympics.With the rise of numerous regional championships, as well as the growth in Olympic-style multi-sport events (such as the Commonwealth Games and the Pan-American Games), competitions between international track and field athletes became widespread. From the 1960s onwards, the sport gained more exposure and commercial appeal through television coverage and the increasing wealth of nations. After over half a century of amateurism, the amateur status of the sport began to be displaced by growing professionalism in the late 1970s. As a result, the Amateur Athletic Union was dissolved in the United States and it was replaced with a non-amateur body solely focused on the sport of athletics: The Athletics Congress (later USA Track and Field). The IAAF abandoned amateurism in 1982 and later removed all references to it from its name by rebranding itself as the International Association of Athletics Federations. While Western countries were limited to amateurs until the early 1980s, Soviet Bloc countries always fielded state-funded athletes who trained full-time, putting American and Western European athletes at a significant disadvantage. 1983 saw the establishment of the IAAF World Championships in Athletics—the first-ever global competition just for athletics—which, with the Olympics, became one of track and field's most prestigious competitions.The profile of the sport reached a new high in the 1980s, with a number of athletes becoming household names (such as Carl Lewis, Sergey Bubka, Sebastian Coe, Zola Budd and Florence Griffith Joyner). Many world records were broken in this period, and the added political element between competitors of the United States, East Germany, and the Soviet Union, in reaction to the Cold War, only served to stoke the sport's popularity. The increase in the commercial capacity of track and field was also met with developments in the application of sports science, and there were many changes to coaching methods, athlete's diet regimes, training facilities, and sports equipment. This was also accompanied by an increase in the use of performance-enhancing drugs. State-sponsored doping in 1970s and 1980s East Germany, China, the Soviet Union, and early 21st century Russia, as well as prominent individual cases such as those of Olympic gold medallists Ben Johnson and Marion Jones, damaged the public image and marketability of the sport.From the 1990s onwards, track and field became increasingly more professional and international, as the IAAF gained over two hundred member nations. The IAAF World Championships in Athletics became a fully professional competition with the introduction of prize money in 1997, and in 1998 the IAAF Golden League—an annual series of major track and field meetings in Europe—provided a higher level of economic incentive in the form of a US1 million jackpot. In 2010, the series was replaced by the more lucrative IAAF Diamond League, a fourteen-meeting series held in Europe, Asia, North America, and the Middle East—the first-ever worldwide annual series of track and field meetings.EventsTrack and field events are divided into three broad categories: track events, field events, and combined events. The majority of athletes tend to specialize in just one event (or event type) with the aim of perfecting their performances, although the aim of combined events athletes is to become proficient in a number of disciplines. Track events involve running on a track over specified distances, and—in the case of the hurdling and steeplechase events—obstacles may be placed on the track. There are also relay races in which teams of athletes run and pass on a baton to their team members at the end of a certain distance.There are two types of field events: jumps and throws. In jumping competitions, athletes are judged on either the length or height of their jumps. The performances of jumping events for distance are measured from a board or marker, and any athlete overstepping this mark is judged to have fouled. In the jumps for height, an athlete must clear their body over a crossbar without knocking the bar off the supporting standards. The majority of jumping events are unaided, although athletes propel themselves vertically with purpose-built sticks in the pole vault.The throwing events involve hurling an implement (such as a heavyweight, javelin, or discus) from a set point, with athletes being judged on the distance that the object is thrown. Combined events involve the same group of athletes contesting a number of different track and field events. Points are given for their performance in each event and the athlete and/or team with the greatest points total at the end of all events is the winner.TrackSprintsRaces over short distances, or sprints, are among the oldest running competitions. The first 13 editions of the Ancient Olympic Games featured only one event, the stadion race, which was a race from one end of the stadium to the other. Sprinting events are focused on athletes reaching and sustaining their quickest possible running speed. Three sprinting events are currently held at the Olympics and outdoor World Championships: the 100 metres, 200 metres, and 400 metres. These events have their roots in races of imperial measurements that later changed to metric: the 100 m evolved from the 100-yard dash, the 200 m distances came from the furlong (or 1/8 of a mile), and the 400 m was the successor to the 440 yard dash or quarter-mile race.At the professional level, sprinters begin the race by assuming a crouching position in the starting blocks before leaning forward and gradually moving into an upright position as the race progresses and momentum is gained. Athletes remain in the same lane on the running track throughout all sprinting events, with the sole exception of the 400 m indoors. Races up to 100 m are largely focused upon acceleration to an athlete's maximum speed. All sprints beyond this distance increasingly incorporate an element of endurance. Human physiology dictates that a runner's near-top speed cannot be maintained for more than thirty seconds or so because lactic acid builds up once leg muscles begin to suffer oxygen deprivation.Top speed can only be maintained for up to 20 metres.The 60 metres is a common indoor event and indoor world championship event. Less-common events include the 50 metres, 55 metres, 300 metres, and 500 metres, which are run in some high school and collegiate competitions in the United States. The 150 metres, though rarely competed, has a star-studded history: Pietro Mennea set a world best in 1983, Olympic champions Michael Johnson and Donovan Bailey went head-to-head over the distance in 1997, and Usain Bolt improved Mennea's record in 2009.Middle distanceThe most common middle-distance track events are the 800 metres, 1500 metres and mile run, although the 3000 metres may also be classified as a middle-distance event. The 880 yard run, or half mile, was the forebear of the 800 m distance and it has its roots in competitions in the United Kingdom in the 1830s. The 1500 m came about as a result of running three laps of a 500 m track, which was commonplace in continental Europe in the 20th century.Runners start the race from a standing position along a curved starting line and after hearing the starting pistol they head towards the innermost track to follow the quickest route to the finish. In 800 m races athletes begin at a staggered starting point before the turn in the track and they must remain in their lanes for the first 100 m of the race. This rule was introduced to reduce the amount of physical jostling between runners in the early stages of the race. Physiologically, these middle-distance events demand that athletes have good aerobic and anaerobic energy producing systems, and also that they have strong speed endurance.The 1500 m and mile run events have historically been some of the most prestigious track and field events. Swedish rivals Gunder Hägg and Arne Andersson broke each other's 1500 m and mile world records on a number of occasions in the 1940s. The prominence of the distances were maintained by Roger Bannister, who (in 1954) was the first to run the long-elusive four-minute mile, and Jim Ryun's exploits served to popularise interval training. Races between British rivals Sebastian Coe, Steve Ovett and Steve Cram characterised middle-distance running in the 1980s. From the 1990s onwards, North Africans such as Noureddine Morceli of Algeria and Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco came to dominate the 1500 and mile events.Beyond the short distances of sprinting events, factors such as an athlete's reactions and top speed becomes less important, while qualities such as pace, race tactics and endurance become more so.Long-distanceThere are three common long-distance running events in track and field competitions: 3000 metres, 5000 metres and 10,000 metres. The latter two races are both Olympic and World Championship events outdoors, while the 3000 m is held at the IAAF World Indoor Championships. The 5000 m and 10,000 m events have their historical roots in the 3-mile and 6-mile races. The 3000 m was historically used as a women's long-distance event, entering the World Championship programme in 1983 and Olympic programme in 1984, but this was abandoned in favour of a women's 5000 m event in 1995.Marathons, while long-distance races, are typically run on street courses, and often are run separately from other track and field events.In terms of competition rules and physical demands, long-distance track races have much in common with middle-distance races, except that pacing, stamina, and race tactics become much greater factors in performances. However, a number of athletes have achieved success in both middle- and long-distance events, including Saïd Aouita who set world records from 1500 m to 5000 m. The use of pace-setters in long-distance events is very common at the elite level, although they are not present at championship level competitions as all qualified competitors want to win.The long-distance track events gained popularity in the 1920s by the achievements of the 'Flying Finns', such as multiple Olympic champion Paavo Nurmi. The successes of Emil Zátopek in the 1950s promoted intense interval training methods, but Ron Clarke's world record-breaking feats established the importance of natural training and even-paced running. The 1990s saw the rise of North and East African runners in long-distance events. Kenyan and Ethiopian athletes, in particular, have since remained dominant in these events.Relay racesRelay races are the only track and field event in which a team of runners directly compete against other teams. Typically, a team is made up of four runners of the same sex. Each runner completes their specified distance (referred to as a leg) before handing over a baton to a teammate, who then begins their leg upon receiving the baton. There is usually a designated area where athletes must exchange the baton. Teams may be disqualified if they fail to complete the change within the area, or if the baton is dropped during the race. A team may also be disqualified if its runners are deemed to have wilfully impeded other competitors.Relay races emerged in the United States in the 1880s as a variation on charity races between firemen, who would hand a red pennant on to teammates every 300 yards. There are two very common relay events: the 4×100 metres relay and the 4×400 metres relay. Both events entered the Olympic programme at the 1912 Summer Games after a one-off men's medley relay featured in 1908 Olympics. The 4 × 100 m event is run strictly within the same lane on the track, meaning that the team collectively runs one complete circuit of the track. Teams in a 4 × 400 m event remain in their own lane until the runner of the second leg passes the first bend, at which point runners can leave their lanes and head towards the inner-most part of the circuit. For the second and third baton change overs, teammates must align themselves in respect of their team position – leading teams take the inner lanes while teammates of the slower teams must await the baton on outer lanes.The Shuttle Hurdle Relay per Hurdling web page: In a shuttle hurdle relay, each of four hurdlers on a team runs the opposite direction from the preceding runner. No batons are used for this particular relay.The IAAF keeps world records for five different types of track relays. As with 4×100 m and 4×400 m events, all races comprise teams of four athletes running the same distances, with the less commonly contested distances being the 4×200 m, 4×800 m and 4×1500 m relays. Other events include the distance medley relay (comprising legs of 1200 m, 400 m, 800 m, and 1600 m), which is frequently held in the United States, and a sprint relay, known as the Swedish medley relay, which is popular in Scandinavia and was held at the IAAF World Youth Championships in Athletics programme. Relay events have significant participation in the United States, where a number of large meetings (or relay carnivals) are focused almost exclusively on relay events.HurdlingRaces with hurdles as obstacles were first popularised in the 19th century in England. The first known event, held in 1830, was a variation of the 100-yard dash that included heavy wooden barriers as obstacles. A competition between the Oxford and Cambridge Athletic Clubs in 1864 refined this, holding a 120-yard race (110 m) with ten hurdles of 3-foot and 6 inches (1.06 m) in height (each placed 10 yards (9 m) apart), with the first and final hurdles 15 yards from the start and finish, respectively. French organisers adapted the race into metric (adding 28 cm) and the basics of this race, the men's 110 metres hurdles, has remained largely unchanged. The origin of the 400 metres hurdles also lies in Oxford, where (around 1860) a competition was held over 440 yards and twelve 1.06 m high wooden barriers were placed along the course. The modern regulations stem from the 1900 Summer Olympics: the distance was fixed to 400 m while ten 3-foot (91.44 cm) hurdles were placed 35 m apart on the track, with the first and final hurdles being 45 m and 40 m away from the start and finish, respectively. Women's hurdles are slightly lower at 84 cm (2 ft 9 in) for the 100 m event and 76 cm (2 ft 6 in) for the 400 m event.By far the most common events are the 100 metres hurdles for women, 110 m hurdles for men and 400 m hurdles for both sexes. The men's 110 m has been featured at every modern Summer Olympics while the men's 400 m was introduced in the second edition of the Games. Women's initially competed in the 80 metres hurdles event, which entered the Olympic programme in 1932. This was extended to the 100 m hurdles at the 1972 Olympics, but it was not until 1984 that a women's 400 m hurdles event took place at the Olympics (having been introduced at the 1983 World Championships in Athletics the previous year).Other distances and heights of hurdles, such as the 200 metres hurdles and low hurdles, were once common but are now held infrequently.The 300 metres hurdles is run in some levels of American competition.Outside of the hurdles events, the steeplechase race is the other track and field event with obstacles. Just as the hurdling events, the steeplechase finds its origin in student competition in Oxford, England. However, this event was born as a human variation on the original steeplechase competition found in horse racing. A steeplechase event was held on a track for the 1879 English championships and the 1900 Summer Olympics featured men's 2500 m and 4000 m steeplechase races. The event was held over various distances until the 1920 Summer Olympics marked the rise of the 3000 metres steeplechase as the standard event. The IAAF set the standards of the event in 1954, and the event is held on a 400 m circuit that includes a water jump on each lap. Despite the long history of men's steeplechase in track and field, the women's steeplechase only gained World Championship status in 2005, with its first Olympic appearance in 2008.FieldJumpingLong jumpThe long jump is one of the oldest track and field events, having its roots as one of the events within the ancient Greek pentathlon contest. The athletes would take a short run up and jump into an area of dug up earth, with the winner being the one who jumped farthest. Small weights (Halteres) were held in each hand during the jump then swung back and dropped near the end to gain extra momentum and distance. The modern long jump, standardised in England and the United States around 1860, bears resemblance to the ancient event although no weights are used. Athletes sprint along a length of track that leads to a jumping board and a sandpit. The athletes must jump before a marked line and their achieved distance is measured from the nearest point of sand disturbed by the athlete's body.The athletics competition at the first Olympics featured a men's long jump competition and a women's competition was introduced at the 1948 Summer Olympics. Professional long jumpers typically have strong acceleration and sprinting abilities. However, athletes must also have a consistent stride to allow them to take off near the board while still maintaining their maximum speed. In addition to the traditional long jump, a standing long jump contest exists which requires that athletes leap from a static position without a run-up. A men's version of this event featured on the Olympic programme from 1900 to 1912.Triple jumpSimilar to the long jump, the triple jump takes place on a track heading towards a sandpit. Originally, athletes would hop on the same leg twice before jumping into the pit, but this was changed to the current 'hop, step and jump' pattern from 1900 onwards. There is some dispute over whether the triple jump was contested in ancient Greece: while some historians claim that a contest of three jumps occurred at Ancient Games, others such as Stephen G. Miller believe this is incorrect, suggesting that the belief stems from a mythologised account of Phayllus of Croton having jumped 55 ancient feet (around 16.3 m). The Book of Leinster, a 12th-century Irish manuscript, records the existence of geal-ruith (triple jump) contests at the Tailteann Games.The men's triple jump competition has been ever-present at the modern Olympics, but it was not until 1993 that a women's version gained World Championship status and went on to have its first Olympic appearance three years later. The men's standing triple jump event featured at the Olympics in 1900 and 1904, but such competitions have since become very uncommon, although it is still used as a non-competitive exercise drill. The Current world record for the Men's triple jump is 18.29 meter (60 ft 0in) held by Jonathan Edwards. The current women's world record is 15.67 meters (51 ft 4 3/4in) held by Yulimar Rojas.High jumpThe first recorded instances of high jumping competitions were in Scotland in the 19th century. Further competitions were organised in 1840 in England and in 1865 the basic rules of the modern event were standardised there. Athletes have a short run up and then take off from one foot to jump over a horizontal bar and fall back onto a cushioned landing area. The men's high jump was included in the 1896 Olympics and a women's competition followed in 1928.Jumping technique has played a significant part in the history of the event. High jumpers typically cleared the bar feet first in the late 19th century, using either the Scissors, Eastern cut-off or Western roll technique. The straddle technique became prominent in the mid-20th century, but Dick Fosbury overturned tradition by pioneering a backwards and head-first technique in the late 1960s – the Fosbury Flop – which won him the gold at the 1968 Olympics. This technique has become the overwhelming standard for the sport from the 1980s onwards. The standing high jump was contested at the Olympics from 1900 to 1912, but is now relatively uncommon outside of its use as an exercise drill.Pole vaultIn terms of sport, the use of poles for vaulting distances was recorded in Fierljeppen contests in the Frisian area of Europe, and vaulting for height was seen at gymnastics competitions in Germany in the 1770s. One of the earliest recorded pole vault competitions was in Cumbria, England in 1843. The basic rules and technique of the event originated in the United States. The rules required that athletes do not move their hands along the pole and athletes began clearing the bar with their feet first and twisting so that the stomach faces the bar. Bamboo poles were introduced in the 20th century and a metal box in the runway for planting the pole became standard. Landing mattresses were introduced in the mid-20th century to protect the athletes who were clearing increasingly greater heights.The modern event sees athletes run down a strip of track, plant the pole in the metal box, and vault over the horizontal bar before letting go of the pole and falling backwards onto the landing mattress. While earlier versions used wooden, metal or bamboo, modern poles are generally made from artificial materials such as fibreglass or carbon fibre. The pole vault has been an Olympic event since 1896 for men, but it was over 100 years later that the first women's world championship competition was held at the 1997 IAAF World Indoor Championships. The first women's Olympic pole vaulting competition occurred in 2000.Throwing Track and field contains some of the foremost kinds of throwing sports, and the four major disciplines are the only pure throwing events to feature at the Olympic Games.Shot putThe genesis of the shot put can be traced to pre-historic competitions with rocks: in the Middle ages the stone put was known in Scotland and the steinstossen was recorded in Switzerland. In the 17th century, cannonball throwing competitions within the English military provided a precursor to the modern sport. The term 'shot' originates from the use of round shot-style ammunition for the sport. The modern rules were first laid out in 1860 and required that competitors take legal throws within a square throwing area of seven feet (2.13 m) on each side. This was amended to a circle area with a seven-foot diameter in 1906, and the weight of the shot was standardised to 16 pounds (7.26 kg). Throwing technique was also refined over this period, with bent arm throws being banned as they were deemed too dangerous and the side-step and throw technique arising in the United States in 1876.The shot put has been an Olympic sport for men since 1896 and a women's competition using a 4 kg (8.82 lb) shot was added in 1948. Further throwing techniques have arisen since the post-war era: in the 1950s Parry O'Brien popularised the 180 degree turn and throw technique commonly known as the 'glide', breaking the world record 17 times along the way, while Aleksandr Baryshnikov and Brian Oldfield introduced the 'spin' or rotational technique in 1976.Discus throwIn the discus throw, athletes compete to throw a heavy disc the farthest. In standard competitions, athletes throw the disc from a set circular arc and take turns in a series of throw, with the singular best effort deciding the victor. As one of the events within the ancient pentathlon, the history of the discus throw dates back to 708 BC. In ancient times a heavy circular disc was thrown from a set standing position on a small pedestal, and it was this style that was revived for the 1896 Olympics. This continued until the 1906 Intercalated Games in Athens, which featured both the ancient style and the increasingly popular modern style of turning and throwing. By the 1912 Olympics, the ancient standing throw style had fallen into disuse and contests starting within a 2.5 m squared throwing area became the standard. The discus implement was standardised to 2 kg (4.4 pounds) in weight and 22 cm (8 inches) in diameter in 1907. The women's discus was among the first women's events on the Olympic programme, being introduced in 1928. The first modern athlete to throw the discus while rotating the whole body was Czech athlete František Janda-Suk, who invented the technique when studying the position of the famous statue of Discobolus and won the 1900 Olympic silver medal.Javelin throwAs an implement of war and hunting, javelin throwing began in prehistoric times. Along with the discus, the javelin was the second throwing event in the ancient Olympic pentathlon. Records from 708 BC show two javelin competition types co-existing: throwing at a target and throwing the javelin for distance. It was the latter type from which the modern event derives. In ancient competitions, athletes would wrap an ankyle (thin leather strip) around the javelin that acted as a sling to facilitate extra distance. The javelin throw gained much popularity in Scandinavia in the late 19th century and athletes from the region are still among the most dominant throwers in men's competitions. The modern event features a short run up on a track and then the thrower releases the javelin before the foul line. The runway measures at a minimum of 30m in length, and is covered with the same surface as the track.The first Olympic men's javelin throw contest was held in 1908 and a women's competition was introduced in 1932. The first javelins were made of various types of wood, but in the 1950s, former athlete Bud Held introduced a hollow javelin, then a metal javelin, both of which increased throwers performances. Another former athlete, Miklós Németh invented the rough-tailed javelin and throws reached in excess of 100 m – edging towards the limits of stadia. The distances and the increasing number of horizontal landings led the IAAF to redesign the men's javelin to reduce distance and increase the implement's downward pitching moment to allow for easier measurement. Rough-tailed designs were banned in 1991 and all marks achieved with such javelins were removed from the record books. The women's javelin underwent a similar redesign in 1999. The current javelin specifications are 2.6 to 2.7 m in length and 800 grams in weight for men, and 2.2 to 2.3 m and 600 g for women.Hammer throwThe earliest recorded precursors to the modern hammer throw stem from the Tailteann Games of ancient Ireland, which featured events such as throwing either a weight attached to a rope, a large rock on a wooden handle, or even a chariot wheel on a wooden axle. Other ancient competitions included throwing a cast iron ball attached to a wooden handle – the root of the term 'hammer throw' due to their resemblance to the tools. In 16th century England, contests involving the throwing of actual blacksmith's Sledgehammers were recorded. The hammer implement was standardised in 1887 and the competitions began to resemble the modern event. The weight of the metal ball was set at 16 pounds (7.26 kg) while the attached wire had to measure between 1.175 m and 1.215 m.The men's hammer throw became an Olympic event in 1900 but the women's event – using a 4 kg (8.82 lb) weight – was not widely competed until much later, finally featuring on the women's Olympic programme in 2000. The distances thrown by male athletes became greater from the 1950s onwards as a result of improved equipment using the denser metals, a switch to concrete throwing areas, and more advanced training techniques. Professional hammer throwers were historically large, strong, sturdy athletes. However, qualities such as refined technique, speed and flexibility have become increasingly important in the modern era as the legal throwing area has been reduced from 90 to 34.92 degrees and throwing technique involves three to four controlled rotations.Combined eventsCombined (or multi-discipline) events are competitions in which athletes participate in a number of track and field events, earning points for their performance in each event, which adds to a total points score. Outdoors, the most common combined events are the men's decathlon (ten events) and the women's heptathlon (seven events). Due to stadium limitations, indoor combined events competition have a reduced number of events, resulting in the men's heptathlon and the women's pentathlon. Athletes are allocated points based on an international-standard points scoring system, such as the decathlon scoring table.The Ancient Olympic pentathlon (comprising long jump, javelin, discus, the stadion race and wrestling) was a precursor to the track and field combined events and this ancient event was restored at the 1906 Summer Olympics (Intercalated Games). A men's all-around was held at the 1904 Summer Olympics, contested between five American and two British athletes.StadiumsOutdoorThe term track and field is intertwined with the stadiums that first hosted such competitions. The two basic features of a track and field stadium are the outer oval-shaped running track and an area of turf within this track—the field. In earlier competitions, track lengths varied: the Panathinaiko Stadium measured 333.33 metres at the 1896 Summer Olympics, while at the 1904 Olympics the distance was a third of a mile (536.45 m) at Francis Field. As the sport developed, the IAAF standardised the length to 400 m and stated that the tracks must be split into six to eight running lanes. Precise widths for the lanes were established, as were regulations regarding the curvature of the track. Tracks made of flattened cinders were popular in the early 20th century but synthetic tracks became standard in the late 1960s. 3M's Tartan track (an all-weather running track of polyurethane) gained popularity after its use at the 1968 US Olympic Trials and the 1968 Summer Olympics and it began the process in which synthetic tracks became the standard for the sport. Many track and field stadiums are multi-purpose stadiums, with the running track surrounding a field built for other sports, such as the various types of football.The field of the stadium combines a number of elements for use in the jumping and throwing events. The long jump and triple jump areas comprise a straight, narrow 40-metre running track with a sandpit at one or both ends. Jumps are measured from a take off board—typically a small strip of wood with a plasticine marker attached—which ensures athletes jump from behind the measurement line. The pole vault area is also a 40-metre running track and has an indentation in the ground (the box) where vaulters plant their poles to propel themselves over a crossbar before falling onto cushioned landing mats. The high jump is a stripped-down version of this, with an open area of track or field that leads to a crossbar with a square area of landing mats behind it.The four throwing events generally all begin on one side of the stadium. The javelin throw typically takes place on a piece of track that is central and parallel to the straights of the main running track. The javelin throwing area is a sector shape frequently across the Pitch (sports field) in the middle of the stadium, ensuring that the javelin has a minimal chance of causing damage or injury. The discus throw and hammer throw contests begin in a tall metal cage usually situated in one of the corners of the field. The cage reduces the danger of implements being thrown out of the field of play and throws travel diagonally across the field in the centre of the stadium. The shot put features a circular throwing area with a toe board at one end. The throwing area is a sector. Some stadia also have a water jump area on one side of the field specifically for steeplechase races.Indoor Basic indoor venues may be adapted gymnasiums, which can easily accommodate high jump competitions and short track events. Full-size indoor arenas (i.e. those fully equipped to host all events for the World Indoor Championships) bear similarities with their outdoor equivalents. Typically, a central area is surrounded by a 200-metre oval track with four to eight lanes. The track can be banked at the turns to allow athletes to run around the radius more comfortably. Some have a second running track going straight across the field area, parallel to the straights of the main circuit. This track is used for the 60 metres and 60 metres hurdles events, which are held almost exclusively indoors.Another common adaptation in the United States is a 160-yard track (11 laps to a mile) that fits into a common basketball court-sized arena. This was quite popular when races were held at imperial distances, which gradually was phased out by different organizations in the 1970s and 1980s. Examples of this configuration include the Millrose Games at Madison Square Garden, and the Sunkist Invitational formerly held in the Los Angeles Sports Arena.All four of the common jumping events are held at indoor venues. The long and triple jump areas run alongside the central 60 m track and are mostly identical in form to their outdoor counterparts. The pole vault track and landing area are also alongside the central running track. Shot put and weight throw are the only throwing events held indoors due to size restrictions. The throwing area is similar to the outdoor event, but the landing sector is a rectangular section surrounded by netting or a stop barrier.In addition to hosting the World Indoor Championships, the IAAF has hosted the IAAF World Indoor Tour since 2016.Starts use in raceTrack rules The rules of track events in athletics as observed in most international athletics competitions are set by the Competition Rules of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). The most recent complete set of rules is the 2009 rules that relate only to competitions in 2009. Key rules of track events are those regarding starting, running and finishing. Current World Athletics (WA) Rules are available on WA's website . Current USATF (USA) Competition Rules booklet is available on the USATF website . Prior USATF Competition Rules booklets are also available (2002, 2006 to 2020) .StartingThe start of a race is marked by a white line 5 cm wide. In all races that are not run in lanes the start line must be curved, so that all the athletes start the same distance from the finish. Starting blocks may be used for all races up to and including 400 m (including the first leg of the 4 × 100 m and 4 × 400 m) and may not be used for any other race. No part of the starting block may overlap the start line or extend into another lane.All races must be started by the report of the starter's gun or approved starting apparatus fired upwards after they have ascertained that athletes are steady and in the correct starting position. An athlete may not touch either the start line or the ground in front of it with their hands or feet when on their marks.For sprint races up to 400 m, the starter gives two commands: 'on your marks' to instruct athletes to approach the start line, followed by 'set' to advise the athletes that the start of the race is imminent. The commands of the starter are typically given in the native language in national competitions, or in English or French in international competitions. Once all athletes are set in their starting position, the gun or an approved starting apparatus must be fired or activated. If the starter is not satisfied that all are ready to proceed, the athletes may be called out of the blocks and the process started over.There are different types of starts for races of different distances. Middle- and long-distance races mainly use the waterfall start. This is when all athletes begin on a curved line that moves farther out at the outer edge of the track. Competitors are allowed to move towards the inside lane right away, as long as it is safe to do so. For some middle-distance races, such as 800 m, each athlete starts in their own lane. Once the gun fires, they must run in the lane they began in until markers on the track notify them it is time to move towards the inside lane. For sprint races, athletes begin in start blocks and must stay in their own lane for the entire race.An athlete, after assuming a final set position, may not commence his starting motion until after receiving the report of the gun, or approved starting apparatus. If, in the judgment of the starter or recallers, he does so any earlier, it is considered a false start. It is deemed a false start if, in the judgment of the starter an athlete fails to comply with the commands 'on your marks' or 'set' as appropriate after a reasonable time; or an athlete after the command 'on your marks' disturbs other athletes in the race through sound or otherwise. If the runner is in the 'set' position and moves, then the runner is also disqualified. , any athlete making a false start is disqualified.In International elite competition, electronically tethered starting blocks sense the reaction time of the athletes. If the athlete reacts in less than 0.1 second, an alert sounds for a recall starter and the offending athlete is guilty of a false start. Since 2009, the offending athletes are immediately disqualified.Running the raceFor sprinting events (bar the 4 × 400 m relay and the indoor 400 metres), each athlete must run the race within their allocated lane from start to finish. If an athlete leaves their lane or steps on the line demarking each lane the athlete will be disqualified. Lane rules also apply for initial periods of other track races, for example, the beginning of the 800 m. Similar rules apply for longer distance races when a large field of athletes is present and separate starting points are designated, with the field merging into one group shortly after the starting phase.Any athlete who jostles or obstructs another athlete, in a way that impedes his progress, should be disqualified from that event. However, if an athlete is pushed or forced by another person to run outside his lane, and if no material advantage is gained, the athlete should not be disqualified.The finish The finish of a race is marked by a white line 5 cm wide. The finishing position of athletes is determined by the order in which any part of their torso (as distinguished from the head, neck, arms, legs, hands or feet) reaches the vertical plane of the nearer edge of the finish line. Fully automatic timing systems (photo timing) are becoming more and more common at increasingly lower levels of track meets, improving the accuracy, while eliminating the need for eagle-eyed officials on the finish line. Fully automatic timing (FAT) is required for high level meets and any time a sprint record is set (though distance records can be accepted if timed by three independent stopwatches).With the accuracy of the timing systems, ties are rare. Ties between different athletes are resolved as follows: In determining whether there has been a tie in any round for a qualifying position for the next round based on time, a judge (called the chief photo finish judge) must consider the actual time recorded by the athletes to one thousandth of a second. If the judge decides that there has been a tie, the tying athletes must be placed in the next round or, if that is not practicable, lots must be drawn to determine who must be placed in the next round. In the case of a tie for first place in any final, the referee decides whether it is practicable to arrange for the athletes so tying to compete again. If he decides it is not, the result stands. Ties in other placings remain.Field rules In general, most field events allow a competitor to take their attempt individually, under theoretically the same conditions as the other competitors in the competition. Each attempt is measured to determine who achieved the greatest distance.Vertical JumpsVertical jumps (high jump and pole vault) set a bar at a particular height. The competitor must clear the bar without knocking it off the standards that are holding the bar (flat). Three failures in a row ends the competitor's participation in the event. The competitor has the option to PASS their attempt, which can be used to strategic advantage (of course that advantage is lost if the competitor misses). A pass could be used to save energy and avoid taking a jump that would not improve their position in the standings. After all competitors have either cleared, passed or failed their attempts at a height, the bar goes up. The amount the bar goes up is predetermined before the competition, though when one competitor remains, that competitor may choose their own heights for the remaining attempts. A record is kept of each attempt by each competitor. After all competitors have taken their attempts, the one jumping the highest is the winner, and so on down the other competitors in the event. Ties are broken by first, the number of attempts taken at the highest height (fewest wins), and then if still tied, by the total number of misses in the competition as a whole. The bar does not go back to a lower height except to break a tie for first place or a qualifying position. If those critical positions are still tied after applying the tiebreakers, all tied competitors take a fourth jump at the last height. If they still miss, the bar goes down one increment where they again jump. This process continues until the tie is broken.Horizontal JumpsHorizontal jumps (long jump and triple jump) and all throws must be initiated behind a line. In the case of horizontal jumps, that line is a straight line perpendicular to the runway. In the case of throws, that line is an arc or a circle. Crossing the line while initiating the attempt invalidates the attempt—it becomes a foul. All landings must occur in a sector. For the jumps, that is a sand filled pit, for throws it is a defined sector. A throw landing on the line on the edge of sector is a foul (the inside edge of the line is the outside edge of the sector). Assuming a proper attempt, officials measure the distance from the closest landing point back to the line. The measuring tape is carefully straightened to the shortest distance between the point and the line. To accomplish this, the tape must be perfectly perpendicular to the take off line in jumps, or is pulled through the center point of the arc for throws. The officials at the landing end of the tape have the zero, while the officials at the point of initiation measure and record the length. Whenever a record (or potential record) occurs, that measurement is taken (again) with a steel tape, and observed by at least three officials (plus usually the meet referee). Steel tapes are easily bent and damaged, so are not used to measure everyday competitions. For major competitions, each competitor gets three tries. The top competitors (usually 8 or 9 depending on that competition's rules or the number of lanes on the track) gets three more tries. At that level of competition, the order of competitors for those final three attempts are set—so the competitor in first place at the end of the third round is last, while the last competitor to qualify goes first. Some meets rearrange the competition order again for the final round, so the final attempt is taken by the leader at that point. At other competitions, meet management may choose to limit all competitors to four or three attempts. Whatever the format, all competitors get an equal number of attempts.Equipment Men and women have different weights for their throwing implements – men's javelin is 800 grams compared to 600 for women, men's weight throw is 35 pounds compared to 20 for women, men's discus is 2 kilograms to women's 1, men's shot put is 16 pounds compared to 8 pounds for women, and men's hammer throw is also 16 pounds to the women's 8. Additionally, men's high hurdles are at height of 42 inches compared to women's hurdles which are 33 inches. For the intermediate hurdles (400 meter hurdles), the men's hurdle height is 36 inches compared to 30 inches for women.Organizations The international governance of track and field falls under the jurisdiction of athletics organisations. World Athletics is the global governing body for track and field, and athletics as a whole. The governance of track and field at continental and national level is also done by athletics bodies. Some national federations are named after the sport, including USA TrackField and the Philippine Amateur TrackField Association, but these organisations govern more than just track and field and are in fact athletics governing bodies. These national federations regulate sub-national and local track and field clubs, as well as other types of running clubs.CompetitionsOlympics, Paralympics and world championshipsThe major global track and field competitions are both held under the scope of athletics. Track and field contests make up the majority of events on the Olympic and Paralympic athletics programmes, which occur every four years. Track and field events have held a prominent position at the Summer Olympics since its inception in 1896, and the events are typically held in the main stadium of the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Events such as the 100 metres receive some of the highest levels of media coverage of any Olympic or Paralympic sporting event.The other two major international competition for track and field are organised by the IAAF. The IAAF had selected the Olympic competition as its world championship event in 1913, but a separate world championships for athletics alone was first held in 1983 – the IAAF World Championships in Athletics. The championships comprised track and field competitions plus the marathon and racewalking competitions. Initially, this worked on a quadrennial basis but, after 1991, it changed to a biennial format. In terms of indoor track and field, the IAAF World Indoor Championships has been held every two years since 1985 and this is the only world championships that consists of solely track and field events.Other championshipsSimilar to the event programmes at the Olympics, Paralympics and World Championships, track and field forms a significant part of continental championships. The South American Championships in Athletics, created in 1919, was the first continental championships and the European Athletics Championships became the second championships of this type in 1934. The Asian Athletics Championships and African Championships in Athletics were created in the 1970s and Oceania started its championships in 1990.There are also indoor continental competitions in Europe (European Athletics Indoor Championships) and Asia (Asian Indoor Athletics Championships). There has not been a consistent championships for all of North America, which may be (in part) due to the success of both the Central American and Caribbean Championships and the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships. Most countries have a national championship in track and field and, for athletes, these often play a role in gaining selection into major competitions. Some countries hold many track and field championships at high school and college-level, which help develop younger athletes. Some of these have gained significant exposure and prestige, such as the NCAA Track and Field Championship in the United States and the Jamaican High School Championships. However, the number and status of such competitions significantly vary from country to country.Multi-sport eventsMirroring the role that track and field events have at the Summer Olympics and Paralympics, the sport is featured within the athletics programmes of many major multi-sport events. Among some of the first of these events to follow the Olympic-style model were the World University Games in 1923, the Commonwealth Games in 1930, and the Maccabiah Games in 1932. The number of major multi-sport events greatly increased during the 20th century and thus did the number of track and field events held within them. Typically, track and field events are hosted at the main stadium of the games.After the Olympic and Paralympic Games, the most prominent events for track and field athletes include the three IOC-sanctioned continental games: the All-Africa Games, Asian Games, and the Pan American Games. Other games such as the Commonwealth Games and Summer Universiade, and World Masters Games have significant participation from track and field athletes. Track and field is also present at the national games level, with competitions such as the Chinese National Games serving as the most prestigious national competition for domestic track and field athletes.Meetings main|Track and field meeting As of May 2010, no such article –> One-day track and field meetings form the most common and seasonal aspect of the sport – they are the most basic level of track and field competition. Meetings are generally organised annually either under the patronage of an educational institution or sports club, or by a group or business that serves as the meeting promoter. In the case of the former, athletes are selected to represent their club or institution. In the case of privately run or independent meetings, athletes participate on an invitation-only basis.The most basic type of meetings are all-comers track meets, which are largely small, local, informal competitions that allow people of all ages and abilities to compete. As meetings become more organized they can gain official sanctioning by the local or national association for the sport.At the professional level, meetings began to offer significant financial incentives for all athletes in the 1990s in Europe with the creation of the 'Golden Four' competition, comprising meetings in Zürich, Brussels, Berlin and Oslo. This expanded and received IAAF backing as the IAAF Golden League in 1998, which was later supplemented by the branding of selected meetings worldwide as the IAAF World Athletics Tour. In 2010, the Golden League idea was expanded globally as the Diamond League series and this now forms the top tier of professional one-day track and field meetings.World rankingsThe IAAF World Rankings system was introduced for the 2018 season. An athlete's position within the ranking will be determined by points scored based on their performance and importance of the competition. The points will be considered for eligibility for the World Athletics Championships and Olympic Games. This system will affect athlete participation, which has typically been determined by national bodies, either through selection panels or national trials events.RecordsAthletes performances are timed or measured at virtually all track and field competitions. Doing so can not only serve as a way of determining the winner in an event, but it can also be used for historical comparison (i.e. a record). A large variety of record types exist and men's and women's performances are recorded separately. The foremost types of records organise athlete's performances by the region they represent—beginning with national records, then continental records, up to the global or world record level. National governing bodies control the national record lists, the area associations organise their respective continental lists, and the IAAF ratifies world records.The IAAF ratifies track and field world records if they meet their set criteria. The IAAF first published a world records list in 1914, initially for men's events only. There were 53 recognised records in running, hurdling and relay, and 12 field records. World records in women's events began in 1936 as more events were gradually added to the list, but significant changes were made in the late 1970s. First, all records in imperial measurements were abandoned in 1976, with the sole exceptional being the mile run due to the prestige and history of the event. The following year, all world records in sprint events would only be recognised if fully automatic electronic timing was used (as opposed to the traditional hand-timing stopwatch method). In 1981, electronic timing was made compulsory for all world record runs in track and field, with times being recorded to within one hundredth of a second. Two additional types of world record were introduced in 1987: world records for indoor competitions, and world records for junior athletes under 20 years old.The next most important record type are those achieved at a specific competition. For example, the Olympic records represent the best performances by athletes at the Summer Olympics. All major championships and games have their relevant competition records and a large number of track and field meetings keep a note of their meet records. Other record types include: stadium records, records by age range, records by disability, and records by institution or organisation. Cash bonuses are usually offered to athletes if they break significant records, as doing so can generate greater interest and public attendance in track and field competitions.DopingTrack and field athletes are banned from ingesting or using certain substances by governing bodies for the sport, from the national to the international level. The IAAF's constitution incorporates the World Anti-Doping Code among other anti-doping measures. Practices such as blood doping and the use of anabolic steroids, peptide hormones, stimulants, or diuretics can give athletes a physical competitive advantage in track and field. The use of such substances in track and field is opposed on both ethical and medical grounds. Given that the sport functions by measuring and comparing athletes' performances, performance-enhancing substances create an uneven playing field — athletes who do not use doping substances have a disadvantage over rivals who do. Medically, the use of banned substances may have an adverse effect upon athletes' health. However, some exemptions are made for athletes who take banned substances for therapeutic use, and athletes are not sanctioned for usage in these cases, such as Kim Collins' failed drug test due to asthma medication.Athletes have historically been willing to take legal and health risks to improve their performance, with some even stating their willingness to risk their lives, as exemplified by research by Mirkin, Goldman and Connor in researching attitudes to the so-called Goldman dilemma. To prevent use of performance-enhancing substances, athletes must submit to drug tests that are conducted both in and out of competition by anti-doping officials or accredited medical staff. Penalized athletes are susceptible to higher testing upon return to competition. Athletes found to have taken substances on the World Anti-Doping Agency's banned list receive sanctions and may be banned from competition for a period of time that corresponds to the seriousness of the infraction. However, the use of substances not on the prohibited list may also result in sanctions if the substance is deemed similar to a banned substance in either composition or effect. Athletes may also be sanctioned for missing tests, seeking to avoid testing or tampering with results, refusing to submit to testing, through circumstantial evidence, or confession of use.Doping has played a significant part in the modern history of track and field. State-sponsored doping in East Germany with hormones and anabolic steroids marked the rise of women from East Germany in track and field from the late 1960s to the 1980s. A number of these women, such as Marita Koch, broke world records and were highly successful at international competitions. Some athletes, who were following a doping plan from their teenage years, suffered significant health problems as a result of the regime. A similar state-sponsored doping system was developed in the Soviet Union. In 2016, The New York Times published an article detailing the use of doping by the Soviets in preparation for the 1984 Olympics. Ben Johnson ran a new world record in the 100 metres at the 1988 Seoul Olympics but was later banned for using anabolic steroids. In the mid-first decade of the 21st century, the BALCO Scandal eventually resulted in the downfall of prominent sprinters such as Marion Jones and Tim Montgomery, among others, through their usage of banned substances. The revelation state-sponsored doping in Russia led to an international ban on all its athletes in 2016, with Russians having to apply to the IAAF to compete as Authorised Neutral Athletes at events such as the 2016 Summer Olympics and 2017 World Championships in Athletics. Doping has affected countries on all continents and has occurred in individual, team and national settings.Related sports Track and field bears most similarity to the others categorised under the sport of athletics, specifically cross country running, and road forms of racewalking and running. All these forms of racing tend to record finishing times, have strictly defined start and finish points, and are generally individual in nature. Middle- and long-distance runners usually participate in cross country and road events, in addition to the track. Track racewalkers are most typically road specialists as well. It is unusual for track and field athletes outside of these two groups to compete in cross country or road events.Varieties of strength athletics, such as the World's Strongest Man and highland games, often incorporate forms of footracing, carrying heavy objects, as well as throwing events such as the caber toss and keg toss, which bear similarities to track and field throwing events.See also Cross country running List of track and field stadiums by capacity Racewalking Road runningReferencesExternal linksWorld Athletics official website USA TrackField official website Track and field at About.com Results and statistics for collegiate, high school, middle school, and club teams Masters TF World RankingsIndividual sports Athletics by type Articles containing video clips", "machine_text": "Track and field, also known as athletics, is a discipline of sports that involves various competitive events based on running, jumping, and throwing. It is one of the most popular and oldest sports in the world, with its origins dating back to ancient Greece. The sport has now become an important part of the Olympic Games, where athletes from around the world come together to compete and showcase their athletic skills. Track and field events are divided into two main categories: track events and field events. Track events involve running distances ranging from sprint races that cover 100m to long-distance races of up to 10,000m. There are also hurdles, steeplechase, and relay races. Field events, on the other hand, involve jumping, throwing, and vaulting. These events include high jump, long jump, triple jump, pole vault, shot put, discus, hammer throw, and javelin. The sport requires physical fitness, determination, and discipline. Athletes need to have excellent coordination, balance, and agility to succeed. Training regimes incorporate a variety of drills, techniques, and exercises that enhance speed, strength, flexibility, and endurance. Track and field events have been known to produce some of the greatest athletes of all time. Some of the legendary athletes of the past include Jesse Owens, who won four gold medals in the 1936 Olympics; Paavo Nurmi, a Finnish long-distance runner who won nine gold medals in the Olympics; and Carl Lewis, a sprinter and long jumper who has won nine Olympic gold medals and eight World Championships. Today, track and field continues to captivate fans around the globe. The annual World Championships and Diamond League events provide athletes with an opportunity to compete against the best in the world. The sport has also evolved over the years, with new events such as the hammer throw, steeplechase, and indoor competitions being introduced. In conclusion, track and field remains a popular sport that tests the physical abilities and competitive spirit of athletes. The glory of the sport is rooted in its ancient origins, and the feats of the athletes continue to inspire and delight audiences around the world.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 194904}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Hot game\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "In combinatorial game theory, a branch of mathematics, a hot game is one in which each player can improve their position by making the next move.By contrast, a cold game is one where each player can only worsen their position by making the next move.Cold games have values in the surreal numbers and so can be ordered by value, while hot games can have other values.Example For example, consider a game in which players alternately remove tokens of their own color from a table, the Blue player removing only blue tokens and the Red player removing only red tokens, with the winner being the last player to remove a token.Obviously, victory will go to the player who starts off with more tokens, or to the second player if the number of red and blue tokens are equal.Removing a token of one's own color leaves the position slightly worse for the player who made the move, since that player now has fewer tokens on the table.Thus each token represents a 'cold' component of the game.Now consider a special purple token bearing the number '100', which may be removed by either player, who then replaces the purple token with 100 tokens of their own color.(In the notation of Conway, the purple token is the game 100|−100.)The purple token is a 'hot' component, because it is highly advantageous to be the player who removes the purple token.Indeed, if there are any purple tokens on the table, players will prefer to remove them first, leaving the red or blue tokens for last.In general, a player will always prefer to move in a hot game rather than a cold game, because moving in a hot game improves their position, while moving in a cold game injures their position.Temperature The temperature of a game is a measure of its value to the two players.A purple '100' token has a temperature of 100 because its value to each player is 100 moves.In general, players will prefer to move in the hottest component available.For example, suppose there is a purple '100' token and also a purple '1,000' token which allows the player who takes it to dump 1,000 tokens of their own color on the table.Each player will prefer to remove the '1,000' token, with temperature 1,000 before the '100' token, with temperature 100.To take a slightly more complicated example, consider the game 10|2 + 5|−5.5|−5 is a token which either player may replace with 5 tokens of their own color, and 10|2 is a token which the Blue player may replace with 10 blue tokens or the Red player may replace with 2 blue tokens.The temperature of the 10|2 component is ½(10 − 2) = 4, while the temperature of the 5|−5 component is 5.This suggests that each player should prefer to play in the 5|−5 component.Indeed, the best first move for the Red player is to replace 5|−5 with −5, whereupon the Blue player replaces 10|2 with 10, leaving a total of 5; had the Red player moved in the cooler 10|2 component instead, the final position would have been 2 + 5 = 7, which is worse for Red.Similarly, the best first move for the Blue player is also in the hotter component, from 5|-5 to 5, even though moving in the 10|2 component produces more blue tokens in the short term.SnortIn the game of Snort, Red and Blue players take turns coloring the vertices of a graph, with the constraint that two vertices that are connected by an edge may not be colored differently.As usual, the last player to make a legal move is the winner.Since a player's moves improve their position by effectively reserving the adjacent vertices for them alone, positions in Snort are typically hot.In contrast, in the closely related game Col, where adjacent vertices may not have the same color, positions are usually cold.ApplicationsThe theory of hot games has found some application in the analysis of endgame strategy in Go.See alsoDomineering, another game in which hot positions ariseCooling and heating (combinatorial game theory), operations to make hot games amenable to the same type of analysis as cold gamesReferencesCombinatorial game theory", "machine_text": "Hot Game Hot game refers to a type of competitive activity that is both physically and mentally intense, typically played between teams or individuals. This term can also refer to any game that is currently popular or in demand, with a strong following and fanbase. Physical intensity is commonly seen in sports such as basketball, soccer, or football. Mental intensity, on the other hand, is often seen in games that require strategy and critical thinking, such as chess or poker. Hot games combine both of these elements, creating a challenging and exciting experience for players and spectators alike. One popular hot game is the game of “hot potato,” in which a small object is passed quickly from player to player, with the goal of avoiding being caught holding the object when time runs out. Other examples of hot games include capture-the-flag, dodgeball, and trivia games. In recent years, video games have become a dominant force in the world of hot games, with multiplayer games such as Fortnite, Call of Duty, and League of Legends attracting millions of players and spectators around the world. These games require both physical dexterity and mental strategy, as players must work together to defeat their opponents and achieve their objectives. Hot games can be played in a variety of settings, from backyards and playgrounds to stadiums and arenas. They can also be played competitively, with tournaments and leagues organized around popular games and sports. In conclusion, hot games offer players and spectators alike a thrilling and challenging experience that combines physical and mental intensity.

Mafia from their ninth studio album, Înapoi În Viitor (Back To The Future). The song features a guest appearance from Romanian pop singer Loredana Groza. Produced by group member Tataee and mixed by longtime B.U.G. Mafia collaborator Cristi Dobrică, it was released for digital download through the group's official website on June 29, 2011.Musically, 'Fără Cuvinte' is predominantly a rap song, backed by a dark, minimalist, drum-heavy production with extra piano keys featured in the introduction and the chorus. However, it also incorporates elements of other genres, particularly pop music with the Loredana Groza-sung chorus and arabic music, using various ethnic instruments in its instrumental production. Lyrically, the song is largely about the social situation in modern-day Romania and about how the group's members feel frustrated when dealing with day-to-day hardship and violence.Due to the song's instrumental being leaked onto the Internet several months in advance to its release, it was a significant commercial success on its official release, particularly in the Romania, where it quickly rose to local music charts just days after being released.BackgroundThe official version premiered through B.U.G. Mafia's official website. It was produced by member and founder Vlad 'Tataee' Irimia, who is known for producing and overseeing every group release since their 1995 debut, Mafia. In an interview with Romanian TV station 1Music Channel, Tataee revealed that, after their 1998 collaboration with Loredana Groza, there had been talks about a new track ever since the mid-2000s, but this was the project that he felt she would be most appropriate to work with on. Groza herself told 1Music that she was excited to work with the group again and that she was anxious to hear reactions from their fans. The song features three verses, each from a group member talking about frustration that arises from dealing with selfishness and human nature altogether.Music videoThe video was shot with Alex Ceaușu, the director behind 'Cât poți tu de tare' (The Best You Can Be) and 'În Anii Ce-au Trecut'. The video also premiered on June 29, 2011.The video begins with an introduction of actors Dragoş Bucur and Mirela Oprişor, who portray an average Romanian family, driving along on a country road while their infant child starts crying in the back of the car. As they start talking and try to comfort their child, they lose control of the car, go on the wrong lane and, as they try to avoid a collision with a truck, they roll over and crash the car. The video then cuts to the crash site with the two parents struggling to get out of the vehicle. As they desperately try to escape and call an emergency service, people start approaching the car, apparently to help them, but as they come closer to the car, they start robbing the two of all their possessions. The video alternates with shots of the group's members reciting their verses and the two characters struggling in agony as witnesses take part in a bizarre bystander effect, not only avoiding to help the two, but taking every valuable object they can find in the car in a scene reminiscent of the 2005 Andrew Niccol drama, Lord of War, meant to portray the absurde implications that poverty casts upon society. The finale reveals the ending of a skillfully crafted dream sequence, as Mirela Oprişor's character suddenly wakes up and comes to realize that she was having a nightmare in the car. The couple is listening to B.U.G. Mafia's previous collaboration with Loredana Groza, a 1998 single called 'Lumea e a mea' (The World Is Mine) in the car.According to Tataee, the video was shot in two locations, one a Bucharest IMGB warehouse and the other an abandoned monastery in Chiajna.Track listingDigital singleReferencesExternal linksB.U.G Mafia official download page.2011 singles B.U.G.

She earned her Artium Baccalaureus degree from Bryn Mawr College in 1960. She studied at King's College London for one year and attended Georgetown University Law Center for two years before moving to Chicago. She received a Juris Doctor from Chicago-Kent College of Law in 1966. She was a legal researcher for Richard J.

She said allowing federal agencies to add conditions to grant funds without explicit congressional authority could lead to 'tyranny.' Rovner wrote, 'The Attorney General in this case used the sword of federal funding to conscript state and local authorities to aid in federal civil immigration enforcement. But the power of the purse rests with Congress, which authorized the federal funds at issue and did not impose any immigration enforcement conditions on the receipt of such funds. It falls to us, the judiciary, as the remaining branch of the government, to act as a check on such usurpation of power.'Rovner was joined by William J. Bauer upholding the nationwide injunction against the policy. Daniel Anthony Manion partially dissented, saying he would narrow the injunction to protect only Chicago.On August 27, 2019, Rovner joined David Hamilton in blocking Indiana's parental notification requirement for abortions.

They are best known today for their recording of 'Stormy Weather'. 'Stormy Weather'is today considered one of the most collectible doo-wop singles ever released. According to the Acoustic Music organization, this version of the song 'is one of the rarest of all RB records. Only three 78rpm and no 45rpm copies are known to exist'.After the group broke up, several of the members went on to join other groups, such as The Videos.The recording of 'Stormy Weather' In 1952, after months of performing at local functions, The Five Sharps were spotted by a producer and taken into a studio to record two songs. The group recorded their own 'Sleepy Cowboy' and the standard 'Stormy Weather'. The session took most of the day and they were paid in hot dogs and soda pop.First tenor Bobby Ward remembers that sales of 'Stormy Weather' were so bad that he and the other members had to buy their own copies, even though they had never been paid for the recording in the first place. The song was released on Jubilee #5104.The 78 rpm In late 1961, record collector Billy Pensabene found a 78 rpm copy of the record and brought it to Times Square Records, run by Irving 'Slim' Rose. Slim borrowed the record to play on his 'Sink Or Swim With Swingin' Slim' radio show on WBNX. While in his care, however, the record was broken. Slim admitted in June 1965 that the record 'broke under [his] arm' on the way home from the studio, but at other times he claimed that his pet raccoon, Teddy, had broken the disc by sitting on it.Slim assured his angry customer that he would replace the broken record. He put up a sign in his store offering 25 in credit for a 78 of the song and50 for a 45 rpm single. When weeks went by without any takers on his offer, Slim raised the rewards. Slim then went to the owner of Jubilee Records, Jerry Blaine, to get him to reissue the original. He was told that 'Stormy Weather' was one of a batch of 80 masters which had been destroyed in a fire.Since Jubilee, in 1952, had been releasing singles on both the 78 and 45 formats, collectors assumed that there must be a 45 somewhere (even then, collectors valued 45s much more than 78s). None ever surfaced, however, and only a handful of 78's of 'Stormy Weather' have ever been found.The re-recording In 1964, as the legend of the song grew, Jubilee hired a new group of musicians, under the name of The Five Sharps. They then recorded a new version of 'Stormy Weather'. It was released as Jubilee 5478, a 45 single. This version is not nearly as collectible as the first version.After 'Stormy Weather' Cuffey was diagnosed with leukemia and died in 1960. Bassett joined late-period incarnations of both the Drifters and the Flamingos, and later, formed the 1970s band, Creative Funk. Bobby Ward cut one unsuccessful record titled 'The Key To The City' in New York in the mid 1960s, but was largely inactive musically. The other members, pianist Tommy Duckett and Mickey Owens, left the music industry until 1975, when four of the surviving group members, including Ward, performed at the Academy of Music in New York.ReferencesJubilee Records artists Doo-wop groups Musical groups from Queens, New York", "machine_text": "The Five Sharps were an American RB group that was formed in Philadelphia in the late 1940s. The group consisted of members George Lee, Eugene Church, Jimmy Nabbie, Morris Wade, and Jimmy Dunn. The group is considered one of the pioneers of the doo-wop genre, and their tight harmonies and soulful vocals helped pave the way for many other African American vocal groups that followed. The Five Sharps began their career singing on the street corners of Philadelphia, and they quickly gained a following with their dynamic performances. They were discovered by producer John Dolphin, who signed them to his record label, Recorded In Hollywood. The group recorded several singles for the label, including 'Stormy Weather' and 'Sleepy Little Cowboy'. In 1953, The Five Sharps signed with Jubilee Records and released their biggest hit, 'Stormy Weather'. The song reached No. 2 on the RB charts and became a national hit, earning the group a spot on 'The Ed Sullivan Show'. Their follow-up singles, 'The Glory of Love' and 'I'll Remember April', were also successful. Despite their success, The Five Sharps disbanded in the late 1950s as members pursued other opportunities. Eugene Church went on to have a successful solo career, and Morris Wade became a member of The Marcels, who had a hit with 'Blue Moon' in 1961. Today, The Five Sharps are remembered as one of the most important groups in the history of doo-wop. Their influence can be heard in the music of many artists, including The Temptations, The Four Tops, and Boyz II Men. In 2002, The Five Sharps were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, cementing their place in music history.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 19150333}

They constitute the forward section of that particular backward class – as forward as any other forward class member. They are not eligible for government-sponsored educational and professional benefit programs. The term was introduced by the Sattanathan Commission in 1971, which directed that the 'creamy layer' should be excluded from the reservations (quotas) of civil posts. It was also identified later by Justice Ram Nandan Committee in 1993.The creamy layer (income) criteria were defined as gross annual income of parents from all sources more than 100,000 rupees (₹ or INR defined by Sattanathan committee in 1971) In 1993 when 'creamy layer' ceiling was introduced, it was ₹ 1 lakh. It was subsequently revised to Rs 2.5 lakh per annum in (2004), and revised to₹ 4.5 lakh (2008), Rs 6 lakh (2013) and Rs 8 lakh (2017). In October 2015, the National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC) proposed that a person belonging to Other Backward Class (OBC) with gross annual income of parents up to Rs 15 lakh should be considered as the minimum ceiling for OBC.

The term creamy layer was first introduced in the case of Indra Sawhney v. Union of India (1992), also called the Mandal case, where the Supreme Court ruled that reservations should only be given to the socially and economically deprived sections of the OBC community. The ruling stated that the creamy layer of the community (those who were already economically and socially advanced) should not be entitled to reservations. The creamy layer is determined by the government's annual income criteria, which have been revised periodically. Those who earn more than the specified income limit set by the government are considered part of the creamy layer and are not eligible for reservations. The concept of the creamy layer prevents economically stable individuals from using reservations for their personal gain, while allowing members of the OBC community who are truly disadvantaged to benefit from affirmative action policies. The reservation system in India, including the concept of the creamy layer, is aimed at promoting social equality and inclusivity. The creamy layer concept has also been extended to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, who were historically oppressed communities in India. The Supreme Court has stated that the creamy layer concept is equally applicable to them as well. Overall, the creamy layer concept is an essential part of India's affirmative action policies and plays a significant role in ensuring that reservations for education and employment opportunities are provided to those who are genuinely deprived and in need of social upliftment.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 8345406}

The towers were intended to act as a deterrent against a foreign invasion by Napoleon and his French Armies as well as being used as general lookout posts. In later years, towers were also used as coast guard stations, lookout stations to prevent smuggling and as other general purpose military installations by various British and Irish defence forces.The Killiney bay towers were specifically planned following a 1797 survey by a Major La Chaussée who was employed by the British administration to survey the area and plot out points of weakness and potential locations for military defensive installations.See alsoList of coastal fortifications of County CorkSourcesBolton, J., Carey, T., Goodbody, R.Clabby, G.

These towers were constructed between 1804 and 1812, primarily to defend Ireland against potential invasions by the Napoleonic forces. Today, these martello towers serve as historic landmarks and are a popular tourist attraction for visitors to the Greater Dublin Area. The martello towers in the Greater Dublin Area were built on a circular plan, with walls that were typically two metres thick and between 9 to 12 metres high. The towers featured two stories, with the ground floor used for storage and the upper level for accommodation. The top of the towers was flat and equipped with a small canon that could rotate 360 degrees, allowing defenders to take aim at their targets in all directions. There were originally 28 martello towers erected along the coast of County Dublin, with the majority located in the Greater Dublin Area. Many of these towers served as watchtowers, providing the perfect vantage point for spotting approaching enemy vessels. In addition, they served as a deterrent to would-be invaders, as their presence alone would force attackers to think twice before attempting an assault. Over time, many of the martello towers in the Greater Dublin Area fell into disrepair, with some being demolished and others converted into private homes. However, in recent years, there has been a renewed interest in these historic landmarks, with many being restored and opened to the public as tourist attractions. Today, visitors to the Greater Dublin Area can explore several of these historic towers, including the ones at Sutton, Howth, and Dalkey.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Catstye Cam\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Catstye Cam is a fell in the English Lake District. It is an outlier of Helvellyn in the Eastern Fells.Name The name of the fell is also given as 'Catstycam', a spelling preferred by Alfred Wainwright in his influential Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells. A third variant, 'Catchedicam', is also quoted by him. Other guidebooks such as Collins Landranger and Birkettfollow Wainwright with 'Catstycam', although the maps of the Ordnance Survey always use 'Catstye Cam'.Topography The Helvellyn range runs broadly north to south for about 7 miles, remaining above 2,000 ft (600 m) throughout its length. Helvellyn itself sits near the centre of this ridge and displays the characteristic form of many of these fells, namely smooth grassy slopes to the west and shattered rock to the east. Helvellyn sends out two eastward arêtes, razor-thin ridges between deep mountain corries. The southerly spur is Striding Edge, easily the most famous ridge in the district, and its northern partner is Swirral Edge. From the summit plateau of Helvellyn a rough slope drops to the start of Swirral Edge, and this narrow ridge curves gracefully down and then back up over half a mile, terminating at Catstye Cam.Taking on the classic mountain shape of a pyramid, Catstye Cam draws the eye in any view where the overtopping bulk of Helvellyn is hidden behind. As Wainwright said 'If Catstycam stood alone, remote from its fellows, it would be one of the finest peaks in Lakeland. It has nearly, but not quite, the perfect mountain form with true simplicity in its soaring lines, and a small pointed top, a real summit that falls away on all sides'. Even with the connection to Helvellyn, Catstye Cam still has a prominence of over 200 ft due to the pronounced bow of Swirral Edge. High Spying How on Striding Edge, by comparison, is nothing but a rock turret, an independent peak in almost no-one's estimation.East of the summit the ridge declines quickly to Red Tarn Beck, whilst there is a third ridge to the north west, giving Catstye Cam a triangular plan. To the north, between the two descending ridges, is an area of crag. The other two faces are steep but smooth.South of Catstye Cam, nestling between the encircling arms of Helvellyn's two edges, is Red Tarn. This pool is named for the colour of the surrounding screes rather than its water, and contains brown trout and schelly, a fresh-water herring. The depth of Red Tarn is now about 80 ft, although in the mid-19th century it was dammed with boulders to increase capacity. This was carried out to provide additional water to the Greenside Mine in Glenridding, the water race still visible as it crosses the slope of Birkhouse Moor.A second tarn once existed in Brown Cove to the north at Catstye Cam, but this is now reduced to a couple of small pools widening the stream. Brown Cove Tarn was another creation of the Greenside mine, a stone faced dam being built in about 1860. The dam is still in place but water now leaks through the base, the extended tarn-bed a smooth patch of luxuriant turf. A water leat passing beneath the north face of Catstye Cam to Red Tarn Beck can still be traced although it is now in ruins. Water from Brown Cove and Red Tarn unites at the base of the east ridge to form Glenridding Beck, flowing on through the village to Ullswater.Geology The principal rock type is the dacitic lapilli-tuff of the Helvellyn Formation.Summit The summit of Catstye Cam is small and neat, bearing only a tiny cairn. The view is extensive and even the looming Helvellyn only adds to the drama by showing its eastern face in close detail. Striding Edge is also seen in profile across Red Tarn, lines of pilgrims frequently queueing at the bottlenecks. By contrast Catstye Cam is often almost completely deserted.AscentsCatstye Cam is normally climbed from Glenridding, either by its east or north west ridges. Both are steep, but there are no technical difficulties. A fair path also climbs via Red Tarn to the midpoint of Swirral Edge, from where a brief detour back to the summit can be made. By far the best option is a circular tour via Striding and Swirral Edges. This takes in Birkhouse Moor, Helvellyn and Catstye Cam, one of the most breathtaking walks in the country.ReferencesHewitts of England Fells of the Lake District Nuttalls Patterdale", "machine_text": "Catstye Cam is a fell located in the easternmost part of the range of mountains called the Eastern Fells in the Lake District National Park, in Cumbria, England. At 890 meters (2,920 ft) high, it is the highest point on the ridge between the summits of Helvellyn to the north and Glenridding Dodd to the south. The name 'Catstye Cam' is derived from the Old English word 'castell', which means castle or stronghold. The final element is the Old Norse word 'kambr', which means comb or crest, referring to the shape of the hill. The summit ridge is a long narrow plateau of grass and rock, with a sharp drop down the north face towards Swirral Edge, which leads to Helvellyn. The fell can be climbed by several routes, the most popular being from Glenridding, Patterdale, and Thirlmere. The most direct route is from Glenridding, which involves a steep climb up the rocky ridge of Striding Edge, a popular activity among walkers and climbers. The path from Patterdale is slightly longer but is a less strenuous ascent. The path from Thirlmere requires a longer walk but is a gentler climb. Catstye Cam is a popular location for hill walking, rock climbing, and scrambling. The rock on the summit is a hard, volcanic rock called andesite which provides excellent grip for climbers. There is good birdwatching on Catstye Cam, with sightings including red grouse, curlew, and skylark.

He was aged 79 at the time of recording. A song from the album entitled 'Outlaw' was included in the score of Gus Van Sant's 2007 film, Paranoid Park. 'Saw Mill Man' drew comparisons to Johnny Cash's American Recordings series. King's baritone voice and acoustic guitar have been praised as possessing a raw and affecting quality. The narratives of the songs dealt with characteristic country themes such as poverty, broken relationships, and murderous outlaws. Although his opportunity to record a full-length album came late in life, Cast King had previously recorded for Sun Records in 1955. With his band, The Country Drifters, he cut around a dozen songs at this time. It was musician, Matt Downer, who located King and encouraged him to come out of a long musical retirement and record. Downer also played electric guitar throughout 'Saw Mill Man'. The record was met with favourable reviews from Rolling Stone, Arthur Magazine, Mojo, and No Depression among other publications.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Pearl gourami\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The pearl gourami (Trichopodus leerii) is a species of gourami native to Southeast Asia.Description These fish reach aboutTL. The body is a brownish-silver colour, covered in a pearl-like pattern with a distinct black line running from the fish's head, and gradually thinning towards the caudal fin. This fish's appearance has given rise to many popular names, such as the lace gourami and the mosaic gourami.Male specimens of this fish, typical of many gouramis, are generally larger and more colourful than their female counterparts. They exhibit bright orange colouring around the throat region, which at breeding time becomes much brighter and is used to court the female. Males also exhibit somewhat of an orange tinge in their fins, with the exception of the caudal (tail) fin. The male also has longer fins, with a more pointed dorsal fin and extended anal fin rays.Distribution and habitat The pearl gourami is native to Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia (where it is found on the islands of Sumatra, and Borneo). It occurs in lowland swamps with acidic water. This fish prefers the top and middle levels of the water.Species description and name Trichopodus leerii was formally described as Trichopus leerii by the Dutch medical doctor and ichthyologist Pieter Bleeker in 1852. The type was collected at Palembang in Sumatra by Lieutenant-Colonel J. M. van Leer who was a medical colleague of Bleeker's and whom Bleeker honoured in its specific name.In the aquariumTank requirements A tank with a volume of 120 litres (30 gallons) or over is generally recommended for a pair of pearl gouramis, although anything above that volume is greatly recommended, since these fish may show signs of stress, abnormal aggression, and illness when confined. Preferred tank temperatures are 22–28°C (72–82F). Tanks with surfaces exposed to fresh, humid air are needed so that the pearl gourami's labyrinth organ can function correctly. As with any tropical aquarium, adequate filtration, lighting, substrate and decorations, plants, and other parts of proper care are required. This fish may be somewhat timid or shy, and should not be kept with fish that are too boisterous or aggressive. In fact, in the first several days or weeks, these fish typically show extreme shyness and timidness, spending a great deal of time hiding, regardless of tank-mates or water properties. If in proper conditions, however, they will outgrow this and become more gregarious, becoming social fish. Although somewhat hardy, pearl gouramis can be vulnerable to disease, so clean water is a must. Many gouramis display bolder behavior when the tank is furnished with plants, decorations, and ornaments which provide safe refuges for the fish in times of stress.Breeding The pearl gourami is a bubble nest builder that uses plants to help bind together the bubbles. The water level should be reduced to 20 cm (8 in) during spawning, and the temperature should be approximately 28 °C (82 °F) and with a pH of around 7. After spawning both adults cannot be kept together. The eggs hatch after two days and the fry become free swimming three days later (Ter Morshuizen 2007). When they commence with swimming freely the fry can be fed infusoria and brine shrimp, and a week later finely ground flakes. Freeze-dried tablets may also be fed to older fry. The temperature needs to be high (about 84 °F) and with little or no water movement. Since they are air breathers, filtration is not necessary.The pearl gourami has a very unusual and beautiful mating dance. The male builds a nest of tiny, durable bubbles. The female takes a position under the nest and the male curves his body tightly around her, from underneath. Her body quivers while she expels a few eggs. Next he releases her and picks up the eggs in his mouth as they are sinking, then he spits them into the bubble nest. This sequence is repeated several times, until the female has laid all of her eggs.The fry are tiny at hatching (.2 mm or smaller). The male cares for the fry, taking them into his mouth and spitting them back into the nest if they fall out. Some tend to grow faster than others, and will exhibit fratricide, eating their smaller siblings.ReferencesPearl gourami Fish of Southeast Asia Fish of Thailand Fish described in 1852 Taxa named by Pieter Bleeker", "machine_text": "Pearl Gourami (Trichopodus leerii) is a freshwater fish species native to Southeast Asia, particularly in the countries of Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Indonesia. It belongs to the family Osphronemidae, which is also known as the gourami family. The pearl gourami is a popular aquarium fish, known for its graceful beauty and calm demeanor. Appearance This species of gourami is named for the pearly iridescence of its scales. They have a distinctive pearlescent pattern on their bodies, with a pinkish-white color on their ventral fins, and the males have a longer dorsal fin compared to females. Males also have a dark spot on their dorsal fin. They can grow up to 4 inches in length. Habitat and Behavior In the wild, pearl gouramis inhabit slow-moving streams, ponds, and rivers. They prefer planted areas of the waterways, especially with thick vegetation as it provides shelter and breeding grounds. They are a peaceful species that live well with other peaceful fish in an aquarium and are known for their friendliness towards other fish. Diet In the wild, pearl gouramis are omnivorous, and their diet consists of insects, larvae, crustaceans, and algae. When kept as aquarium fish, they can be fed a balanced diet of flake and pellet foods. They also enjoy live or frozen foods like brine shrimp and bloodworms. Breeding Pearl gouramis reach sexual maturity at around 6-8 months, with males becoming more colorful in their nuptial dress. They are bubble nest builders, meaning that they make bubble nests on the surface of water from bubbles produced in their mouths. Females lay their eggs in these nests, and the males then fertilize them. After around 24-36 hours, the eggs hatch with the fry becoming free-swimming after a further 2-3 days. Conservation Status The pearl gourami is not currently listed as endangered by the IUCN Red List, although their habitats and populations in the wild are threatened by habitat loss and degradation, poaching, and pollution. They are bred extensively in captivity to meet the demand for the aquarium trade, reducing the pressure on wild populations. In Conclusion The Pearl Gourami is a peaceful freshwater fish species popular in the aquarium trade due to its beauty, friendliness, and relatively low maintenance. They are easy to take care of, but they require plants and hiding spaces in their aquarium to ensure that they feel safe and secure. Their omnivorous diet is easy to manage, and they can be bred in captivity with ease. With proper care and attention, Pearl Gouramis could provide aquarium owners with years of enjoyment.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 4209862}

The population was 270 at the 2010 census.GeographyMoran is located at(32.545945, -99.166275). The town is situated at the intersection of Texas State Highway 6 and Farm to Market 576 approximately 15 miles southeast of Albany, 18 miles northwest of Cisco, 29 miles southwest of Breckenridge, and 42 miles east-northeast of Abilene. Nearby creeks include Deep Creek, Post Oak Creek, Battle Creek, and Hubbard Creek.According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 0.4 square mile (1.1 km2), all land.HistoryPioneers came to this area as early as the 1860s. During the Civil War (1861–65), they built the temporary fortress settlement of Mugginsville on Deep Creek 5 miles north of the future town site of Moran. At one time, a branch of the Western Cattle Trail passed nearby. Population increased after the arrival of the Texas Central Railroad in 1881. Hulltown, the original name of the town, was established by Mary and George Washington 'Swope' Hull of McDowell, Virginia, who opened a general store at the rail crossing on Deep Creek in 1883. Hull (1849-1911) was the first postmaster. He bought 160 acres between Post Oak and Deep Creeks and platted a town site in March 1884 (he and his family would later move to Oakland, California). Most of the property was bought by Bem Scott, a real estate developer from Indiana, who eventually sold his interests in 1890 to Matthew D. Bray (1845-1926), a prominent local merchant and landowner. For unknown reasons, the town's name was changed to Hicks in 1890. Later, in order to secure a new railroad depot, the town was renamed a third and final time to Moran in 1892 for Texas Central Railroad owner Charles Moran of New York.By 1900, the community had several businesses, a school and Baptist, Church of Christ, Cumberland Presbyterian, and Methodist congregations. A newspaper was begun in 1895 and bank in 1902. In November 1910, the Cottle No. 1 natural gas well discovery opened the nearby Moran Field, and was the first commercial gas well completed in this vast west Texas area. In the spring of 1911, gas was piped to Moran for residential and business use. Within two years (in 1913) the cities of Albany, Cisco, and Abilene were supplied for the first time with natural gas. By Oct. 1913, with five producing gas wells, the Moran Field won recognition as one of the most important sources of fossil fuels in Texas. For the next fifteen years, oil and gas discoveries in the area made Moran a boom town with a peak population of 5,000 - 10,000 at one point in the 1920s. By the 1930s, the boom was over and the population gradually began its decline to the present day. Note: much of the information above comes from the local historical markers to the town and to the Cottle No. 1 gas well.In the late 1980s, Moran achieved fame as the home of the National Fajita Cook-off, which brought thousands of visitors from all over the world to the sleepy town. In the 2000s, Moran became home to Slide Fire Solutions, a multi-million dollar bump stock production company. The local economy remains tied to farming, ranching, and oil and gas production.Local Texas historical markers are devoted to: Moran (#3468), Cottle No. 1 Natural Gas Well (#1076), Granville E. Waters (#13204), Moran Cemetery (#17708), and Moran Church of Christ (#17SF02).DemographicsAs of the census of 2000, there were 233 people, 97 households, and 67 families residing in the city. The population density was 539.0 people per square mile (209.2/km2). There were 146 housing units at an average density of 337.7/sq mi (131.1/km2).

Moran, and quickly became a hub for agricultural activity. The town's economy was primarily focused on agriculture, including cotton, wheat, and cattle, until the mid-20th century when oil was discovered in the surrounding area. Today, oil and gas production remain important to the local economy. Moran has a rich history and is home to several historic buildings and landmarks. The town's most notable landmark is the Moran Methodist Church, which dates back to the early 1900s. Other historic buildings include the Moran High School building, which was constructed in 1937, and the Moran Christian Church, which was built in 1894. The town is also known for its annual Moran Frontier Days, a celebration of the town's history and culture that includes a parade, live music, and a rodeo.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"List of current monarchs of sovereign states\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "A monarch is the head of a monarchy, a form of government in which a state is ruled by an individual who normally rules for life or until abdication, and typically inherits the throne by birth. Monarchs may be autocrats (as in all absolute monarchies) or may be ceremonial figureheads, exercising only limited or no reserve powers at all, with actual authority vested in a legislature and/or executive cabinet (as in many constitutional monarchies). In many cases, a monarch will also be linked with a state religion. Most states only have a single monarch at any given time, although a regent may rule when the monarch is a minor, not present, or otherwise incapable of ruling. Cases in which two monarchs rule simultaneously over a single state, as is the current situation in Andorra, are known as coregencies.A variety of titles are applied in English; for example, 'king' and 'queen', 'prince' and 'princess', 'emperor' and 'empress'. Although they will be addressed differently in their local languages, the names and titles in the list below have been styled using the common English equivalent. Roman numerals, used to distinguish related rulers with the same name, have been applied where typical.In political and sociocultural studies, monarchies are normally associated with hereditary rule; most monarchs, in both historical and contemporary contexts, have been born and raised within a royal family. Succession has been defined using a variety of distinct formulae, such as proximity of blood, primogeniture, and agnatic seniority. Some monarchies, however, are not hereditary, and the ruler is instead determined through an elective process; a modern example is the throne of Malaysia. These systems defy the model concept of a monarchy, but are commonly considered as such because they retain certain associative characteristics. Many systems use a combination of hereditary and elective elements, where the election or nomination of a successor is restricted to members of a royal bloodline.Entries below are listed beside their respective dominions, which are organised alphabetically.

The movie is based on a real hoax that took place in 1995, where two Englishmen, Ray Santilli and Gary Shoefield, claimed to have obtained and released footage of an alien autopsy performed by the US military after a supposed crash in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947. The film stars Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, also known as Ant and Dec, as Ray Santilli and Gary Shoefield, respectively. Other cast members include Bill Pullman, Harry Dean Stanton, and Götz Otto. The film was shot on location in London, Prague, and Sheffield. Alien Autopsy was released on April 7, 2006, and received mixed reviews from critics. The film grossed 8.7 million at the box office. Despite not being a commercial success, Alien Autopsy has since gained a cult following, especially in the UK. The film's plot revolves around Ray and Gary, two struggling British filmmakers who stumble across footage of an alien autopsy while trying to sell old reels of film. They decide to release the footage as a documentary, claiming it to be authentic, in the hopes of making a fortune. As they gain fame and fortune, they continue to perpetuate the hoax despite mounting evidence to the contrary. The film is presented as a mockumentary, blending real interviews with fictional reenactments of events. Alien Autopsy is a satirical look at the media's obsession with conspiracy theories and the lengths people will go to make a quick buck. The film's humor is often irreverent, poking fun at both the hoaxers and the believers. Despite its flaws, Alien Autopsy is an entertaining and enjoyable comedy that offers a fresh perspective on one of the most enduring mysteries of the modern era.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 4109723}

It was written by the band's lead vocalist and songwriter, David Byrne. Heaven is known for its infectious guitar riff and Byrne's introspective lyrics. The song explores themes of mortality, spirituality and the afterlife, with Byrne questioning whether heaven truly exists or whether it's simply a figment of human imagination. The song's opening lines, 'Everyone is trying to get to the bar / The name of the bar, the bar is called heaven / The band in heaven plays my favorite song / They play it once again, they play it all night long,' have become iconic among fans of Talking Heads. Heaven was initially met with mixed reviews upon its release, with some critics finding it too straightforward compared to the band's earlier experimental sound. However, over time, the song has become one of the band's most beloved and enduring tracks, frequently appearing on lists of the greatest songs of all time. In addition to its appearance on Fear of Music, Heaven has also been included on several of Talking Heads' greatest hits compilations, including the aptly titled Popular Favorites: Sand in the Vaseline. The song has been covered by numerous artists, including the band Weezer, who recorded a version for the soundtrack to the 2017 film Cars 3.

He has been credited with originating the term hip hop and some of the themes in his music were precursors of gangsta rap.CareerJackson was born in Harlem, New York City, receiving his 'Spoonie' nickname as a child because the spoon was the only utensil that he used to eat with. His mother died when he was twelve years old, and he went to live with his uncle, the record producer Bobby Robinson, in whose apartment he began to practice rapping.His first recording came about after Peter Brown visited Robinson's record store and mentioned that he was looking to make a rap record. Spoonie's name was suggested, and he recorded 'Spoonin' Rap', which was released on Brown's Sound of New York, USA imprint, featuring a lyric that included jailhouse references that would later become common in gangsta rap, and with echo applied to his vocals. Spoonie Gee has been described as 'the original gangsta rapper'.He then recorded for Robinson's Enjoy! Records; his first release for the label being the similarly minimalistic 'Love Rap' (on which he was accompanied on congas by his brother Pooche Costello), issued on the B-side of the Treacherous Three's 'New Rap Language' (on which he also featured), leading to his early nickname of 'The Love Rapper'. Jackson was a founding member of the Treacherous Three, along with L.A. Sunshine and Kool Moe Dee. Although the group added Special K as a member when Jackson left to record his first single, Gee maintained ties and affiliation with the group, and also played a hand in the group getting their first record deal.

Born Gabriel Jackson, he is best known for his hit song 'Spoonin' Rap' (1980) and is credited as one of the first rappers to introduce storytelling and social commentary into hip hop music. Jackson grew up in the Bronx during the early days of hip hop and was heavily influenced by the sounds of DJs like Kool Herc and Grandmaster Flash. He began rapping in local clubs and eventually caught the attention of Sylvia Robinson, the founder of Sugar Hill Records. In 1979, Jackson signed onto Sugar Hill Records and released his debut single 'Spoonin' Rap' the following year. The song, which tells the story of a man named Spoonie who goes out to pick up women, became an instant hit and helped pave the way for future rap acts. In 1982, Jackson released his debut album 'The Godfather of Rap' and continued to gain popularity with tracks like 'Love Rap' and 'The Big Beat'. However, despite his early success, Spoonie Gee struggled to maintain a consistent career and eventually faded from the limelight. Despite this, his influence on hip hop music cannot be ignored. His use of storytelling and social commentary helped to establish a new era of rap music, paving the way for future acts like N.W.A, Nas, and Jay Z. Today, Spoonie Gee's legacy lives on as one of the founding fathers of hip hop. He continues to be revered by rap fans and fellow musicians alike, with many citing his work as a major influence on their own music. Jackson's contributions to the music industry have been recognized through his induction into the Bronx Walk of Fame and the Hip Hop Hall of Fame.

It was released in 1993 by Virgin Records. The album marked a departure from the band's earlier sound, incorporating more electronic and experimental elements. The album was produced by Neil McLellan, who had previously worked with the band on their 1987 release, The Price You Pay. McLellan's production on Outland incorporated a wide range of textures and sounds, including samples, loops, and electronic effects. The album's lead single, 'Sputnik', is a prime example of this new direction. The song features a driving beat, distorted guitars, and a prominent electronic melody. The accompanying music video, directed by Tim Pope, features the band performing on a futuristic set, adorned with glowing neon lights and space-age props. Other standout tracks on the album include 'Last Card', 'Grapes of Wrath', and 'Radio Radio'. These songs showcase the band's ability to blend traditional rock instrumentation with more modern sounds and production techniques. Despite receiving positive reviews from critics, Outland was not a commercial success. The album failed to chart in the United States or the United Kingdom, and it would be the band's last release for Virgin Records. In retrospect, Outland is often cited as an overlooked gem in the Spear of Destiny discography. The album's innovative production and experimental approach to songwriting helped set the band apart from their peers, and its influence can be heard in the work of later artists such as Nine Inch Nails and The Prodigy.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 8701195}

Despite their brutality, Armies of Death have often been successful in achieving their military objectives. The Mongol Empire, for instance, was able to conquer vast territories due to their ruthless tactics, while the Nazi SS was able to maintain order within occupied territories through fear and intimidation. In modern times, the use of Armies of Death has been widely condemned by the international community and is considered a violation of human rights. Nevertheless, these groups continue to exist and pose a significant threat to global security.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 6867420}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"William Cullen Bryant\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "William Cullen Bryant (November 3, 1794 – June 12, 1878) was an American romantic poet, journalist, and long-time editor of the New York Evening Post. Born in Massachusetts, he started his career as a lawyer but showed an interest in poetry early in his life. He soon relocated to New York and took up work as an editor at various newspapers. He became one of the most significant poets in early literary America and has been grouped among the fireside poets for his accessible, popular poetry.BiographyYouth and education Bryant was born on November 3, 1794, in a log cabin near Cummington, Massachusetts; the home of his birth is today marked with a plaque. He was the second son of Peter Bryant (b. Aug. 12, 1767, d. Mar. 20, 1820), a doctor and later a state legislator, and Sarah Snell (b. Dec. 4, 1768, d. May 6, 1847). The genealogy of his mother traces back to passengers on the Mayflower: John Alden (b. 1599, d. 1687), his wife Priscilla Mullins and her parents William and Alice Mullins. The story of the romance between John and Priscilla is the subject of a famous narrative poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow The Courtship of Miles Standish.He was also the nephew of Charity Bryant, a Vermont seamstress who is the subject of Rachel Hope Cleves's 2014 book Charity and Sylvia: A Same-Sex Marriage in Early America. William Cullen Bryant described their relationship: 'If I were permitted to draw the veil of private life, I would briefly give you the singular, and to me interesting, story of two maiden ladies who dwell in this valley. I would tell you how, in their youthful days, they took each other as companions for life, and how this union, no less sacred to them than the tie of marriage, has subsisted, in uninterrupted harmony, for more than forty years.' Charity and Sylvia Drake are buried together at Weybridge Hill Cemetery, Weybridge, Vermont.Bryant and his family moved to a new home when he was two years old. The William Cullen Bryant Homestead, his boyhood home, is now a museum. After just one year at Williams College (he entered with sophomore standing), he hoped to transfer to Yale, but a talk with his father led to the realization that family finances would not support it. His father counseled a legal career as his best available choice, and the disappointed poet began to study law in Worthington and Bridgewater in Massachusetts. He was admitted to the bar in 1815 and began practicing law in nearby Plainfield, walking the seven miles from Cummington every day. On one of these walks, in December 1815, he noticed a single bird flying on the horizon; the sight moved him enough to write 'To a Waterfowl'.Bryant developed an interest in poetry early in life. Under his father's tutelage, he emulated Alexander Pope and other Neo-Classic British poets. 'The Embargo', a savage attack on President Thomas Jefferson published in 1808, reflected Dr. Bryant's Federalist political views. The first edition quickly sold out—partly because of publicity attached to the poet's young age. A second, expanded edition included Bryant's translation of classical verse. During his collegiate studies and his reading for the law, he wrote little poetry, but encounters with the Graveyard Poets and then Wordsworth regenerated his passion for 'the witchery of song.'Early poetry'Thanatopsis' is Bryant's most famous poem, which Bryant may have been working on as early as 1811.In 1817 his father took some pages of verse from his son's desk, and at the invitation of Willard Phillips, an editor of the North American Review who had previously been tutored in the classics by Dr. Bryant, he submitted them along with his own work. The editor of the Review, Edward Tyrrel Channing, read the poem to associate editor Richard Henry Dana Sr., who immediately exclaimed, 'That was never written on this side of the water!' Someone at the North American joined two of the son's discrete fragments, gave the result the Greek-derived title Thanatopsis ('meditation on death'), mistakenly attributed it to the father, and published it. After clarification of the authorship, the son's poems began appearing with some regularity in the Review. A portion of Bryant’s poem, Thanatopsis, is at the base of the William Cullen Bryant Memorial behind the New York Public Library which was dedicated in 1911. 'To a Waterfowl', published in 1821, was the most popular.On January 11, 1821, Bryant, still striving to build a legal career, married Frances Fairchild. Soon after, having received an invitation to address the Harvard University Phi Beta Kappa Society at the school's August commencement, Bryant spent months working on 'The Ages', a panorama in verse of the history of civilization, culminating in the establishment of the United States. As it would in all collections he subsequently issued, 'The Ages' led the volume, also entitled Poems, which he arranged to publish on the same trip to Cambridge. For that book, he added sets of lines at the beginning and end of 'Thanatopsis' that changed the poem. His career as a poet was now established, though recognition as America's leading poet waited until 1832, when an expanded Poems was published in the U.S. and, with the assistance of Washington Irving, in Britain.Editorial work From 1816 to 1825, Bryant depended on his law practice in Great Barrington, Massachusetts to sustain his family financially, but the strain of dealing with unsophisticated neighbors pushed him to trade his unrewarding profession for New York City and the promise of a literary career. With the encouragement of a distinguished and well-connected literary family, the Sedgwicks, he quickly gained a foothold in New York City's vibrant cultural life. His first employment, in 1825, was as editor of the New-York Review, which within the next year merged with the United States Review and Literary Gazette. Although literary historians have neglected his fiction, Bryant's stories over the seven-year period from his time with the Review to the publication of Tales of Glauber Spa in 1832 show a variety of strategies, making him the most inventive of practitioners of the genre during this early stage of its evolution.In the throes of the failing struggle to raise subscriptions, he accepted part-time duties with the New-York Evening Post under William Coleman; then, partly because of Coleman's ill health, traceable to the consequences of a duel and then a stroke, Bryant's responsibilities expanded rapidly. From assistant editor he rose to editor-in-chief and co-owner of the newspaper that had been founded by Alexander Hamilton. Over the next half century, the Post would become the most respected paper in the city and, from the election of Andrew Jackson, the major platform in the Northeast for the Democratic Party and subsequently of the Free Soil and Republican Parties. In the process, the Evening-Post also became the pillar of a substantial fortune. Despite his Federalist beginnings, Bryant had shifted to being one of the most liberal voices of the century. An early supporter of organized labor, with his 1836 editorials asserting the right of workmen to strike, Bryant also defended religious minorities and immigrants, and promoted the abolition of slavery. He 'threw himself into the foreground of the battle for human rights' and did not cease speaking out against the corrupting influence of certain bankers in spite of their efforts to break down the paper. According to newspaper historian Frank Luther Mott, Bryant was 'a great liberal seldom done justice by modern writers'.He was elected an Associate Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1855.Despite his once staunch opposition to Thomas Jefferson and his party, Bryant became one of the key supporters in the Northeast of that same party under Jackson. Bryant's views, always progressive though not quite populist, in course led him to join the Free Soilers, and when the Free Soil Party became a core of the new Republican Party in 1856, Bryant vigorously campaigned for John Frémont. That exertion enhanced his standing in party councils, and in 1860, he was one of the prime Eastern exponents of Abraham Lincoln, whom he introduced at Cooper Union. (That 'Cooper Union speech' lifted Lincoln to the nomination, and then the presidency.) In the 1860 presidential election, he elected Lincoln and Hannibal Hamlin as a presidential elector.Later years Bryant edited the very successfulPicturesque America, which was published between 1872 and 1874. This two-volume set was lavishly illustrated and described scenic places in the United States and Canada. In his last decade, Bryant shifted from writing his own poetry to a blank verse translation of Homer's works. He assiduously worked on the Iliad and The Odyssey from 1871 to 1874. He is also remembered as one of the principal authorities on homeopathy and as a hymnist for the Unitarian Church, both legacies of his father's influence on him.In 1843, Bryant bought a house he christened Cedarmere (for the cedar trees around the pond, or 'mere') in Roslyn Harbor, on Long Island.In 1865, he bought the farmhouse in Cummington, where he'd grown up, and summered there annually until his death.He made substantial improvements to the houses at both properties. He was known for his attention to trees on his land, and later in life he expressed concerns that deforestation in the United States would prove disastrous for American agriculture.Bryant died in 1878 of complications from an accidental fall suffered after participating in a Central Park ceremony to honor Italian patriot Giuseppe Mazzini. He is buried at Roslyn Cemetery in Roslyn, New York.Critical responseBryant became one of the most significant poets in early American literary history. He is typically included among the group of poets referred to as the fireside poets, along with Longfellow, John Greenleaf Whittier, James Russell Lowell, and Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. They are considered to be among the first American poets whose popularity rivaled that of British poets, both at home and abroad and are so named because their writing was a source of entertainment for families gathered around the fire at home. Bryant's poetry has been described as being 'of a thoughtful, meditative character, and makes but slight appeal to the mass of readers.'Edgar Allan Poe praised Bryant and specifically the poem 'June' in his essay 'The Poetic Principle': The rhythmical flow, here, is even voluptuous—nothing could be more melodious. The poem has always affected me in a remarkable manner. The intense melancholy which seems to well up, perforce, to the surface of all the poet's cheerful sayings about his grave, we find thrilling us to the soul—while there is the truest poetic elevation in the thrill. The impression left is one of a pleasurable sadness.Editor and children's writer Mary Mapes Dodge wrote that Bryant's poems 'have wrought vast and far-reaching good in the world.' She predicted, 'You will admire more and more, as you grow older, the noble poems of this great and good man.' Poet and literary critic Thomas Holley Chivers said that the 'only thing [Bryant] ever wrote that may be called Poetry is 'Thanatopsis', which he stole line for line from the Spanish. The fact is, that he never did anything but steal—as nothing he ever wrote is original.'Bryant's poetry is tender and graceful, pervaded by a contemplative melancholy, and a love of solitude and the silence of the woods. Though he was brought up to admire Pope, and in his early youth imitated him, he was one of the first American poets to throw off his influence. Bryant had an interest in science and in geology especially. Thomas Cole was a friend and both, at different times, considered the 'geological structure' of Volterra in Italy.He met Charles Lyell in England in 1845.As a writer, Bryant was an early advocate of American literary nationalism, and his own poetry focusing on nature as a metaphor for truth established a central pattern in the American literary tradition.Some however, argue that a reassessment is long overdue. It finds great merit in a couple of short stories Bryant wrote while trying to build interest in periodicals he edited. More importantly, it perceives a poet of great technical sophistication who was a progenitor of Walt Whitman, to whom he was a mentor.LegacyAlthough born in and with deep family ties in New England, Bryant for most of his lifetime was thoroughly a New Yorker—and a very dedicated one at that. He was a major force behind the idea that became Central Park, as well as a leading proponent of creating the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He was one of a group of founders of New York Medical College. He had close affinities with the Hudson River School of art and was an intimate friend of Thomas Cole. A statue of William Cullen Bryant was one of the statues of “Eminent Americans” that surrounded the Palace of Fine Arts at the 1915 Panama Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco, California. The William Cullen Bryant Memorial, in Bryant Park, includes a bronze of the same work by sculptor Herbert Adams. Bryant Park, behind the New York Public Library, in New York bears his name. In 1884, New York City's Reservoir Square, at the intersection of 42nd Street and Sixth Avenue, was renamed Bryant Park, and later Herbert Adam's statue was placed, in Bryant's honor.Just outside New York City, the Long Island village of Roslyn Harbor, New York is home to the William Cullen Bryant Preserve, located on land he formerly owned next to what is now the Nassau County Museum of Art. Bryant is also the namesake of the Bryant Library in Roslyn, New York, located near his Cedarmere Estate.Other locations named after Bryant include: Bryant, a neighborhood in Seattle; Bryant Woods, one of the four original villages in Columbia, Maryland; Cullen Bryant Park in Toronto, Ontario; the Bryant Free Library in Cummington, Massachusetts; and the Bryant House at Williams College.Several schools are named after Bryant, including William Cullen Bryant High School in Long Island City, New York, and elementary schools in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Long Beach, California, Cleveland, Ohio, and Great Barrington, Massachusetts. A rural schoolhouse in Sanford, Maine was also named for Bryant.Martin Luther King Jr. quoted Bryant in his speech 'Give Us the Ballot', when he said, 'there is something in this universe which justifies William Cullen Bryant in saying: 'Truth crushed to earth will rise again.See also Cullen, Saskatchewan and Bryant, SaskatchewanNotesReferencesWilliam Cullen Bryant: An American Voice by Frank Gado ()William Cullen Bryant by Charles H.

The Tremembé people live in tipis.The Tremembé were one of the few Tapuia ('non-Tupi people') that lived on the Brazilian coast on the advent of European contact c. 1500.The Tremembé ranged over a large coastal area ranging across the modern states of Pará, Maranhão, Piauí and Ceará.The ethno-historical map of Nimuendajú situates the traditional territory of the Tremembé in two segments along the northern Atlantic coast of Brazil.The first segment stretched some 160 km from the bay of the Caeté river (by modern Bragança, Pará) to the bay of Turiaçu (Maranhão).The second and principal segment stretched some 500 km, from the environs of São Luís, Maranhão as far as the region of Fortaleza, (Ceará).The small interruption between the two stretches was occupied by a Tupinambá tribe.The Tremembé population are estimated to have once numbered 20,000.The Tremembé, a Tapuia tribe, were virtually surrounded by Tupi peoples - on the coast, there were Tupinambá to the west, and the Potiguara and Tabajara to the east.In their hinterlands were other Tupi ethnicities, like the Guajá, the Urubú and the Guajajara.In the 17th century, the Tremembé began to settle in the Jesuit mission of Aracati-mirím, at Aldeia do Cajueiro (now Almofala) by the Acaraú River in Ceará.There was also a (non-Jesuit) mission at Tutóia (in Maranhão).When the Portuguese minister, the Marquis of Pombal, issued his 1759 decrees expelling the Jesuits and dismantling their missions, the settled Tremembé population moved, along with a handful of priests, to Vila Nova do Soure (Caucaia).However, they did not adapt well to their new environment, and were allowed to return to their old mission settlement, the Aldeia do Cajueiro, which was renamed Almofala and incorporated as an Indian town in 1766.The Tremembé were dispossessed of most their remaining lands in the aftermath of the 1854 'Lei da Terra' (land tenure decree) of the Empire of Brazil.The state governor of Ceará issued a decree in 1863 declaring the Tremembé an extinct people, remaining Indians officially regarded as caboclos (mixed-race) or 'descendents' of Indians, but not an existing ethnicity.Nonetheless, the Tremembé resurged and received recognition from the Fundação Nacional do Índio in the 1980s.LanguageThe original language of the Tremembé is extinct. Current members of the ethnicity speak Portuguese as their mother tongue.The language is unclassified, but generally believed to have not been part of the Tupi–Guarani family (thus, 'Tapuia', or non-Tupi). Nonetheless, the Tremembé may have borrowed a considerable number of Tupi words through interaction with their Tupi neighbors.NotesExternal linksTremembé at Povo Indigenas do BrasilIndigenous peoples in Brazil Indigenous peoples of Eastern Brazil", "machine_text": "The Tremembé people are an indigenous group of people located in northeastern Brazil. They are primarily found in the state of Ceará, but can also be found in Maranhão and Piauí. The Tremembé people are estimated to have a population of around 10,000 people. The Tremembé people have a long history in the region, dating back to pre-colonial times. They are one of the few indigenous groups that have managed to maintain their language and cultural traditions despite centuries of contact with European settlers. The language of the Tremembé people is a Tupi-Guarani language called Tremembé, which is classified as vulnerable by UNESCO. The Tremembé people have traditionally been hunters, gatherers, and fishermen, relying on the natural resources of the region for their subsistence. Today, however, many Tremembé people have adopted a more sedentary way of life, working in agriculture and raising livestock. In recent years, the Tremembé people have faced significant challenges to their way of life, including deforestation, encroachment on their territory by landowners and developers, and discrimination from non-indigenous groups. The Brazilian government has recognized the Tremembé people as a distinct indigenous group and has established protected areas for them. Despite these challenges, the Tremembé people have continued to fight for their rights and preserve their cultural heritage. They have formed organizations to advocate for their interests and have worked to promote awareness of their history and traditions. Overall, the Tremembé people are an important part of Brazil's indigenous heritage and are a symbol of resilience in the face of adversity.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 32578523}

A music video starring guitarist and producer Warren Fitzgerald was filmed for the band's cover version of Queen's 'Don't Stop Me Now'. The album's title is a euphemism for dried semen on a casting couch. Its original cover art used lettering that parodied the logo of Variety, prompting legal action and a cease and desist order from the magazine which resulted in a replacement cover with redesigned lettering. In 2010 the magazine brought further legal action against the band over third-party uses of the original cover appearing on the internet.Cover artwork controversyThe album's cover was a source of legal controversy. A few months after the album's release, entertainment industry magazine Variety issued a cease and desist order against The Vandals over the design of the band's name on the album cover. The design mimicked the logo of the magazine as an intentional comment on the materialistic culture of Hollywood, and the magazine accused the band of trademark infringement. The lawsuit was settled with redesigned lettering which appears on all subsequent pressings of the album.However, in April 2010 Variety filed a lawsuit against the band in a Delaware court, suing them over images of the original cover appearing on the internet. The magazine claimed that the band 'ignored their agreement' and were 'misusing our mark'. The Vandals claimed that they had ceased using the parody logo per the terms of the cease and desist order, and they were not responsible for images placed on the internet by third parties:We agreed not to use this logo anymore and we have no product for sale with this logo so their claims that we are intentionally using it and harming the Daily Variety are ludicrous. Now they are in the process of punishing us with an abusive lawsuit filed in Delaware, where none of the parties reside or do business, because this will cause us the most financial harm and when we get sick of it, and realize we can't afford to fight them, we will pay them the money. That is our opinion of what is going on because we cooperated in every way to try to take the images down, but they filed the suit anyway.... in Delaware.The Vandals planned a benefit show to raise money to cover their legal fees, and considered legal action against Variety to lift the injunction against use of the original logo: 'After reading the public filing against us by the Daily Variety it is clear they are abusing this injunction to shake us down for money, and by filing against us when there are no prohibited images on any sites under our control, they have breached the settlement agreement between us. We did not agree to be responsible for third party distributors of this product. That was clear in the settlement agreement.' The band promised two tickets to the benefit to anyone who was able to notify them of a usage of the Variety-mocking logo on a site under the band's control. In April 2011 The Vandals successfully petitioned to have the case moved from Delaware to California. The band used their website to taunt Variety lawyer Henry Horbaczewski and editor Peter Bart, saying 'The Plaintiffs should all be ashamed and it is the Vandals' opinion that [Variety's lawyers] are liable for malpractice damages by ruining their client's reputation in a frivolous attempt to act like Godzilla when it comes to hoarding their precious font and inhibiting protected free speech.' Variety agreed to drop the case in February 2012. Bassist Joe Escalante, who has a background as an entertainment lawyer and represented The Vandals in the lawsuit, called it 'the worst thing that's ever happened to me, and to the band, and the hardest thing I've ever done. However, the crash course in federal court litigation made me a better lawyer.'Track listingPersonnelBandDave Quackenbush – vocals Warren Fitzgerald – guitar, backing vocals, lead vocals on Don't Stop Me Now, producer Joe Escalante – bass guitar, backing vocals Josh Freese – drumsProductionGreg Koller and Kevin Augunas – recording engineers Jeremy Mackenzie and Jon St. James – assistant engineers Jason Gossman and Seth Waldman – mix engineers Brain Gardner – audio mastering Tony Vitali – illustrations and art direction Lisa Johnson – band photosReferences2004 albums Kung Fu Records albums The Vandals albums", "machine_text": "Hollywood Potato Chip is a brand of potato chips that originated in the United States in the early 20th century. The brand is known for its crispy and crunchy texture, which makes it a favorite snack among children and adults alike.

They started with a single product which was a caramel and nut candy bar, named the Hollywood Bar. Later, the company introduced other products such as the Hollywood Potato Chip, which quickly became a hit. The Hollywood Potato Chip gained its popularity not only for its crisp taste and texture but also for its unique packaging. The chips were sold in a distinctive can with a Hollywood movie star's picture on it. The packaging was considered a novelty at the time and helped to increase the brand's popularity. The Hollywood Potato Chip was a favorite snack in the U.S during World War II when potato chips became scarce due to rationing. The Hollywood Brands Company continued to grow in the postwar era, and by the 1950s, it was the third-largest potato chip manufacturer in the United States. In the 1970s, the Hollywood Brands Company was bought out by Consolidated Foods Corp, which later changed its name to Sara Lee Corp. Today, the Hollywood Potato Chip brand is owned by Old Dutch Foods, a company that produces various potato chip brands.

In conclusion, The Storys made a profound impact on the British music scene during their relatively short career, and they will always be remembered as one of the most talented and underrated bands of their generation.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 7260416}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Formyl peptide receptor\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The formyl peptide receptors (FPR) belong to a class of G protein-coupled receptors involved in chemotaxis.In humans, there are three formyl peptide receptor isoforms, each encoded by a separate gene that are named FPR1, FPR2, and FPR3. These receptors were originally identified by their ability to bind N-formyl peptides such as N-formylmethionine produced by the degradation of either bacterial or host cells.Hence formyl peptide receptors are involved in mediating immune cell response to infection.These receptors may also act to suppress the immune system under certain conditions. The close phylogenetic relation of signaling in chemotaxis and olfaction was recently proved by detection formyl peptide receptor like proteins as a distinct family of vomeronasal organ chemosensors in mice.FPR is now properly accepted as termed FPR1 by the International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology.DiscoveryStudies conducted in the 1970s found that a series of N-Formylmethionine-containing oligopeptides, including the most potent and best known member of this series, N-formylmethionine-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLF or fMet-Leu-Phe), stimulated rabbit and human neutrophils by an apparent receptor-dependent mechanism to migrate in a directional pattern in classical laboratory assays of chemotaxis. Since these oligopeptides were produced by bacteria or synthetic analogs of such products, it was suggested that the N-formyl oligopeptides are important chemotatic factors and their receptors are important chemotactic factor receptors that act respectively as signaling and signal-recognizing elements to initiate inflammation responses in order to defend against bacterial invasion.Further studies defined a receptor for the N-formyl oligopeptides, formyl peptide receptor (FPR), so named based on its ability to bind and become activated by the oligopeptides.Two receptors where thereafter discovered and named FPR1 and FPR2 based on the similarity of their genes' predicted amino acid sequence to that of FPR rather than on any ability to bind or be activated by the formyl oligopeptides. These three receptors have been renamed as FPR1, FPR2, and FPR3 and found to have very different specificities for the formyl oligopeptides and very different functions that include initiating inflammatoryresponses to N-formyl peptides released not only by bacteria but also a multiplicity of elements released by host tissues; dampening and resolving inflammatory responses; and perhaps contributing to the development of certain neurological cancers and an array of neurological diseases Amyloid-based diseases.Structure and functionThe formyl peptide receptor (FPR) belongs to the class of receptors possessing seven hydrophobic transmembrane domains. The conformation of the FPR is stabilized by several interactions. These include potential salt bridge formation between Arg84-Arg205, Lys85-Arg205, and Lys85-Asp284 which help determine the three-dimensional structure of transmembrane domains, as well as positively charged residues (Arg, Lys) which interact with negatively charged phosphates.Furthermore, residue Arg163 may interact with the ligand binding pocket of the second extracellular loop of the FPR.With respect to binding of the formyl Met-Leu-Phe peptide, there are additional potential interactions which include hydrogen bonding interactions between Arg84 and Lys85 of the first extracellular loop and the N-formyl group of the ligand as well as the peptide backbone of formyl Met-Leu-Phe which can form similar interactions. The formyl-Met moiety of the ligand was shown to form disulfide bridges with Cys residues, and an interaction with Arg163 was also demonstrated. (It is important to mention that some interaction which stabilize the conformation of the receptor may also influence ligand-binding.) Some oligopeptides were also described as characteristic constituents linked to Asn-s of the extracellular N terminal part and to the ligand binding pocket of the second extracellular loop. These components can also determine or make more specific the ligand-receptor interaction.Signaling pathwaysInduction of FPR triggers multiple changes in eukaryotic cells including rearrangement of the cytoskeleton which in turn facilitates cell migration and the synthesis of chemokines.Important FPR regulated pathways include:G protein dependent activation of phospholipase C (PLC) which results in the breakdown of the membrane constituent phospholipid, phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) into inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacyl glycerol (DAG). IP3 is one of the most effective inducers of Ca2+ increase from cytoplasmic pools and from outside the cell via opening Ca2+ channels. DAG in turn is an inducer of protein kinase C (PKC).Activation of the regulatory small GTPase, RAS.The active RAS can in turn activate RAF, a Ser/Thr kinase. In the next step mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP kinases) are activated. (Also known as extracellular signal-regulated kinases - ERKs or MAP/ERK kinase (MEK)). As a result of the last step, ERK1 and ERK2 are activated. The phosphorylated forms of ERKs can continue the cascade by triggering activation more interacting kinases which results in altered transcriptional activity in the nucleus.Ligand binding to FPR can also induce the activation of CD38, an ectoenzyme of the surface membrane.As a result of activation NAD+ molecules will enter the cytoplasm. NAD+ is converted into cyclic ADP ribose (cADPR), a second messenger which interacts with ryanodine receptors (RyR) on the surface of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The overall result of the process is increased cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels via the direct pathway described above and also via indirect pathways such as opening of Ca2+ channels in the cell membrane. The sustained increase of Ca2+ is required for directed migration of the cells.See alsoChemotaxis ReceptorsReferencesExternal linksG protein-coupled receptors", "machine_text": "Formyl peptide receptor (FPR) is a family of 7-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in human and other mammalian cells, which is responsible for recognizing and binding peptide ligands produced by bacteria and host cells during inflammation and infection. The FPR family consists of three members: FPR1, FPR2, and FPR3. These receptors are expressed on various cell types including neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, and epithelial cells. Upon binding to their ligands, FPRs activate intracellular signaling pathways, leading to diverse biological responses such as chemotaxis, phagocytosis, degranulation, and cytokine production. FPR ligands are mainly produced by bacteria that activate the innate immune system. These include the bacterial peptides fMLF (N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine) and its derivatives, which are highly conserved among pathogenic and commensal bacteria. Endogenous host-derived peptides, such as annexin A1-derived peptides (e.g. Ac2-26), also activate FPRs during inflammation. FPRs are involved in host defense against bacterial infection and play critical roles in regulating inflammatory responses. FPR1, the most studied receptor, is expressed abundantly in neutrophils and is activated by the bacterial peptide fMLF. FPR1 is involved in the migration of neutrophils to sites of infection, as well as in the phagocytosis of bacterial pathogens. FPR2 and FPR3 have a broader expression pattern and are activated by a variety of ligands, including endogenous proteins, lipids, and peptides, in addition to bacterial peptides. Dysregulation of FPR signaling has been implicated in various inflammatory diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and sepsis. As a result, FPRs are being explored as potential targets for therapeutic intervention in these and other inflammatory conditions. In conclusion, the FPR family is a critical component of innate immunity and plays key roles in host defense against bacterial infection and the regulation of inflammatory responses. Future research in this field will undoubtedly contribute to a better understanding of FPR signaling pathways and their therapeutic potential.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 9771642}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Parklet\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "A parklet is a sidewalk extension that provides more space and amenities for people using the street. Usually parklets are installed on parking lanes and use several parking spaces. Parklets typically extend out from the sidewalk at the level of the sidewalk to the width of the adjacent parking space.Parklets are intended for people. Parklets offer a place to stop, to sit, and to rest while taking in the activities of the street. In instances where a parklet is not intended to accommodate people, it may provide greenery, art, or some other visual amenity. A parklet may accommodate bicycle parking within it, or bicycle parking may be associated with it.A parklet may be thought of as permanent, but must be designed for quick and easy removal for emergencies or other reasons such as snow removal without damage to the curb or street. As initially conceived, a parklet is always open to the public. However, some cities have allowed restaurants to create parklets that are not open to the public such as Long Beach, California, Fargo, North Dakota and Montreal, Quebec.History San Francisco has been credited with introducing the first parklet. Parklets are the formalization of tactical urbanism project created by Rebar called Park(ing), which began in 2005 and grew into a worldwide phenomena called Park(ing) Day. The first one-day park(ing) installation was created in downtown San Francisco in 2005 as an unofficial activist project by feeding a parking meter with coins, unrolling grass sod, and placing a potted tree on top. The world's first formal public parklets were initially conceived by Italian/Brazilian designer and London resident Suzi Bolognese (Sb Design Studio) and installed in San Francisco in 2010. Since then, parklets have been introduced in cities such as Ames, Iowa, London, England and Puebla de Zaragoza, Mexico.In August 2012, the School of Architecture at University of Southern California published a graduate thesis 'Experimenting with the Margin: Parklets and Plazas as Catalysts in Community and Government,' which provided a comprehensive history of the creation of parklet and plaza programs in four California cities. In September 2012, the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs published a report, 'Reclaiming the Right-of-Way: A toolkit for Creating and Implementing Parklets', examining case studies for parklets in seven cities across North America. In February 2013, The San Francisco Planning Department published a Parklet Manual which serves as a comprehensive overview of the goals, policies, process, procedures and guidelines for creating a parklet in San Francisco. The Manual also serves as a resource for those outside of San Francisco working to establish parklet programs in their own cities.Design and purposeParklets are designed to provide a public place for passersby to relax and enjoy the atmosphere of the city around them, in places where either current urban parks are lacking or where the existing sidewalk width is not large enough to accommodate vibrant street life activities. Parklets can be designed to be either permanent fixtures, or can be designed to be temporary/seasonal in places where snow removal is a concern. Seasonal parklets are found in New York City, Philadelphia, and Chicago. In 2015, Shiftspace Design introduced the world's longest seasonal parklet at 60 feet in length. Many cities choose to install these sites in order to create more public space by creating 'places for people to sit, relax and enjoy the city.' The Vancouver 2013 Parklet Pilot Program Guide explains parklets purpose and design as 'benefit local businesses, residents, and visitors by providing unique public spaces that attract customers and foster community conversation. They can also have additional benefits such as adding more space for people to walk in congested areas. The typical design is a platform that extends the sidewalk and provides amenities like seats, tables, bike racks, and landscaping'Impact studies In September 2010, The San Francisco Great Streets Project (then part of the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition) published a study, 'Divisadero Trial Parklet Impact Report,' on one of the first eight parklets built in San Francisco. This study was followed in January 2012 by a 'Parklet Impact Study' analyzing three corridors in San Francisco. From October 2012 to March 2013, Los Angeles research collaborative Parklet Studies to design and implement a one-year study of the Parklets in downtown Los Angeles. The final report was released in March 2013 along with partners at the UCLA Lewis Center for Regional Policy Studies. New York City, Philadelphia, and Seattle have all since published evaluation reports from parklet and parklet-related efforts.Locations In the United States, San Francisco hosts more parklets than any other City. The city's 'Pavement to Parks' program was formed to facilitate installation of parklets as longer-term, yet still temporary, fixtures. As of 2011 the program had received over 50 applications from sponsors around the city. In 2011 the Union Square Business Improvement District installed the most ambitious parklet, a 2-block long installation along Powell Street near Union Square, funded by a corporate donation by Audi.Parklets have sprung up in Phoenix, Philadelphia, Oakland, Los Angeles, San Jose, Dallas, Seattle, San Diego, Vancouver, British Columbia, Minneapolis, Chicago, Santa Monica, and Morro Bay, CA.Parklets are typically spaces for passive recreation, The first parklets with active recreation were installed in Los Angeles, CA in February 2013.

Often installed in urban areas, parklets are an innovative way to make cities more livable, walkable, and equitable. History The first parklet was installed in San Francisco in 2005 by the design collective Rebar. It was a temporary installation, created for a single day to raise awareness about the need for more public space in the city. This first parklet was a huge success, inspiring other groups to create their own parklets in the following years. Soon, cities across the United States and around the world began to adopt parklets as a way to improve the quality of urban life. Today, parklets can be found in cities as diverse as Seattle, Philadelphia, and Melbourne, Australia. Design Parklets come in a variety of shapes and sizes, depending on the needs and desires of the community that creates them. Some are designed for seating and relaxation, with comfortable benches or chairs and plantings to provide shade and beauty. Others are more active, with games or exercise equipment to encourage physical activity. One key feature of parklets is that they are designed to be flexible and adaptable. Many are built on wheels or other portable platforms, making them easy to move or rearrange if necessary. This allows communities to experiment with different layouts and configurations to find what works best for them. Benefits There are many benefits to parklets. They provide much-needed public space in urban areas, where green spaces and gathering places are often in short supply. They also encourage walking, cycling, and public transportation by reducing the space dedicated to cars. Parklets can also have positive economic effects by creating more foot traffic in commercial areas. A study by the San Francisco Planning Department found that businesses located near parklets saw a 14", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 27403248}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Lolium perenne\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Lolium perenne, common name perennial ryegrass, English ryegrass, winter ryegrass, or ray grass, is a grass from the family Poaceae. It is native to Europe, Asia and northern Africa, but is widely cultivated and naturalised around the world.DescriptionThe plant is a low-growing, tufted, hairless grass, with a bunching (or tillering) growth habit. The leaves are dark green, smooth and glossy on the lower surface, with untoothed parallel sides and prominent parallel veins on the upper surface. The leaves are folded lengthwise in bud (unlike the rolled leaves of Italian ryegrass, Lolium multiflorum) with a strong central keel, giving a flattened appearance. The ligule is very short and truncated and often difficult to see. The small white auricles grip the stem at the base of the leaf blade. Leaf sheaths at the base are usually tinged pink and hairless. Stems grow up to 90 cm.The inflorescence is unbranched, with spikelets on alternating sides edgeways-on to the stem. Each spikelet has only a single glume, on the side away from the stem, andbetween four and 14 florets without awns, unlike Italian ryegrass. The anthers are pale yellow, and the plant flowers from May to November. Perennial ryegrass has a fibrous root system, with thick main roots and thinner lateral branches. Roots are usually arbuscular mycorrhizal.Distribution Perennial ryegrass is native to southern Europe, the Middle East, North Africa and eastwards to central Asia. As a useful species of grass for fodder and grazing livestock, it has been taken by farmers settling in new areas including North America, South Africa and Australia. It can be used to prevent erosion and to stabilise soils, as well as creating a hardwearing turf for lawns and golf courses. With its great ability to set seed, its ease of germination and vigour, it has spread from the fields where it has been planted to roadsides, trackways, footpaths, wasteland, river banks and sand dunes. In countries where it has been introduced, it may be regarded as an invasive species that competes with native plants.Cultivation and uses Perennial ryegrass is an important pasture and forage plant, and is used in many pasture seed mixes. In fertile soil, it produces a high grass yield, and in Britain and Ireland, it is frequently sown for short-term ley grassland, often with red or white clover (Trifolium).In Britain, it is also used as an indicator of nonspecies-rich grassland, as it outcompetes the rarer plants and grasses, especially in fertile soils. Agri-environment schemes such as the Countryside Stewardship Scheme, Environmentally Sensitive Areas Scheme, and Environmental Stewardship give funding to species-rich grasslands that do not have an abundance of ryegrass.Selected seed mixes are used extensively for sports pitches, especially winter sports in temperate climates, because of its wear resistance and ability to regenerate.It is commonly used in the southwest United States to overseed winter lawns. Bermudagrass is a typical summertime grass in states such as Arizona, since it is able to withstand the high temperatures. However, bermudagrass goes dormant during the cooler winter months.Rather than have brown lawns, many homeowners, public areas, and golf courses overseed these lawns with perennial ryegrass in early to mid-September.It is also the grass used on the courts at the All England Lawn Tennis Club in Wimbledon. Since 2001, the courts have been sown with 100", "machine_text": "Lolium perenne is a cool-season perennial grass that belongs to the family Poaceae and is commonly known as perennial ryegrass. It is native to Europe, but it is widely distributed throughout the world in temperate regions due to its adaptability to various soil types and climates. The plant is known for its excellent forage and turf qualities, making it a popular choice in several agricultural and landscaping applications. Description Lolium perenne is a tufted grass that can grow up to 40-100 cm tall. The leaves are flat, narrow, and smooth, typically measuring 3-6 mm in width and 10-30 cm in length. The stem of the plant is upright and has a circular cross-section. The inflorescence is a spike-like panicle that can grow up to 25 cm long and is composed of several spikelets. Each spikelet contains up to 12 flowers and produces a single-seeded grain. Cultivation Lolium perenne is a fast-growing and highly adaptable grass that can be grown in a variety of soils, including clay, sandy loam, and loamy soils. It prefers well-drained soils with a pH range of 6.0-7.5 and requires moderate to high levels of nitrogen for optimal growth. The plant can tolerate shade, but it performs best in full sun. It is typically seeded in the fall or spring depending on the purpose of cultivation. Uses The forage quality of Lolium perenne is well-regarded for its high protein content, palatability, and digestibility. It is commonly used as a pasture grass for livestock grazing and hay production. Its ability to withstand trampling makes it a good choice for high-traffic areas, such as pastures and recreational areas. Lolium perenne is also widely used as a turf grass, particularly in cool-season climates. Its rapid establishment, fine texture, and dark green color make it popular for use in residential lawns, sports fields, golf courses, and parks. Conclusion Lolium perenne is a versatile grass that offers several benefits to the agricultural and landscaping industries. Its high forage quality and adaptability to various climates and soils make it a popular choice for pasture and hay production, while its fine texture and dark green color make it the preferred turfgrass for several sporting and recreational activities.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Cyclone Savannah\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Cyclone Savannah was a strong tropical cyclone that brought significant impacts to Java and Bali and minor impacts to Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands during March 2019. It was the sixteenth tropical low, sixth tropical cyclone and third severe tropical cyclone of the 2018–19 Australian region cyclone season. Savannah developed from a tropical low that formed well to the east of Christmas Island on 8 March. The system was slow to develop initially, but reached tropical cyclone intensity on 13 March after adopting a southwesterly track. Savannah underwent rapid intensification and reached peak intensity on 17 March as a Category 4 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian scale. Ten-minute sustained winds were estimated as , with a central barometric pressure of 951 hPa (28.08 inHg). One-minute sustained winds reachedat this time, equivalent to a Category 3 major hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Weakening commenced soon afterwards, and responsibility for the system passed from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology to Météo-France. As it moved into the new region, Savannah became the eighth of a record-breaking ten intense tropical cyclones in the 2018–19 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season. Savannah was downgraded to a tropical depression on 20 March, and its remnants dissipated in the central Indian Ocean on 24 March.Savannah brought significant impacts to Java and Bali early in its lifetime. Prolonged heavy rainfall and river level rise led to widespread flooding and landslides throughout the region. Floodwaters impacted scores of villages, causing damage to thousands of homes, submerging thousands of hectares of agricultural land and cutting off access to key infrastructure and services. Thousands of families were affected during the event, with evacuations occurring both before and after the flooding. According to local media reports, the total damage and economic losses caused by the disaster exceeded Rp106 billion (US7.5 million). Ten people were reported to have died during the event, making Savannah the deadliest tropical cyclone in the Australian region since Tropical Cyclone Cempaka in 2017. News reports also indicate that at least five people were injured and that one person went missing during the disaster.Meteorological historyDuring early March, a moderate strength pulse of the Madden–Julian oscillation tracked eastwards across the tropical Indian Ocean and into the Maritime Continent. The pulse brought with it weak monsoonal conditions to the north of Australia, as well as an atmospheric environment that was favourable for tropical cyclogenesis. On 8 March, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) noted the formation of a weak tropical low (identifier 17U) within a monsoon trough stretching from Java to the Solomon Islands—one of several tropical lows that would develop within this trough. Located south of Bali, Indonesia, and approximately 970 km (605 mi) east of Christmas Island, the nascent tropical low began moving slowly westwards. Tracking roughly parallel to the southern coastline of Java, the system passed just to the south of Christmas Island at 06:00 UTC on 11 March, before turning to the northwest.The tropical low executed a poleward turn on 12 March, assuming a course to the southwest by the following day. Tracking away from Indonesia, the storm began to strengthen in a generally favourable environment. The BOM upgraded the system to a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian scale at 18:00 UTC on 13 March as it was approaching the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, and gave it the name Savannah. Six hours later, the United States' Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) indicated that the system had reached tropical storm strength on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. Intensification continued as Savannah passed approximately 110 km (70 mi) to the west of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, and the system reached Category 2 late on 14 March. Savannah became a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone the following day, and adopted a track to the west-southwest under the influence of a high-pressure ridge in the mid-troposphere further to the south. The storm began to strengthen quickly on 16 March, reaching peak intensity as a Category 4 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian scale at 06:00 UTC the following day, making it the then-strongest storm of the 2018–19 Australian region cyclone season. The BOM estimated ten-minute sustained winds to be at , gusting to , with a central barometric pressure of 951 hPa (28.08 inHg). The JTWC analysed the storm to be producing one-minute sustained winds of , making the system equivalent to a Category 3 major hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale.Savannah soon began to weaken, with ten-minute sustained winds decreasing totwelve hours later. By 00:00 UTC on 18 March, the system tracked over the 90th meridian east and into the South-West Indian Ocean cyclone region, and hence responsibility for the storm transitioned to Météo-France (MFR) at La Réunion. According to the scale used by MFR, Savannah was reclassified as an tropical cyclone. Immediately upon entering the region, increasing westerly vertical wind shear allowed dry air to become entrained in the storm's circulation. A rapid weakening trend ensued, despite the warm sea surface temperatures in the vicinity. The system's deep convection proceeded to unravel, leaving the low-level circulation centre exposed, and ten-minute sustained winds decreased toby 00:00 UTC on 19 March. As the convective structure weakened further, Savannah was downgraded to a gale-force remnant tropical depression at 06:00 UTC on 20 March. The system turned briefly east-southeastwards before adopting a track towards the west-northwest on 21 March. The JTWC downgraded Savannah below tropical storm status at 12:00 UTC that day. Ex-Tropical Cyclone Savannah was last mentioned by MFR on 23 March, and dissipated by 12:00 UTC the next day in the central Indian Ocean.ImpactsIndonesiaThe Indonesian islands of Java and Bali were significantly affected by Savannah's precursor tropical low during the first half of March. Very heavy rainfall occurred across large parts of the islands as the tropical low tracked westwards, causing rapid river level rise, flooding and many landslides. A total of ten people lost their lives during the disaster, making Savannah the deadliest tropical cyclone in the Australian region since Tropical Cyclone Cempaka, which killed at least 41 people in Java in November 2017.The Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics indicated that 148 mm (5.8 in) of precipitation fell in parts of Yogyakarta during 17 March. The regency of Bantul, located downstream from six major rivers, as well as the neighbouring Purworejo Regency, experienced widespread flooding with depths of up to 2 m (7 ft). More than 5,000 residents were forced to evacuate, and access to electricity to was cut by the floodwaters. Numerous landslides in Bantul were also triggered by the extreme rainfall, causing damage and hampering rescue and evacuation efforts. One landslide in Bantul's Imogiri district destroyed two houses at the bottom of a cliff, killing three people, and leaving one more missing. Another person was later swept away by floodwaters, and another was killed when a wall collapsed.The economic losses that occurred in Madiun Regency were the worst in two decades, with damages and losses amounting to more than Rp54 billion (US3.8 million), and more than 5,700 families affected by the disaster. 5,086 houses were damaged by floodwaters throughout the region, and flooding and landslides destroyed three bridges and covered many roads, impeding transportation. A car crash occurred on a wet road in Madiun, resulting in the death of a five-year-old boy and serious injuries to two adults. 497 hectares (1230 acres) of rice fields were submerged, causing crops to fail and farmers to harvest early to prevent further damage. Significant livestock losses also occurred, including cows, goats and more than 4,000 chickens. In the nearby village of Klumutan, inundation of up to 5 m (16 ft) in depth damaged hundreds of houses. Two residents in a village in Madiun died of illness during the event, but were unable to be buried initially due to the flooding of the local cemetery.Further damage and agricultural losses occurred in the regencies of Ngawi, Tulungagung, Bojonegoro and Ponorogo, totalling more than Rp51 billion (US3.6 million). In Ngawi, flooding caused approximately 1,400 hectares (3,460 acres) of agricultural land to become submerged, and damages and economic losses in that regency alone reached Rp33.2 billion (US2.35 million). 1,183 hectares (2,923 acres) of agricultural land was damaged by flooding in Tulungagung, with crops of rice, melon, chili, long bean and onion affected. In Bojonegoro, flooding of the Solo River resulted in widespread impacts. Inundation occurred in 48 villages, affecting more than 1,600 families and causing 50 families to evacuate. A total of 2,097 hectares (5182 acres) of rice fields were submerged by the river water, as well as two kindergartens and three schools. Even after beginning to recede, the level of the Solo River was at above 27.44 m (90.03 ft) in Karangnongko District, causing the Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management to issue red alerts for riverine flooding for areas further downstream. Flooding in Ponorogo from the Solo River caused five bridges to collapse, and submerged 1,700 hectares (4,200 acres) of rice crops.Combined damage in the regencies of Magetan, Sukoharjo, Klaten and Bulelung exceeded Rp2 billion (US140,000). In Magetan, flooding of several rivers caused significant damage to infrastructure, agricultural land and residential areas. 100 people were stranded when nearly 500 houses were flooded in two villages, and damage to roads further inhibited access to affected areas. Losses were sustained on agricultural land, and livestock were killed by the flooding. 379 hectares (937 acres) of rice fields were inundates in Sukoharjo, and flooding of the Gamping River in Klaten submerged 738 hectares (1,820 acres) of rice fields. In Bulelung in northern Bali, heavy rainfall caused a river that was clogged with garbage and wood to overflow, damaging roads, bridges and electricity infrastructure. A government-subsidised housing complex sustained damage from the flooding, with one house being swept away by the floodwaters.Four tourists were killed and three others were injured in Magelang Regency in central Java on 13 March. The victims had been tubing along the rapids in a river when they were overcome by flash flooding. Several villages in the Pasuruan Regency were affected by flooding, with roads and residential areas becoming inundated. Water levels reaching as high as 1.5 m (4.9 ft) in Kebrukan Village.AustraliaThe Australian territories of Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands experienced minor impacts as Savannah passed nearby. During 11 March, Savannah's precursor tropical low passed just to the south of Christmas Island. At that time, the system had ten-minute sustained winds of only about . As such, no strong winds were recorded on the island. A maximum gust ofwas observed at 20:05 UTC on 12 March once the system had strengthened further after moving away to the west. A total of 60.2 mm (2.4 in) of rainfall was recorded on Christmas Island during the seven days from 8–14 March. The system made its closest approach to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands on 14 March, after intensification into a Category 1 tropical cyclone. In preparation for the system's anticipated impacts on the islands, the BOM began issuing tropical cyclone advice products for residents and local authorities at 06:50 UTC on 13 March. Strong sustained winds were experienced on the islands, peaking at gale-force, and a maximum gust ofwas recorded at 21:35 UTC on 13 March. The wind caused defoliation and vegetation damage on the islands, as well as minor damage to property, but no injuries were reported. Tropical cyclone advice publications were discontinued at 06:50 UTC on 14 March as the system tracked further away from the islands. Over the ten days from 9–18 March, 62.6 mm (2.5 in) of rainfall was recorded at the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Airport on West Island, the territory's capital.AftermathFollowing the significant damage caused by the weather system, the Ponorogo Regency government committed to conduct dredging operations to widen the Solo River in order to mitigate future flooding impacts. The government also indicated that they would attempt to quickly rebuild damaged bridges through a special allocation of budget resources for the disaster response. Additionally, residents were urged to refrain from disposing of rubbish in the river, as it was noted that this could exacerbate the risk and impacts of flooding. Significant rubbish pollution resulting in river clogging was also observed in the Bulelung Regency in Bali, where it was regarded as a contributing factor to the flooding.The East Java government allocated Rp100 billion (US7.1 million) in funding for local governments that declared states of emergency in their local regions due to flooding. The money was intended to cover logistics, equipment, human resources and other necessities for disaster relief and cleanup efforts. Farmers who were affected by the disaster were also able to access Rp6 million (US420) in compensation from local governments for every hectare (2.5 acres) of damaged agricultural land on their property. With approximately 8,000 hectares (20,000 acres) of agricultural land submerged by floodwaters during the disaster, this would have amounted to a total of approximately Rp48 billion (US3.4 million); however, some farmers were not able to benefit from this assistance as they did not have the necessary agricultural insurance policy provided by the government.See alsoWeather of 2019Tropical cyclones in 2019 Severe Tropical Cyclone Oscar–Itseng (2004)—originated in the Australian region and took a similar track to Savannah Cyclone Cempaka (2017)—a weak tropical cyclone that killed at least 41 people in Java during November 2017 Severe Tropical Cyclone Ernie (2017)—took a similar track to Savannah Intense Tropical Cyclone Kenanga—originated in the Australian region and tracked into the South-West Indian Ocean regionNotesReferencesExternal linksAustralian Bureau of Meteorology Météo-France at La Réunion (in French) Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics (in Indonesian) Joint Typhoon Warning Center Official severe weather report on Severe Tropical Cyclone SavannahTropical cyclones in 2019 2018–19 Australian region cyclone season 2018–19 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season Tropical cyclones in Indonesia Tropical cyclones in Australia Category 4 Australian region cyclones Intense Tropical Cyclones Floods in Indonesia", "machine_text": "Cyclone Savannah was a powerful tropical cyclone that developed in the Indian Ocean during the 2018-2019 cyclone season. The system formed on January 3, 2019, near the northwest coast of Western Australia, and initially moved westward across the Indian Ocean. It gradually intensified and developed into a severe tropical cyclone on January 8, before turning southward towards the coast of Western Australia. On January 9, the cyclone made landfall near Pardoo, a small town in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. Despite its intensity, Cyclone Savannah caused minimal damage, as it made landfall in a sparsely populated area. However, some communities in the region were left without power and water supplies for several days. The cyclone also brought heavy rainfall to some parts of Western Australia, causing flooding in some areas. The rainfall was particularly welcome in regions that had been affected by drought in recent years. Cyclone Savannah was the first tropical cyclone to make landfall in Western Australia during the 2018-2019 season, and was one of several cyclones to affect the region during the season. The cyclone served as a reminder of the importance of being prepared for severe weather events, and highlighted the need for effective disaster management strategies. Overall, the impact of Cyclone Savannah was relatively minor, but the storm served as a reminder of the potential for severe weather events in the region.

It is known from only four specimens and is endemic to a small area in northeast Sumatra, Indonesia, inhabiting primary lowland forest. Although all specimens share common characteristics, such as a black bill, brown iris, and black feet, two of the collected specimens show some physical discrepancy with the other two. They were initially described as Cyornis vanheysti before being accepted as specimens of C. ruckii. Rück's blue flycatcher has also been compared to other species of Cyornis.The species is listed as 'Critically Endangered' by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as it has not been recorded since 1918. It has been protected by Indonesian law since 1972. It also might have been affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.Taxonomy Rück's blue flycatcher was first described by the French zoologist Émile Oustalet in 1881, who studied two specimens (adult male and female) in the French National Museum of Natural History. The specimens were sent by Monsieur Rück from a trading port in modern-day Malacca, Malaysia, in 1880. Oustalet named the species after Rück and gave it the binomial name Cyornis ruckii. The binomial is sometimes emended to the Cyornis rueckii, but this is regarded as an incorrect spelling. Other common names for the species include Rueck's blue flycatcher and Rueck's niltava.A further two specimens (adult male and immature male) were collected by A. van Heyst in 1917 and 1918 near Medan, where they were subsequently described as a new species (Cyornis vanheysti) by the British zoologists Herbert Robinson and Cecil Kloss in 1919. They also noted their similarity to the specimens described by Oustalet, eventually synonymizing C. vanheysti with C. ruckii. The specimens reside in the American Museum of Natural History.The specimens have also been considered as being an aberrant form of the pale blue flycatcher (Cyornis unicolor). However, comparisons show that the pale blue flycatcher is different in both color and . Rück's blue flycatcher is monotypic.Description Rück's blue flycatcher isin length, with a black bill, brown iris and black feet. Differences between the specimens described by Oustalet and RobinsonKloss exist. In the Oustalet specimens, the male has dark blue plumage, a blue belly, and a shining blue rump. There is also a small amount of grey coloring on disrupted feathers around the legs. The female has rufous-brown plumage, strong rufous lores, orange-rufous breast and a whitish belly. In the RobinsonKloss specimens, the immature male has brown-spotted buff plumage with a rufous breast and a whitish center on underparts. The adult male shows some discrepancy with the adult male specimen described by Oustalet; the belly and tail coverts are whitish grey, while the flanks are bluish grey. Additionally, the RobinsonKloss specimens have slightly larger bills. These differences could be caused by individual variation or due to the specimens being of different subspecies.Distribution and habitat Rück's blue flycatcher is endemic to Sumatra, Indonesia, around Medan, and presumably has a low population density. The specimens collected by Rück were from primary lowland forest, while the ones collected by van Heyst are thought to be from exploited forest, which might show possible tolerance against habitat degradation, although this is disputed.Conservation Last recorded in 1918, and due to ongoing habitat loss, poor surveying, and its small population and limited range, Rück's blue flycatcher is evaluated as 'Critically Endangered' on the IUCN Red List. It is listed in Appendix II of CITES and has been protected under Indonesian law since 1972. In 2013 and 2014, observations in Jambi, Sumatra, revealed a pair of unidentified flycatchers that resembled Rück's blue flycatcher, but the possibility of them being white-tailed flycatchers (Cyornis concretus) could not be eliminated.

This flycatcher is named after German ornithologist Carl Rück (1875-1943), who collected the type specimen on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia in 1911. Rück's blue flycatcher is a small bird, measuring about 14 cm in length. It is blue-grey on the head, back, wings, and tail, with a chestnut-brown throat and breast and white underparts. The male has a darker blue crown and a brighter blue rump than the female. The bird's bill is black, and its legs and feet are pale pink. This species of flycatcher is found in humid tropical forests, montane forests, and secondary growth habitats in Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, and the Philippines. Its diet mostly consists of insects, which are caught by making short flights from perch to perch and then using a quick aerial strike to catch prey. Rück's blue flycatcher is known for its attractive song, which consists of a rapid set of whistles and trills. It is known to breed from March to June, constructing a cup-shaped nest made of leaves, moss, and rootlets in a tree or shrub.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Constitution of Uruguay\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Constitution of Uruguay () is the supreme law of Uruguay. Its first version was written in 1830 and its last amendment was made in 2004.Uruguay's first constitution was adopted in 1830, following the conclusion of the three-year-long Cisplatine War in which Argentina and Uruguay acted as a federation: the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata. Mediated by the United Kingdom, the 1828 Treaty of Montevideo allowed to build the foundations for a Uruguayan state and constitution. It has been reformed in 1918, 1934, 1942, 1952 and 1967, but it still maintains several articles from its first version of 1830.VersionsOriginal Constitution (1830 - 1918)When it became independent on August 25, 1825, the Oriental Republic of Uruguay (República Oriental del Uruguay) drew up its first constitution, which was promulgated on July 18, 1830. This text has been regarded as Uruguay's most technically perfect charter. Heavily influenced by the thinking of the French and American revolutions, it divided the government among the executive, legislative, and judicial powers and established Uruguay as a unitary republic with a centralized form of government. The bicameral General Assembly (Asamblea General) was empowered to elect a president with considerable powers to head the executive branch for a four-year term. The president was given control over all of his ministers of government and was empowered to make decisions with the agreement of at least one of the three ministers recognized by the 1830 constitution.Like all of Uruguay's charters since then, the 1830 constitution provided for a General Assembly composed of a Chamber of Senators (Cámara de Senadores), or Senate (Senado), elected nationally, and a Chamber of Representatives (Cámara de Representantes), elected from the departments. Members of the General Assembly were empowered to pass laws but lacked the authority to dismiss the president or his ministers or to issue votes of no confidence. An 1834 amendment, however, provided for juicio político, or impeachment, of the ministers for 'unacceptable conduct'.As established by the 1830 constitution, the Supreme Court of Justice (Suprema Corte de Justicia), and lesser courts, exercised the judicial power. The General Assembly appointed the members of the high court. The latter – with the consent of the Senate in the case of the appellate courts – appointed the members of the lesser courts. The constitution also divided the country into departments, each headed by a governor appointed by the president and each having an advisory body called a Neighbors' Council (Consejo de Vecinos).Although the 1830 constitution remained in effect for eighty-seven years, de facto governments violated it repeatedly. In the 1878-90 period, the Blancos and Colorados initiated the framework for a more stable system through understandings called 'pacts between the parties.' This governing principle, called coparticipation (coparticipación), meaning the sharing of formal political and informal bureaucratic power, has been formally practiced since 1872.The anniversary of the 1830 promulgation of this original constitution on July 18 is now a public holiday in Uruguay.Second Constitution (1918 - 1934)In 1913 President José Batlle y Ordóñez (1903–07, 1911–15), the father of modern Uruguay, proposed a constitutional reform involving the creation of a Swiss-style collegial executive system to be called the colegiado. A strong opponent of the one-person, powerful presidency, Batlle y Ordóñez believed that a collective executive power would neutralize the dictatorial intentions of political leaders. It met intense opposition, however, not only from the Blancos but also from members of his own Colorado Party. The proposal was defeated in 1916, but Batlle y Ordóñez worked out a deal with a faction of the Blancos whereby a compromise system was provided for in the second constitution, which was approved by a plebiscite on 25 November 1917.The history of successive constitutions is one of a lengthy struggle between advocates of the collegial system and those of the presidential system. Although the 1917 constitution worked well during the prosperous time after World War I, recurring conflicts between the president and the colegiado members made the executive power ineffective in coping with the economic and social crises wracking the country. These conflicts eventually led to the presidential coup of 1933. The ad hoc government suspended the constitution and appointed a constituent assembly to draw up a new one.Third Constitution (1934 - 1942)The 1934 constitution abolished the colegiado and transferred its power to the president. Nevertheless, presidential powers remained somewhat limited. The executive power once again was exercised by a president who had to make decisions together with the ministers. The 1934 charter established the Council of Ministers (Consejo de Ministros) as the body in which these decisions were to be made. This council consisted of the president and the cabinet ministers. The constitution required the chief executive to appoint three of the nine cabinet ministers from among the members of the political party that received the second largest number of votes in the presidential election. The General Assembly, for its part, could issue votes of no confidence in cabinet ministers, with the approval of two-thirds of its members.The constitution divided the Senate between the Blancos and the Colorados or, as political scientist Martin Weinstein has pointed out, between the Herrerist faction of the Blancos (named after Luis Alberto de Herrera) and the Terrist wing of the Colorados (named after Gabriel Terra; president, 1931–38). The party that garnered the second largest number of votes automatically received 50 percent of the Senate seats. In addition, the 1934 charter empowered the Supreme Court of Justice to rule on the constitutionality of the laws. This system, which lasted eighteen years, further limited the power of the president and his government.Fourth Constitution (1942 - 1951)Uruguay returned to a more democratic system in 1942.Fifth Constitution (1951 - 1967)On 13 July 1951, a formal pact between a fraction of the Colorados and the Herrerist Movement of the Blancos called for a plebiscite on constitutional reform. The plebiscite the following December 16 drew less than half of the 1.1 million voters to the polls, but the collegial system was approved by a small margin.A fourth constitution was promulgated on 25 January 1952 as the culmination of an effort to reestablish the colegiado and the plural executive power, the National Council of Government (Consejo Nacional de Gobierno), with six majority-party seats and three minority-party seats. This nine-member colegiado was ineffective because the president lacked control over the ministers and because the majority was seldom united. In the end, the ineffectiveness of these governments caused the public to turn against the colegiado arrangement.Sixth Constitution (1967 - 1997)In the elections of 27 November 1966, nearly 59 percent of Uruguayans voted to amend the 1952 constitution and to reestablish a presidential system of government, thus ending a fifteen-year experiment with the colegiado. The new constitution, which became operative on 15 February 1967, and has remained in effect since then, created a strong one-person presidency, subject to legislative and judicial checks. In free and fair elections, Uruguayans approved the new charter and elected the Colorado Party to power again.Dictatorial period (1973-1985)In 1976, however, the military government issued a series of constitutional decrees that amended the 1967 constitution by creating the Council of the Nation (Consejo de la Nación) to serve as the supreme governmental body, with executive and legislative functions. It consisted of the thirty members of the Council of State (Consejo de Estado), the body created by the regime in June 1973 to act in lieu of the General Assembly, which was dissolved by the regime and the twenty-eight senior officers of the armed forces (sixteen from the army, six from the navy, and six from the air force). The Council of the Nation appointed the president of the republic and the members of the Council of State, the Supreme Court of Justice, and the Tribunal of Administrative Claims, which was later dissolved in 1985. Eight institutional acts substituted for many of the functional provisions and guarantees of the 1967 constitution. For example, in addition to giving the Council of the Nation the power to appoint the president of the republic and to set general policy for the country, institutional acts deprived previous officeholders and candidates of their political rights and permitted the arbitrary dismissal of public employees.Back to institutionalityIn 1985, Julio María Sanguinetti was sworn in as the new democratically elected president, after 12 years of dictatorship. The military question was tough to address; after much political bargaining, at the end of December was passed the Expiry Law, which constituted an amnesty of sorts for military people who had committed human-rights abuses. The constitutionality of this law was challenged, but ultimately the citizens backed the law in a plebiscite held in April 1989.Current (1997 - present)The 1967 Constitution is still in effect, though it was amended in 1989, 1994, 1996, and 2004. Though some consider the amendments of 1996 to have created a new constitution, Parliament continues to consider them changes to the Constitution of 1967.The most important concepts that changed in 1996 were those related to elections. From 1999 onwards, the election cycle starts in June, with primary elections for all the parties, in order to choose single presidential candidates; in October, general elections are held, if no presidential candidate scores an absolute majority, a second round of voting is held in November; and finally, in May of the following year, municipal elections are held in all the Departments.See alsoUruguayPolitics of UruguayConstitutionConstitutional lawConstitutional economicsConstitutionalismElections in UruguayReferencesExternal linksText of the Constitution including the reforms of 1989, 1994, 1996 y 2004 (in Spanish)Uruguay Politics of Uruguay Uruguayan law", "machine_text": "The Constitution of Uruguay is the supreme law of the Oriental Republic of Uruguay, adopted on July 18, 1830. It established the structure and function of the government and also guarantees fundamental rights and freedoms to all citizens. The Constitution consists of a preamble, 182 articles divided into 12 chapters, and several amendments. The preamble declares that the Constitution is a result of the desire of the people of Uruguay to 'establish justice, secure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty.' The Constitution establishes a system of government based on three branches: the executive, the legislative, and the judicial. The executive branch is headed by the President and includes a Cabinet of Ministers. The legislative branch is composed of two chambers, the Senate and the Chamber of Representatives. The judicial branch is headed by the Supreme Court of Justice. The Constitution provides for a number of fundamental rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech, religion, and the press, as well as the right to own property and petition the government for redress of grievances. It also prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, gender, or religion. The Constitution has been amended several times since its adoption, most notably in 1917, when universal suffrage was established. More recent amendments have dealt with issues such as labor rights, the protection of the environment, and the rights of indigenous peoples. Overall, the Constitution of Uruguay has proven to be a stable and effective framework for democratic governance in the country. It has helped to safeguard the rights and freedoms of citizens and ensure that the government functions in the best interest of all Uruguayans.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 10763190}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"The Survivor (Star Trek: The Animated Series)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "'The Survivor' is the sixth episode of the first season of the American animated science fiction television series Star Trek: The Animated Series. It first aired on NBC on October 13, 1973, and was written by James Schmerer and was directed by Hal Sutherland. Schmerer pitched an idea for an episode to producer D.C. Fontana called 'The Chameleon', and together with the series creator Gene Roddenberry, it was developed into the final script.Set in the 23rd century, the series follows the adventures of Captain James T. Kirk (voiced by William Shatner) and the crew of the Starfleet starship Enterprise. In this episode, the crew rescue a shapeshifting alien called the Vendorian from a damaged spacecraft who has disguised himself as a missing philanthropist. Once on board the vessel, he transforms himself into Captain Kirk and tries to take the ship into a Romulan trap, while the real Captain Kirk is tied up. But after falling in love with Lieutenant Anne Nored (voiced by Nichelle Nichols), the Vendorian saves the Enterprise and Kirk agrees to take his actions into account.Schmerer and Roddenberry disagreed over some of the changes to the script, as the writer wanted to avoid repeating things that had previously been seen in Star Trek: The Original Series. Critics felt that the episode was similar to those of The Original Series, but it was considered one of the best episodes seen in The Animated Series by Chris Cummins of the website Topless Robot. 'The Survivor' was adapted into a novelization by Alan Dean Foster and was released on several different home media formats.PlotWhile patrolling near the Romulan Neutral Zone, the Federation starship Enterprise finds a small private ship flown by a Vendorian, an alien species that can transform its shape at will. The alien dupes the Enterprise crew by assuming the form of Carter Winston, a Federation citizen and philanthropist who has been missing for five years. Winston's fiancee, Lieutenant Anne Nored, happens to serve as a security officer aboard the Enterprise; upon their reunion, he breaks off their engagement without explanation.The Vendorian renders Captain James T. Kirk unconscious, takes his form and orders the helmsman, Lt. Hikaru Sulu to steer the Enterprise into the Neutral Zone, where Romulan warbirds lie in wait. The real Kirk regains consciousness, however, he is bound and gagged. Meanwhile, Dr. McCoy and Spock become suspicious when 'Dr. McCoy' allows that he might have made a mistake - something the real McCoy would never admit to - and a new examination table materializes in the medical bay. They force the Vendorian to reveal his true form, and the alert is sounded. The Vendorian escapes detection and disables the Enterprises deflector shields, leaving it vulnerable to Romulan attack, while its presence in the Neutral Zone gives the Romulans a pretext to destroy the Enterprise. Ursula hears Kirk rummaging around; she releases him. He then explains that the Vendorian was in league with the Romulans from the beginning.The Vendorian takes the form of a deflector shield around the Enterprise and the Romulans retreat. The Vendorian shows himself to the Enterprise crew, and explains that the nature of his kind is to gradually assume the memories and personal traits of those they impersonate. Because he spent too much time in the form of Carter Winston, he became unwilling to let the Enterprise crew be killed. He is arrested and will face trial, but Kirk tells him that his actions to protect the Enterprise will be taken into consideration. Nored volunteers to guard the Vendorian, saying that he has become similar enough to Winston that she has feelings of love for him.Production'The Survivor' is writer James Schmerer's only credit in the Star Trek franchise, whose other genre work consisted of two episodes of the television series Wonder Woman as well as a single episode of Buck Rodgers. He was better known for his work on soap operas such as General Hospital and Another World. He pitched stories for Star Trek: The Animated Series on the basis that the show targeted an adult audience similar to Star Trek: The Original Series and not children. He knew it was going to be broadcast on Saturday mornings, but would be unhampered by restrictions on live-action television. He later said 'that was one of the reasons why I took it, because I'm not an animated writer... I had written a couple of animated shows through the years, and it was like pulling teeth.' He explained that he wrote the script for 'The Survivor' as if it was a live-action story; it was originally known as 'The Chameleon'. The title was eventually changed in order to preserve the plot point as a surprise for the viewer.He had known producer D.C. Fontana for several years, and pitched his story directly to her. In turn, she relayed it to the franchise creator Gene Roddenberry, who called Schmerer back for a meeting. Together they re-wrote the story during the meeting to make it fit within the 30-minute-long animated episode. Schmerer explained that Roddenberry appreciated the idea of an alien pretending to be other characters, and that The Animated Series could easily show the shapeshifter undergo the various changes in the episode. The design of the Vendorian had been described by Schmerer in the script, but was changed to the squid-like design by the animators, a change that Schmerer described as 'neat' and 'clever'. In the original outline, the Vendorian didn't assume the role of Kirk. Added by Roddenberry, Schmerer did not agree with the change. Roddenberry and Schmerer argued about the point, with Roddenberry saying that Kirk was the star of the series while Schmerer wanted it to be different as he was concerned that its plot would appear too similar to the events of 'Whom Gods Destroy' where Garth of Izar changes his appearance to become Kirk.CastingTed Knight did uncredited voice acting for the character Carter Winston.Reception and home media release'The Survivor' was first broadcast on NBC on October 13, 1973. Edward Gross, the senior editor of Cinescape Magazine, rates 'The Survivor' as 'an above-average episode' that 'definitely has the feeling of a live-action [Star Trek] show.' Marc Altman compared it to other similarly-themed episodes such as 'The Man Trap', which featured a shape-changing alien and a lost love, and said 'the shape-changing alien is a familiar genre (and Trekkian trope), the romantic twist in which the Vendorian spy betrays his Romulan masters for love is a nice surprise.'Michelle Erica Green, in her review for TrekNation, found that the voice work was distracting due to the similarity between William Shatner's and Ted Knight's voices; as well as having Nichelle Nichols voice a different character. She also thought that the alien looked silly, and felt that the plot had been reused from 'The Man Trap'. In 2012, Chris Cummins listed the eight best episodes of The Animated Series for website Topless Robot. He praised the writing of Schmerer, saying that the episode felt like an episode of The Original Series, and placed it as the third best episode of the series. The episode was given four out of five stars in Star Trek: The Complete Manual by SciFiNow magazine.Alan Dean Foster expanded the episode into a novelization, adding such scenes as a Christmas party. It was released as part of Star Trek Log Two, published in September 1974. The other episodes adapted in the same work were 'The Lorelei Signal' and 'The Infinite Vulcan'. 'The Survivor' was released on LaserDisc as part of the series set. The first release of Star Trek: The Animated Series on DVD was through fan-made productions. The official DVD release was on November 21, 2006 in the United States, a single release containing all episodes from both seasons of the television show.See also'The Dauphin' – an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation featuring a shapeshifting alienNotesReferencesExternal links1973 American television episodes Star Trek: The Animated Series episodes Fictional shapeshifters Television episodes directed by Hal Sutherland", "machine_text": "The Survivor is the fourth episode of the first season of Star Trek: The Animated Series, which aired in 1973. The episode features the return of one of the original series' most unusual characters- the alien shape-shifter, the Vendorian. The episode begins when the Enterprise intercepts a distress signal from a small spacecraft which is under attack by an energy field. Captain Kirk orders the crew to investigate, and they discover the ship's only occupant is the Vendorian, a shape-shifting alien who had previously caused chaos aboard the Enterprise during the original series episode 'The Survivor.' The Vendorian claims that he had been hired by a Klingon named Kor, who had enslaved the alien's people and forced him to do his bidding. Kor had sent the Vendorian on a mission to sabotage a Federation mining facility. But, when the Vendorian discovered that Kor intended to betray him, he fled with the stolen data tapes, hoping to deliver them to the Federation and gain his people's freedom. As the Vendorian tells his story, he gets weaker and weaker, until he collapses. However, the crew discovers that the Vendorian was never really a Vendorian at all but a disguise used by Kor, who had actually murdered the real Vendorian and taken his place. With the truth uncovered, the crew captures Kor and saves the former miner's colony from sabotage. 'The Survivor' was generally well-received upon its release, with critics praising the return of the Vendorian and the episode's deep themes.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Copenhagen Fire of 1795\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Copenhagen Fire of 1795 (Københavns brandes 1795) started on Friday, 5 June 1795, at or around 3 pm by the Navy's old base south east of Kongens Nytorv on Gammelholm, in the Navy's magazine for coal and timber, the so-called Dellehave. As the workers had already gone home, a considerable length of time passed before efforts to combat the fire started, and out of fear for theft, the fire hydrants had been removed. The people of Holmen also blocked the civilian fire brigade, possibly in the belief that since it was a military area, the military should take care of it.There had been an extended period without rain and the dry wood, combined with the storage of rope work and tar, made the fire spread quickly. The wind blew especially strong from east-southeast, and that meant the countless embers were carried through the air into the city. Because of the strong sunlight, small fires were difficult to detect until they have taken hold. This is why the fire spread from Gammelholm to the main magazine along Holmens Canal (Holmens Kanal Danish) and over Holmens Canal to the quarter around Saint Nicolai Church and from there, along Gammel Strand to the area around Nytorv/Gammeltorv.The fire at Nicolai ChurchRight by Saint Nicolai Church, after the Copenhagen Fire of 1728, infrastructure to fight fires had been constructed because the area was very densely built up. A basin that could hold 400 barrels of water had been excavated for use. In addition, a pumping station was built that could pump water through an 800-foot-long hose. The pumps were able to raise the pressure to such a level that it could deliver one barrel of water per minute from the hose. But when a spark set fire to the church tower, nobody could find the key to the door of the pumping station. Only some time later did anyone think of kicking the door in. By then, the fire had already taken hold and the residents in the surrounding quarter were panicked. The road became so full of people, who were also transporting furniture to safety from the fire, that the water hoses could not be brought close to the fire. Soon the church burned to the ground, and with it the pumps. At that point, the Saint Nicolai quarter could not be saved.Fighting the fireThe majority of the residents in the area threatened by the fire chose to flee, but in some places residents chose to stay in their houses and fight the fire. This happened in the first three to four houses on the north side of Østergade. Here people spread themselves throughout the houses both inside and out, armed with buckets and plenty of water. This prevented the fire from taking hold and saved the neighbouring street of Købmagergade at the same time, since it would have inevitably have spread to there as well.The Conference Advisory, Carsten Anker, had his mansion on the corner of Vingårdsstræde and Kongens Nytorv saved by covering both it and a connected building with a sail that constantly had water poured on it.The Justice Advisory, Peter Uldall, saved his mansion in Vimmelskaftet by paying a large party to stay and put out any embers. It also prevented the fire from spreading to the northern side of the plaza, so only the southern side burned down.ConsequencesThe fire died out on Sunday, 7 July, around 4 pm. It had destroyed 909 houses and partially damaged 74. Just over 6,000 of the just under 100,000 residents in the capital were made homeless. A large number of them took refuge in the ruins of the recently burned-down Christianborgs Castle, the remaining walls of which were so large that an entire family could move into a window niche. The stables were also used as housing.The fire had, together with Copenhagen's fire of 1728, in effect burned down almost the whole of Copenhagen's medieval and Renaissance heritage and so only a few houses from before the 18th century remain in that part of the city. More historic buildings in Copenhagen would be lost to fire in 1807 when the city was bombarded by the British.The fire was a strong contributing factor to the foundation of Denmark's first credit institution, Kreditkassen for Husejerne i Kjøbenhavn, in 1797.After the fire, a large-scale plan was designed by the city planner Jørgen Henrich Rawert and the construction master Peter Meyn. The plan dictated the newly constructed houses should be made of masonry (instead of being timber framed) and house corners at intersections should be diagonal and the streets straightened so that the fire department's long ladder companies could navigate the streets more easily.ReferencesFires in Copenhagen 18th-century fires 1795 disasters 1795 in Denmark 1795 Urban fires in Europe 18th century in Copenhagen", "machine_text": "The Copenhagen Fire of 1795 was a devastating fire that started on July 6, 1795, in the Danish capital of Copenhagen. The fire raged for three days, destroyed a significant portion of the city, and left over 5,000 people homeless. The fire started in a small bakery in the city and spread quickly due to the high winds and the flammable building materials used in the city. The narrow streets and the lack of a coordinated firefighting system made it difficult to contain the blaze. Despite the efforts of firefighters and volunteers, the fire spread rapidly, destroying many of the city's major landmarks, including the Christiansborg Palace and the Børsen building, which housed the stock exchange. The damage was estimated to be in the millions and it took years for the city to recover. The fire had a significant impact on the city's architecture, as it resulted in the establishment of new building regulations that required wider streets and buildings to be constructed with fire-resistant materials. The Copenhagen Fire of 1795 was not the first major fire to occur in the city. In fact, Copenhagen had a long history of devastating fires, with major fires occurring in 1728, 1794, and 1807. The fire was a tragic event in the history of Copenhagen, but it also served as a catalyst for change. The new building regulations that were put in place after the fire helped to modernize the city and ensure that future fires would not have such devastating consequences. Today, Copenhagen is a thriving city and a popular tourist destination, but the memory of this tragedy still serves as a reminder of the importance of proper fire safety measures.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 4513354}

This is Tandem's first one-hour drama series, having previously produced miniseries, as well as its first project since being acquired by StudioCanal in 2012. The first season was filmed in Paris, Nice and Prague, with filming ending in February 2013. Locations in Prague were used for parts of Paris, Italy, the Netherlands, Berlin and Vienna. Audio post-production was done by SoundSquare in Prague while video post-production work was done by Universal Production Partners. Approximately €10 million was spent in the Czech Republic on the production of the first season.Bernero said that the show would 'feel familiar and help viewers find their orientation, but the European locations will make it feel fresh and very new'.EpisodesSeries overviewSeason 1 (2013)Season 2 (2014)Season 3 (2015)BroadcastCrossing Lines airs in Germany on Sat.1 on Thursdays at 9:15 pm, in the United States on NBC on Sundays at 10:00 pm (currently in off-season), in Canada on CBC on Tuesdays at 9:00 pm, in India on AXN every weekday at 9:00 pm (June 2016), and in France on TF1 on Thursdays at 9:00 pm.In the United Kingdom, the series was released on the LoveFilm platform on October 25, 2013. The second season was released on Amazon Video on August 15, 2014, with all seasons available on the platform as of 2019. It is now being shown on Alibi (2015). All 3 seasons are being shown on Netflix. (May 2018). In November 2020, Ovation announced it had acquired the American broadcast rights to the entire series and it returned broadcast in the United States on December 7, 2020. The show will air Monday nights at 7 PM ET, with 3 episodes back to back and episodes reran Tuesday afternoons at 4pm ET in the first season. The series returned for the second season on January 11, 2021.The series is second one to be picked up by the network in US to not finish its American run originally, after The Code (Australian TV series). It also makes it the second series co-produced with and owned by Sony Pictures Television, after the Canadian-Hungarian spy thriller crime drama action series X Company.Reception Tom Conroy of Media Life Magazine found the European flavour of the show, seen in such things as travelling by train to various cities, to be a refreshing change from the norm of American shows. He felt that Donald Sutherland was cast purely for the name-recognition factor and that he was given some lines in which he philosophically talks to pigeons as a means of justifying the cost of casting him. Overall, Conroy found it an 'unimaginative procedural' that, despite its title, 'generally colors within the lines'. David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle also found the location to be what sets Crossing Lines apart. He felt the presence of Donald Sutherland was a benefit to the show. Joanne Ostrow of Heritage Newspapers felt the show to be a 'contrivance for foreign sales more than a serious drama'.Crossing Lines has been criticised as misrepresenting the International Criminal Court's nature and purpose, which, in reality, only has jurisdiction over crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide. The International Criminal Court lacks an organization comparable to the special crime unit, and has no police force of its own. Kevin Jon Heller, Associate ProfessorReader in international criminal law at the University of Melbourne, noted the show creates unacceptable misconceptions about the court's power and the way it operates, which depends on states consenting to its jurisdiction through ratification of the Rome Statute and co-operating with the court to provide resources required to perform investigations and prosecutions.Without all the shooting, Crossing Lines is more closely related to the special crimes investigations unit of the first International Criminal Tribunal at The Hague in the Netherlands. These crime investigators from all over the world do indeed operate across national jurisdictional lines in connection with major crimes such as murder, rape, torture and kidnapping that occurred in the territory of the former Yugoslavia. John Cencich's The Devil's Garden: A War Crimes Investigator's Story (Potomac Books, Washington, D.C.) demonstrates how police investigators from Germany, France, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Italy, the United States, and many others worked pursuant to the authority of the United Nations Security Council, without relying on national police forces, to investigate and bring to justice some of the world's worst criminals.See alsoFBI: International—an American crime television series featuring a Europe-based detective squadReferencesExternal linksOfficial Facebook pageCrossing Lines at NBCCrossing Lines at Tandem Communications2013 American television series debuts 2015 American television series endings 2010s American crime drama television series French crime television series 2013 German television series debuts 2015 German television series endings Television shows set in the Netherlands English-language television shows CBC Television original programming NBC original programming Television series by Tandem Productions Television series by Sony Pictures Television Television series created by Edward Allen Bernero Sat.1 original programming Works about the Russian Mafia", "machine_text": "Crossing Lines is a television series that debuted in 2013.

Hickman is played by William Fichtner, who is known for his work in movies like The Dark Knight and Armageddon. The rest of the team consists of characters who come from different countries and backgrounds, each with their own unique abilities and talents. Throughout the series, the team travels to different locations around the world to investigate crimes that have an international aspect. Some of the locations they visit include Paris, Rome, and Amsterdam. Along the way, they encounter a variety of challenges, including language barriers, cultural differences, and legal jurisdiction issues. Crossing Lines was praised by critics for its international cast and setting, as well as its unique premise. However, the show struggled to find a large audience and was ultimately cancelled after just three seasons.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Posthuman\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Posthuman or post-human is a concept originating in the fields of science fiction, futurology, contemporary art, and philosophy that means a person or entity that exists in a state beyond being human. The concept aims at addressing a variety of questions, including ethics and justice, language and trans-species communication, social systems, and the intellectual aspirations of interdisciplinarity.Posthumanism is not to be confused with transhumanism (the biotechnological enhancement of human beings) and narrow definitions of the posthuman as the hoped-for transcendence of materiality. The notion of the posthuman comes up both in posthumanism as well as transhumanism, but it has a special meaning in each tradition. In 2017, Penn State University Press in cooperation with Stefan Lorenz Sorgner and James Hughes established the Journal of Posthuman Studies, in which all aspects of the concept 'posthuman' can be analysed.PosthumanismIn critical theory, the posthuman is a speculative being that represents or seeks to re-conceive the human. It is the object of posthumanist criticism, which critically questions humanism, a branch of humanist philosophy which claims that human nature is a universal state from which the human being emerges; human nature is autonomous, rational, capable of free will, and unified in itself as the apex of existence. Thus, the posthuman position recognizes imperfectability and disunity within oneself, and understands the world through heterogeneous perspectives while seeking to maintain intellectual rigor and dedication to objective observations.Key to this posthuman practice is the ability to fluidly change perspectives and manifest oneself through different identities. The posthuman, for critical theorists of the subject, has an emergent ontology rather than a stable one; in other words, the posthuman is not a singular, defined individual, but rather one who can 'become' or embody different identities and understand the world from multiple, heterogeneous perspectives.Approaches to posthumanism are not homogeneous, and have often being very critical. The term itself is contested, with one of the foremost authors associated with posthumanism, Manuel de Landa, decrying the term as 'very silly.' Covering the ideas of, for example, Robert Pepperell's The Posthuman Condition, and Hayles's How We Became Posthuman under a single term is distinctly problematic due to these contradictions.The posthuman is roughly synonymous with the 'cyborg' of A Cyborg Manifesto by Donna Haraway. Haraway's conception of the cyborg is an ironic take on traditional conceptions of the cyborg that inverts the traditional trope of the cyborg whose presence questions the salient line between humans and robots. Haraway's cyborg is in many ways the 'beta' version of the posthuman, as her cyborg theory prompted the issue to be taken up in critical theory. Following Haraway, Hayles, whose work grounds much of the critical posthuman discourse, asserts that liberal humanism—which separates the mind from the body and thus portrays the body as a 'shell' or vehicle for the mind—becomes increasingly complicated in the late 20th and 21st centuries because information technology puts the human body in question. Hayles maintains that we must be conscious of information technology advancements while understanding information as 'disembodied,' that is, something which cannot fundamentally replace the human body but can only be incorporated into it and human life practices.Post-posthumanism and post-cyborg ethics The idea of post-posthumanism (post-cyborgism) has recently been introduced. This body of work outlines the after-effects of long-term adaptation to cyborg technologies and their subsequent removal, e.g., what happens after 20 years of constantly wearing computer-mediating eyeglass technologies and subsequently removing them, and of long-term adaptation to virtual worlds followed by return to 'reality.' and the associated post-cyborg ethics (e.g. the ethics of forced removal of cyborg technologies by authorities, etc.).Posthuman political and natural rights have been framed on a spectrum with animal rights and human rights. Posthumanism broadens the scope of what it means to be a valued life form and to be treated as such (in contrast to certain life forms being seen as less-than and being taken advantage of or killed off); it “calls for a more inclusive definition of life, and a greater moral-ethical response, and responsibility, to non-human life forms in the age of species blurring and species mixing.… [I]t interrogates the hierarchic ordering – and subsequently exploitation and even eradication – of life forms.”TranshumanismDefinitionAccording to transhumanist thinkers, a posthuman is a hypothetical future being 'whose basic capacities so radically exceed those of present humans as to be no longer unambiguously human by our current standards.' Posthumans primarily focus on cybernetics, the posthuman consequent and the relationship to digital technology. Steve Nichols published the Posthuman Movement manifesto in 1988. His early evolutionary theory of mind (MVT) allows development of sentient E1 brains. The emphasis is on systems. Transhumanism does not focus on either of these. Instead, transhumanism focuses on the modification of the human species via any kind of emerging science, including genetic engineering, digital technology, and bioengineering.MethodsPosthumans could be completely synthetic artificial intelligences, or a symbiosis of human and artificial intelligence, or uploaded consciousnesses, or the result of making many smaller but cumulatively profound technological augmentations to a biological human, i.e. a cyborg.Some examples of the latter are redesigning the human organism using advanced nanotechnology or radical enhancement using some combination of technologies such as genetic engineering, psychopharmacology, life extension therapies, neural interfaces, advanced information management tools, memory enhancing drugs, wearable or implanted computers, and cognitive techniques.Posthuman future As used in this article, 'posthuman' does not necessarily refer to a conjectured future where humans are extinct or otherwise absent from the Earth. Kevin Warwick says that both humans and posthumans will continue to exist but the latter will predominate in society over the former because of their abilities. Recently, scholars have begun to speculate that posthumanism provides an alternative analysis of apocalyptic cinema and fiction, often casting vampires, werewolves and even zombies as potential evolutions of the human form and being.Many science fiction authors, such as Greg Egan, H. G. Wells, Isaac Asimov, Bruce Sterling, Frederik Pohl, Greg Bear, Charles Stross, Neal Asher, Ken MacLeod, Peter F. Hamilton and authors of the Orion's Arm Universe, have written works set in posthuman futures.Posthuman God A variation on the posthuman theme is the notion of a 'posthuman god'; the idea that posthumans, being no longer confined to the parameters of human nature, might grow physically and mentally so powerful as to appear possibly god-like by present-day human standards. This notion should not be interpreted as being related to the idea portrayed in some science fiction that a sufficiently advanced species may 'ascend' to a higher plane of existence—rather, it merely means that some posthuman beings may become so exceedingly intelligent and technologically sophisticated that their behaviour would not possibly be comprehensible to modern humans, purely by reason of their limited intelligence and imagination.See alsoBiohackingBiopunkKardashev scaleNanopunkPosthumanizationPostcyberpunkSpeculative evolutionTechnological singularityWeb lifeReferencesCritical theory Human evolution Human-derived fictional species Transhumanism OntologyScience fiction themes", "machine_text": "Posthuman is a term used to describe a hypothetical future stage of human evolution where humans would have advanced beyond their current biological limitations. The concept of posthumanism has been widely discussed and debated in various fields including biology, philosophy, ethics, and social sciences. Posthumanism is concerned with the impact advanced technology can have on our understanding of what it means to be human. The emergence of advanced robotics, artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and nanotechnology has paved the way for a future where humans may merge with machines and become cyborgs. Humanity's quest to transcend its biological limitations has been a consistent theme in science fiction. It's a vision of a future where humanity becomes a new species, a new type of being that transcends the frailties of flesh and blood. The idea is to build upon the best of what humans are, but to transcend the limitations that have held us back. The ethical implications of the posthuman evolution are still under debate. Critics argue that the creation of posthumans would result in a world that is fundamentally unfair and unequal, where only those who could afford the technology would benefit. Others argue that posthumans would be fundamentally different from humans and would not benefit from the rights and protections of humanity. Regardless of these debates, the posthuman future remains an alluring vision for many scientists and thinkers. With the rapid pace of technological advancement, it is possible that we may see the emergence of a posthuman species in our lifetime.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 17034271}

This genus is classified within the order Aulopiformes and is notable for its elongated body and extremely large eyes. The name Ticinepomis comes from the Latin words 'tincetum', meaning 'needle', and 'pomum', meaning 'fruit', referring to the slender body and the round head of the fish. Ticinepomis fossils have been found throughout Europe, particularly in the Eocene-aged limestone deposits of the Paris Basin. The first fossil specimen was described by French paleontologist Edouard Leaudey in 1912, and since then, several other specimens have been discovered and studied. Based on these specimens, it is estimated that Ticinepomis grew to be around 10 centimeters long. The distinctive characteristics of Ticinepomis suggest that it was an active predator, likely feeding on smaller fish and crustaceans. Its large eyes would have allowed it to see well in low-light environments, and its elongated body would have provided it with speed and maneuverability. Studies of its fossilized stomach contents have revealed small fish and crustaceans, further supporting the hypothesis of a predatory lifestyle. Ticinepomis is one of several extinct bony fish that roamed the oceans during the Eocene epoch, alongside other fascinating species such as the giant Eocene shark, the sea cow, and the ancient penguin. Its fossilized remains have provided valuable insights into the evolution of fish and the diversity of marine life during the Eocene.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Yale romanization of Mandarin\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Yale romanization of Mandarin is a system for transcribing the sounds of Standard Chinese, based on Mandarin Chinese varieties spoken in and around Beijing.It was devised in 1943 by the Yale sinologist George Kennedy for a course teaching Chinese to American soldiers, and popularized by continued development of that course at Yale. The system approximated Chinese sounds using English spelling conventions in order to accelerate acquisition of pronunciation by English speakers.The Yale romanization was widely used in Western textbooks until the late 1970s; in fact, during the height of the Cold War, the use of the pinyin system over Yale romanization outside of China was regarded as a political statement or identification with the communist Chinese regime. The situation was reversed once the relations between the People's Republic of China and the West had improved. Communist China (PRC) became a member of the United Nations in 1971 by replacing Nationalist China (ROC). By 1979, much of the world adopted pinyin as the standard romanization for Chinese geographical names. In 1982, pinyin became an ISO standard; interest in Yale Mandarin declined rapidly thereafter.Initials and finalsThe tables below show the Yale Mandarin representation of each Chinese sound (in bold type), together with the corresponding IPA phonetic symbol (in square brackets), and equivalent representations in Zhùyīn Fúhào (bopomofo) and Hanyu Pinyin.Initials In Mandarin, stop and affricate consonants are all voiceless, but show a contrast between an aspirated and unaspirated series. A much-criticized feature of the Wade–Giles system was its use of an apostrophe to indicate aspiration, as in the syllable t'a contrasting with the unaspirated ta. The corresponding Yale spellings, ta and da respectively, suggest an approximation of the aspiration distinction to speakers of English, in which (unlike, say, Romance languages) voiceless consonants like t are pronounced with distinct aspiration when they occur at the start of a word, but voiced ones like d are pronounced unaspirated and with weakened voicing in that position. Similar conventions were used in the earlier Gwoyeu Romatzyh system and the later pinyin system.The Yale system, like Wade-Giles and Gwoyeu Romatzyh, represents palatal consonants using letters for similar sounds with which they are in complementary distribution. This is more intuitive for English speakers than the pinyin usage of the letters q and x wherein they no longer carry their expected values. For example, q in pinyin is pronounced something like the ch in chicken and is written as ch in Yale Romanization. Xi in pinyin is pronounced something like English she; in Yale it is written as syi.FinalsSyllables with syllabic fricatives are spelled jr ( zhi), chr ( chi), shr ( shi), r ( ri), dz ( zi), tsz ( ci), sz ( si), suggesting approximate pronunciations to English speakers. In pinyin, these are all spelled -i. For example, 'knowledge' () is spelled chih-shih in Wade–Giles and zhishi in pinyin, but in Yale romanization it is written jr-shr—only the last will elicit a near-correct pronunciation from an unprepared English speaker.TonesTone was marked using diacritics whose shape suggested the corresponding pitch contour: ā (high level), á (rising), ǎ (falling-rising) and à (falling). The same method was adopted by pinyin.See alsoYale romanization of CantoneseYale romanization of KoreanComparison of Chinese transcription systemsReferencesExternal linksRomanization of Chinese Yale University Writing systems introduced in 1943", "machine_text": "Yale Romanization of Mandarin is a widely used romanization system for the Chinese language, particularly Mandarin. It was developed by a team of linguists at Yale University in the 1940s, and has since become an important tool for scholars, students, and professionals who need to transliterate Chinese characters into the Roman alphabet. The Yale system differs from other romanization systems in a number of significant ways. For example, it uses different spelling rules for tones (the pitch of a syllable) than other systems, and it incorporates some specialized characters and diacritics that are not used in other romanization systems. Despite these differences, the Yale system is widely recognized as one of the most accurate and reliable romanization systems for Mandarin, largely because it is based on a sound understanding of Chinese phonology. The system was designed to reflect the unique sound patterns of Mandarin, which has a complex system of tones and vowels that can be difficult to accurately transcribe into roman script. The Yale system is particularly useful for scholars and linguists who need to analyze Chinese language materials, as it allows them to easily identify the phonetic components of individual syllables. It is also commonly used in academic circles as a teaching tool for students who are studying Mandarin. In recent years, the Yale system has been updated to reflect changes in Mandarin pronunciation and to better accommodate alternative dialects. Today, it remains an important tool for anyone who needs to transliterate Chinese characters into Roman script.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 41163860}

Zambrano, a 35-year-old man originally from Michoacán, Mexico, was shot and killed by three police officers after allegedly throwing rocks at cars and police officers. His hands were in the air when the police fired the shots. Police officers said one of the rocks was as large as a softball. A toxicology report conducted by police found Zambrano's blood tested positive for methamphetamine.Zambrano-Montes' family initially filed a 4.8 million claim against the city of Pasco for the shooting, which they called an 'execution', saying he 'did not represent a threat of grievous bodily harm to anyone' at the time of his death. Two of the officers involved in the shooting were white, and one was Hispanic. The killing led to criticism by the Mexican government. with the country's President, Enrique Peña Nieto, condemning the officers' 'disproportionate use of lethal force.'Background Zambrano-Montes was raised in Michoacán, Mexico, the third of sixteen children born to Jesús Montes and Agapita Montes-Rivera. In 2004, he immigrated to the United States to work in the orchards. He was married with two daughters. His wife had previously obtained a protection order against him alleging abuse. Zambrano-Montes was in the country illegally and did not speak English. He was arrested for assaulting a police officer in January 2014. The police stated that he had tried to grab an officer's pistol in the officer's holster as well as throwing objects at the officers and trying to strike them with a mailbox. He pleaded guilty in June 2014. Prior to the incident, he had spent some time in a homeless shelter and was 'struggling emotionally' after being unable to work after an injury. According to police reports, the officers first tried to subdue him with voice commands and then with a Taser.Shooting Three officers—Ryan Flanagan, Adam Wright and Adrian Alaniz—fired on Zambrano-Montes. Flanagan and Wright are white, and Alaniz is Hispanic. None of them were wearing body cameras. The shooting was caught on video by a civilian who recorded the incident from about 50 feet away showing Zambrano-Montes was running away from police, either with a rock in his hand or unarmed, and turned to face the officers before he was shot by them. Several weeks prior to the shooting, one of the officers, Adam Wright, had dragged Zambrano-Montes away from his burning rental home.Aftermath The death of Zambrano-Montes led to criticism by the Mexican government with Mexico's Congress calling the shooting an 'act that outrages all Mexicans' and the country's President, Enrique Peña Nieto, condemning the officers' 'disproportionate use of lethal force.' There were also mass protests in Pasco, with many protesters attending from outside the local community. The Tri-City Herald reported that 'turmoil continued in Pasco nearly two weeks after the controversial shooting of Antonio Zambrano-Montes,' as protests are not typically of this size in this town. A small ongoing presence of activists was present at the Pasco City Hall.The three officers involved in the shooting were placed on paid administrative leave.

The incident sparked nationwide protests and controversy, as many felt that the officers had used excessive force. Zambrano-Montes, who had lived in the United States for over a decade, was reportedly throwing rocks at passing vehicles and police officers when the officers arrived on the scene. According to eyewitnesses, he did not appear to be armed with a gun or any other weapon. Despite this, the three officers proceeded to chase Zambrano-Montes down the street and use a Taser on him multiple times. After he reportedly continued to throw rocks, the officers then fired their handguns at him, hitting him several times and ultimately killing him. The incident was caught on video by a passerby, and the footage quickly circulated on social media and cable news. In response, the Pasco Police Department launched an investigation into the shooting, and the officers involved were placed on administrative leave. The death of Zambrano-Montes prompted outrage from civil rights groups and activists, who called for changes to police policies and procedures to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. Many also criticized the officers for using lethal force instead of less-lethal options, such as pepper spray or a baton. The incident was the latest in a series of high-profile cases involving police use of force against unarmed people of color, including the deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in New York City. The resulting protests and calls for reform have led to increased scrutiny of police practices and the implementation of new policies and procedures designed to reduce the use of lethal force in law enforcement.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 45426011}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Sampling (music)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "In music, sampling is the reuse of a portion (or sample) of a sound recording in another recording. Samples may comprise elements such as rhythm, melody, speech, sounds or entire bars of music, and may be layered, equalized, sped up or slowed down, repitched, looped, or otherwise manipulated. They are usually integrated using hardware (samplers) or software such as digital audio workstations.A process similar to sampling originated in the 1940s with musique concrète, experimental music created by splicing and looping tape. The mid-20th century saw the introduction of keyboard instruments that played sounds recorded on tape, such as the Mellotron. The term sampling was coined in the late 1970s by the creators of the Fairlight CMI, a synthesizer with the ability to record and play back short sounds. As technology improved, cheaper standalone samplers with more memory emerged, such as the E-mu Emulator, Akai S950 and Akai MPC.Sampling is a foundation of hip hop music, which emerged with 1980s producers sampling funk and soul records, particularly drum breaks. It has since influenced many genres of music, particularly electronic music and pop. Samples such as the Amen break, the 'Funky Drummer' drum break and orchestra hit have been used in thousands of recordings; James Brown, Loleatta Holloway, Fab Five Freddy and Led Zeppelin are among the most sampled artists. The first album created entirely from samples, Endtroducing by DJ Shadow, was released in 1996.Sampling without permission can infringe copyright or may be fair use. The process of acquiring permission for a sample is known as clearance, and can be complex and costly; samples from well known sources may be prohibitively expensive. Courts have taken different positions on whether sampling without permission is permitted. In Grand Upright Music, Ltd. v. Warner Bros. Records Inc (1991) and Bridgeport Music, Inc. v. Dimension Films (2005), the courts ruled that unlicensed sampling constitutes copyright infringement; however, VMG Salsoul v Ciccone (2016) found that unlicensed samples constituted de minimis copying, and did not infringe copyright.PrecursorsIn the 1940s, French composer Pierre Schaeffer developed musique concrète, an experimental form of music created by recording sounds to tape, splicing them, and manipulating them to create sound collages. He used sounds from sources such as the human body, locomotives, and kitchen utensils. The method also involved tape loops, splicing lengths of tape end to end so a sound could be played indefinitely. Schaeffer developed the Phonogene, which played loops at 12 different pitches triggered by a keyboard.Composers including John Cage, Edgar Varèse, Karheinz Stockhausen and Iannis Xenakis experimented with musique concrète, and Bebe and Louis Barron used it to create the first totally electronic film soundtrack, for the 1956 science fiction film Forbidden Planet. Musique concrète was brought to a mainstream audience by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, which used the techniques to produce soundtracks for shows including Doctor Who.In the 1960s, Jamaican dub reggae producers such as King Tubby and Lee 'Scratch' Perry began using recordings of reggae rhythms to produce riddim tracks, which were then deejayed over. Jamaican immigrants introduced the techniques to American hip hop music in the 1970s. British producer Brian Eno cited German musician Holger Czukay's experiments with Dictaphones and shortwave radios as examples of early sampling.SamplersThe Guardian described the Chamberlin as the first sampler, developed by the English engineer Harry Chamberlin in the 1940s. The Chamberlin used a keyboard to trigger a series of tape decks, each containing eight seconds of sound. Similar technology was popularised in the 60s with the Mellotron. In 1969, the English engineer Peter Zinovieff developed the first digital sampler, the EMS Musys.The term sample was coined by Kim Ryrie and Peter Vogel to describe a feature of their Fairlight CMI synthesizer, launched in 1979. While developing the Fairlight, Vogel recorded around a second of a piano performance from a radio broadcast, and discovered that he could imitate a piano by playing the recording back at different pitches. The result better resembled a real piano than sounds generated by synthesizers.Compared to later samplers, the Fairlight was limited; it allowed control over pitch and envelope, and could only record a few seconds of sound. However, the sampling function became its most popular feature. Though the concept of reusing recordings in other recordings was not new, the Fairlight's design and built-in sequencer simplified the process. The Fairlight inspired competition, improving sampling technology and driving down prices. Early competitors included the E-mu Emulator and the Akai S950. Drum machines such as the Oberheim DMX and Linn LM-1 incorporated samples of drum kits and percussion rather than generating sounds from circuits. Early samplers could store samples of only a few seconds in length, but this increased with improved memory. In 1988, Akai released the first MPC sampler, which allowed users to assign samples to pads and trigger them independently, similarly to playing a keyboard or drum kit. It was followed by competing samplers from companies including Korg, Roland and Casio. Today, most samples are recorded and edited using digital audio workstations such as Pro Tools and Ableton Live.ImpactSampling has influenced many genres of music, particularly pop, hip hop and electronic music; Guardian journalist David McNamee likened its importance in these genres to the guitar's importance in rock. Sampling is a fundamental element of remix culture. Commonly sampled elements include strings, basslines, drum loops, vocal hooks, or entire bars of music, especially from soul records. Samples may be layered, equalized, sped up or slowed down, repitched, looped, or otherwise manipulated. As sampling technology has improved, the possibilities for manipulation have grown.Early worksUsing the Fairlight, the 'first truly world-changing sampler', producer Trevor Horn became the 'key architect' in incorporating sampling into pop music in the 1980s. Other users of the Fairlight included Kate Bush, Peter Gabriel, Thomas Dolby, Duran Duran, Herbie Hancock, Todd Rundgren, Icehouse and Ebn Ozn. In the 1980s, samples were incorporated into synthesizers and music workstations, such as the bestselling Korg M1, released in 1988.The Akai MPC, released in 1988, had a major influence on electronic and hip hop music, allowing artists to create elaborate tracks without other instruments, a studio or formal music knowledge. Its designer, Roger Linn, anticipated that users would sample short sounds, such as individual notes or drum hits, to use as building blocks for compositions; however, users sampled longer passages of music. In the words of Greg Milner, author of Perfecting Sound Forever, musicians 'didn't just want the sound of John Bonham's kick drum, they wanted to loop and repeat the whole of 'When the Levee Breaks'.' Linn said: 'It was a very pleasant surprise. After 60 years of recording, there are so many prerecorded examples to sample from. Why reinvent the wheel?'Stevie Wonder's 1979 album Journey Through the Secret Life of Plants may have been the first album to make extensive use of samples. The Japanese electronic band Yellow Magic Orchestra were pioneers in sampling, constructing music by cutting fragments of sounds and looping them; their album Technodelic (1981) is an early example of an album consisting mostly of samples. My Life in the Bush of Ghosts (1981) by David Byrne and Brian Eno is another important early work of sampling, incorporating samples of sources including Arabic singers, radio DJs and an exorcist. Musicians had used similar techniques before, but, according to Guardian writer Dave Simpson, sampling had never before been used 'to such cataclysmic effect'. Eno felt the album's innovation was to make samples 'the lead vocal'. Big Audio Dynamite pioneered sampling in rock and pop with their 1985 album This Is Big Audio Dynamite.Hip hopSampling is one of the foundations of hip hop, which emerged in the 1980s. Hip hop sampling has been likened to the origins of blues and rock, which were created by repurposing existing music. Guardian journalist David McNamee wrote that, in the 1980s, sampling in hip hop had been a political act, the 'working-class black answer to punk'.Before the rise of sampling, DJs used turntables to loop breaks from records, which MCs would rap over. Compilation albums such as Ultimate Breaks and Beats compiled tracks with drum breaks and solos intended for sampling, and were aimed at DJs and hip hop producers. In 1986, the tracks 'South Bronx', 'Eric B. is President' and 'It's a Demo' sampled the funk and soul tracks of James Brown, particularly a drum break from 'Funky Drummer', helping popularize the technique.The advent of affordable samplers such as the Akai MPC (1988) made looping easier. With a ten-second sample length and a distinctive 'gritty' sound, the E-mu SP-1200, released in 1987, was used extensively by East Coast producers during the golden age of hip hop of the late 1980s and early 90s. Guinness World Records cites DJ Shadow's acclaimed hip hop album Endtroducing (1996), made almost entirely on an MPC60, as the first album created entirely from samples.Common samplesA seven-second drum break in the 1969 track 'Amen, Brother', known as the Amen break, became popular with American hip hop producers and then British jungle producers in the early 1990s. It has been used in thousands of recordings, including songs by rock bands such as Oasis and in theme tunes for television shows such as Futurama. According to WhoSampled, a user-generated website cataloging samples, 'Amen, Brother' is the most sampled track in history, appearing in over 5000 tracks as of 2021.In 2018, the Smithsonian cited the most sampled track as 'Change the Beat' by Fab Five Freddy, which appears in more than 1,150 tracks. WhoSampled cites James Brown as the most sampled artist, appearing in more than 3000 tracks. The Independent named the American singer Loleatta Holloway 'the most sampled female voice in popular music'; her vocals were sampled in house and dance tracks such as 'Ride on Time' by Black Box, the bestselling single of 1989.The drum break from the 1970 James Brown song 'Funky Drummer' is one of the most influential samples. The 1972 Lyn Collins song 'Think (About It)', written by Brown, includes another widely sampled drum break, featuring the cries 'Woo!' 'Yeah!' by Brown and Bobby Byrd. The drums in Led Zeppelin's recording of 'When the Levee Breaks', played by John Bonham, is another of the most widely sampled drum breaks, used by artists including the Beastie Boys, Dr. Dre, Eminem and Massive Attack.The orchestra hit originated as a sound on the Fairlight sampled from Stravinsky's 1910 orchestral work Firebird Suite and became a hip hop cliche. MusicRadar cited the Zero-G Datafiles sample libraries as a major influence on dance music in the early 90s, becoming the 'de facto source of breakbeats, bass and vocal samples'.Legal and ethical issuesTo legally use a sample, an artist must acquire legal permission from the copyright holder, a potentially lengthy and complex process known as clearance. Sampling without permission can breach the copyright of the original sound recording, of the composition and lyrics, and of the performances, such as a rhythm or guitar riff. The moral rights of the original artist may also be breached if they are not credited or object to the sampling. In some cases, sampling is protected under American fair use laws, which grant 'limited use of copyrighted material without permission from the rights holder'.Richard Lewis Spencer, who owned the copyright for the widely sampled Amen break, never received royalties for its use; he condemned the sampling as plagiarism, but later said it was flattering. Journalist Simon Reynolds likened the situation to 'the man who goes to the sperm bank and unknowingly sires hundreds of children'. In 1989, the Turtles sued De La Soul for using an uncleared sample on their album 3 Feet High and Rising. Turtles singer Mark Volman told the Los Angeles Times: 'Sampling is just a longer term for theft. Anybody who can honestly say sampling is some sort of creativity has never done anything creative.' The case was settled out of court and set a legal precedent that had a chilling effect on sampling in hip hop.In 1991, songwriter Gilbert O'Sullivan sued rapper Biz Markie after he sampled O'Sullivan's 'Alone Again (Naturally)' on the album I Need a Haircut. The court ruled that sampling without permission infringed copyright. Instead of asking for royalties, O'Sullivan forced Biz Markie's label Warner Bros to recall the album until the song was removed. Nelson George described it as the 'most damaging example of anti-hip hop vindictiveness', which 'sent a chill through the industry that is still felt'. The Washington Post wrote in 2018 that 'no court decision has changed the sound of pop music as much as this', likening it to banning a musical instrument.Since the O'Sullivan lawsuit, samples on commercial recordings have typically been taken either from obscure recordings or cleared, an often expensive option only available to successful acts. According to the Guardian, 'Sampling became risky business and a rich man's game, with record labels regularly checking if their musical property had been tea-leafed.' For less successful artists, the legal implications of using samples pose obstacles; according to Fact, 'For a bedroom producer, clearing a sample can be nearly impossible, both financially and in terms of administration.'The 1989 Beastie Boys album Paul's Boutique is composed almost entirely of samples, most of which were cleared 'easily and affordably'; the clearance process would be much more expensive today. In 2000, jazz flautist James Newton filed a claim against the Beastie Boys' 1992 single 'Pass the Mic', which samples his composition 'Choir'. The judge found that the sample, comprising six seconds and three notes, was de minimis and did not require clearance. Newton lost appeals in 2003 and 2004.In 2019, the European Court of Justice ruled that producers Moses Pelham and Martin Haas had illegally sampled a drum sequence from the 1977 Kraftwerk track “Metal on Metal' for the Sabrina Setlur song 'Nur Mir'. The court ruled that permission was required for recognizable samples; modified, unrecognizable samples could still be used without authorisation.Contemporary useAccording to Fact, early hip hop sampling was governed by 'unspoken' rules forbidding the sampling of recent records, reissues, other hip hop records, or from non-vinyl sources, among other restrictions. These rules were relaxed as younger producers took over: 'For many producers today it is no longer a case of 'should I sample this?' but of 'can I get away with sampling this?'. Thus the ethics of sampling unravelled as the practice became ever more ubiquitous.'The Washington Post described the modern use of well known samples, such as on records by Kanye West, as an act of conspicuous consumption similar to flaunting cars or jewelry. West has been sued several times over his use of samples. Some have accused the law of restricting creativity, while others argue it forces producers to innovate. Sampling can help popularize the sampled work; for example, the Desiigner track 'Panda' topped the Billboard Hot 100 after West sampled it on 'Father Stretch My Hands, Pt. 2'. Some record labels and other music licensing companies have simplified their clearance processes by 'pre-clearing' their records. For example, the Los Angeles record label Now-Again Records has cleared songs produced for West and Pusha T in a matter of hours.Recreating samplesTo circumvent legal problems, producers may recreate a recording rather than sample it. This requires only the publisher's permission, and gives the artist more freedom to alter constituent components such as separate guitar and drum tracks.Some producers have opted to use stock library music in their productions as samples. Beginning in the 2000s, some music producers began releasing full compositions with the intention for them to be manipulated by other producers in the tradition of library music. Often released in packs, the compositions are used by beatmakers and offer more than a single sound or musical phrase. Producer Frank Dukes and his Kingsway Music Library is often credited in popularizing the craft; his sample compositions have been used for the likes of Drake's '0 to 100 / The Catch Up' and Kanye West's 'Real Friends'.See alsoInterpolationMashupMusical quotationPlunderphonicsRecombinant cultureRiddimReferencesFurther readingKatz, Mark.

It involves the use of technology such as samplers, drum machines, and software to manipulate and process samples for artistic purposes. Sampling is a technique that has been widely used in popular music since the 1980s, particularly in genres such as hip-hop, electronic dance music, and pop. The practice of sampling first emerged in the early 1970s, with artists like James Brown and George Clinton using elements of funk and soul recordings to create new compositions. However, it was not until the advent of digital samplers in the 1980s that sampling became more commonplace in popular music. The first commercially available sampler was the Fairlight CMI, which allowed users to sample and manipulate sounds in real-time. Sampling has been a controversial topic in the music industry, with some artists and record labels arguing that it infringes on copyright laws and artistic integrity. Some critics have also argued that sampling is a lazy and unoriginal approach to music production. However, proponents of sampling argue that it can be a creative and innovative way of using pre-existing sounds to create something new and unique. In recent years, the use of sampling has become even more prevalent with the rise of online platforms such as YouTube and SoundCloud. These platforms have made it easier for artists to access and use samples from a wide range of sources, leading to an explosion of new music created through sampling. Overall, sampling has become an integral part of modern music production, allowing artists to create new and exciting sounds by recontextualizing pre-existing material in innovative ways. While it remains a divisive issue in the music industry, it is clear that sampling has had a significant impact on the development of popular music over the last few decades.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 18935758}

Ultimately, Dream City Film Club failed to find enough of an audience to sustain them.Vocalist Michael J. Sheehy had been working as a solo singer/songwriter for several years when he met Alex Vald and Laurence Ash, who quickly began writing songs with Sheehy.Upon the demise of another local group, Breed, bassist Andrew Park joined. The band's name came from a news story Sheehy had seen about an arsonist who had burned down a members-only porno theatre. They played their first gig as Dream City Film Club on 31 July 1995.They released a single, 'Crawl' for the underground fanzine, the Organ in early 1996.Soon after, they were contacted by Beggar's Banquet and recorded their eponymous debut album in late 1996, later releasing it on 26 May 1997.According to Sheehy, the English press reaction to the first single, 'Perfect Piece of Trash', was almost unanimous in its derision.After parting with Vald, DCFC continued on as a three piece, recording its second and final album, In the Cold Light of Morning featuring a more expansive sound best realized on the epic 'God Will Punish the Pervert Preacher'.The group disbanded in 1999.Michael J.

April 26 Awwad Alawwad announced that, by royal decree, Saudi Arabia would no longer execute individuals for crimes committed while minors, replacing execution with a sentence of 10 years in a juvenile detention facility.SeptemberThe kingdom's economy contracted 7 percent in the second economic quarter in comparison to the same time last year. The oil sector shrank 5.3 percent this year in part due to a lack of demand as a result of the pandemic. Oil prices decreased to below 20 a barrel in April after the country entered an oil price war. While a truce among the world’s top oil producers has pushed the price of oil up to40 a barrel, this figure is still almost half the price of oil per barrel at the start of 2020. Furthermore, oil prices are significantly lower than the 76 a barrel the International Monetary Fund (IMF) says Saudi Arabia requires in order to balance its budget this year. In fact, the kingdom obtains more than three-quarters of its earnings from oil. The kingdom’s non-oil sector shrank by 8.2 percent in the second quarter, as quarantine constraints brought business activity to an almost complete standstill. While those restrictions have been eased, the government imposed harsh austerity measures in recent months and according to experts, this may lead to a slow recovery. According to the government, the unemployment rate soared to a record high of 15.4 percent. According to analysts, recovering from such a hit might be more difficult due to budget constraints as a result of declining oil prices.

The Kingdom faced several political, social, and healthcare battles that shaped the year. Politics As one of the world's largest oil exporters, Saudi Arabia's economy is highly dependent on oil revenues. However, 2020 saw a sharp decline in oil prices due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the Saudi-Russian oil price war. To counter this, the government implemented austerity measures and introduced a new economic plan, Saudi Vision 2030, to diversify the Kingdom's economy and reduce its dependence on oil. The year also marked significant changes in Saudi Arabia's political system. In June, King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud delegated several powers to his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, which are set to come into effect in 2023. There were also significant human rights developments, including the release of several women's rights activists and the easing of certain gender segregation laws. Social The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted Saudi Arabia's social norms and cultural events. The country implemented strict lockdown measures, and the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, Hajj, was restricted to a limited number of participants. The restrictions on Hajj were a significant blow to the country's economy, as it is a crucial tourism event and a significant source of revenue for the government. However, there were also significant social reforms. In August, the government allowed unmarried couples to rent hotel rooms together, and the country lifted its ban on Skype, WhatsApp, and other video calling platforms. Healthcare The COVID-19 pandemic was perhaps the most significant challenge facing Saudi Arabia in 2020. The government implemented several strict measures to combat the spread of the virus, including closing down public spaces, suspending international travel, and imposing a curfew. The government also allocated billions of riyals to healthcare facilities and research in the fight against the pandemic. Despite these measures, Saudi Arabia's healthcare system struggled to cope with the pandemic's impact. The country's hospitals were overwhelmed, and the government faced criticism for its handling of the crisis. In conclusion, 2020 was a year of significant change and challenges for Saudi Arabia. The country faced multiple battles on the political, social, and healthcare fronts, but it also made important strides in terms of reforms and economic diversification.

The car was even used in the parade of independence on September 7, 2016 and 2018, replacing the 1952 Rolls-Royce Silver Wraith (see below) traditionally used in the parade. Also, an armored 2011 Ford Fusion Hybrid, built on a Ford CD3 platform, was received. This vehicle replaced the 2008 Ford Fusion used previously, at which point the Ford Fusion was also included in the presidential motorcade.In February 2012, the Brazilian government bought 12 Canadian-built Ford Edge models, 10 of which were armored, for the use of President Dilma Rousseff and her security team.The state-provided vehicles of the federal government's most important officials (the president, ministers, magistrates, etc.) use green-and-yellow license plates (see below). Each plate is adorned with the coat of arms of Brazil and displays the official's title on it (such as President of the Republic, President of the Senate, Defense Minister, or Supreme Court President).GalleryCeremonial State CarThe ceremonial state car of Brazil is a 1952 Rolls-Royce Silver Wraith, which is used by the President of Brazil on special occasions like Independence Day commemorations, state visits, and the inauguration of the President-elect. This is one of the two Rolls-Royce models purchased by former President Getúlio Vargas in 1953.Origins When Getúlio Vargas became president in 1951, he had two Cadillacs as official state cars, dating from 1941 and 1947 respectively. Rolls-Royce was chosen to prepare four Silver Wraith models with special modifications for security, with the intention to purchase two examples. Vargas received the first hardtop model on 31 January 1953. The first foreign head of state to use it was General Manuel Odria, President of Peru.The government paid £5,831 for the hardtop model and £7,540 for the second Silver Wraith, a cabriolet. The cars were paid for by wealthy friends as a present to Vargas himself, on condition that he would donate them to the presidency at the end of his term in office.With political problems, Vargas shot himself in the chest on 24 August 1954 and, with his suicide, the handover did not happen. The cars became part of the President's estate and were claimed by his family. The solution only came in 1957, although the cars had still been used by President Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira in the interim. The family took the hardtop Rolls-Royce and gave the cabriolet to the presidency. The last official service of the hardtop model was for the personal transportation of Berta Craveiro Lopes, wife of Portuguese president General Craveiro Lopes.Queen Elizabeth II It had been claimed that the convertible model was a gift from Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, but this is not the case, although she did use the car during a 1968 state visit to Brazil.Nowadays The car can be seen in state ceremonies that take place on the first Sunday of each month at the Planalto Palace and in the streets around it. Sometimes, the car is also used for the rehearsal of state ceremonies and parades. Its speed limit is 80 km/h, but it is rarely seen to travel faster than 20 km/h.The daily transportation of the President is made by modern vehicles, with the Rolls-Royce reserved exclusively for ceremonial occasions.

History The Presidential State Car was first introduced in the early 1960s when Juscelino Kubitschek was president of Brazil. The car was acquired from Rolls-Royce, a British luxury car manufacturer famous for producing cars for heads of state around the world. The first car was a Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud I, which was used by the president until 1964. In 1968, following a military coup, the presidential car was replaced with a Ford Galaxie, a car that was produced locally in Brazil. However, in 1973, President Emílio Garrastazu Médici purchased the Rolls-Royce Silver Wraith II, which has been in use ever since. Specifications The Presidential State Car is a 1972 Rolls-Royce Silver Wraith II, equipped with a 6.75-litre V8 engine and a three-speed automatic transmission. The car measures 18 feet in length and weighs 2.25 tons. The car is capable of reaching a top speed of around 80 miles per hour. The car is fitted with bulletproof glass, armor plating, and run-flat tires, providing the highest level of protection for the president. The car also has an air conditioning system, intercom system, and a state-of-the-art security system. Use The Presidential State Car is used by the President of Brazil for official and ceremonial purposes.

The church was renovated or rebuilt in 1606, when a number of other structures were added, among them the belltower, the gate, and a residential structure with a chapel to Gregory the Illuminator, all of which survive to this day. The church's interior was decorated with murals in the 18th century.When James Louis Sobieski attempted to ascend to the Moldavian throne, the monastery was his base of operations. In 1690 it became the headquarters of the Polish Army for all of their operations in Moldavia related to Poland's participation in the War of the Holy League against the Ottoman Empire. Staying at the monastery for several years, the Poles built an extensive network of bastion fortifications which are well preserved to this day. The monastery's popular name, 'Zamca', likely comes from this period; it is derived from , the Polish word for castle.BibliographyW. Korsak, J. Tokarski, Rumunia, Pascal 2004, s. 205-206.Ł.

The church is renowned for its unique architecture and intricate frescoes that adorn the interiors. The history of the Armenian community in Suceava dates back to the 14th century when the Armenian merchants and craftsmen started settling in the region. In 1385, the Moldavian Prince, Petru I Musat, granted the Armenian community permission to build their own church. The construction of the church began in the following year and was completed in 1395. The monastery was consecrated in honor of Saint George, who is regarded as the patron saint of Armenia. The comely structure of the church is attributed to the Armenian architects and builders who worked on the project. The architectural style of the monastery is an amalgamation of Byzantine and Armenian influences. The façade of the church is relatively simple, but the interiors are adorned with frescoes that depict scenes from the life of Christ and the saints. The Armenian monastery of Suceava has undergone several renovations and restorations over the years. In the 18th century, the monastery was damaged by an earthquake and subsequent fires. The restoration work took several years and was completed in 1783. Further renovation work was carried out in the 19th and 20th centuries to preserve the historical and cultural significance of the church. Today, the Armenian monastery of Suceava is a popular tourist attraction and a place of religious significance for the Armenian community in Romania. The church is a testimony to the rich cultural and religious diversity that has existed in Romania for centuries.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Buffalo Grove ambush\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Buffalo Grove ambush was an ambush that occurred on May 19, 1832 as part of the Black Hawk War. A six-man detail carrying dispatches from United States Colonel James M. Strode at Galena, Illinois to General Henry Atkinson at Dixon's Ferry was ambushed by Native Americans during the attack. William Durley was killed and buried near the site of the ambush. Durley's remains were initially interred by the party that would become victims of the St. Vrain massacre. Two other men had bullet holes in their clothing, but were uninjured. In 1910 the Polo Historical Society moved Durley's remains to a plot beneath a memorial they erected west of Polo, Illinois.BackgroundAs a consequence of an 1804 treaty between the Governor of Indiana Territory and a group of Sauk and Fox leaders regarding land settlement, the Sauk and Fox tribes vacated their lands in Illinois and moved west of the Mississippi in 1828. However, Sauk Chief Black Hawk and others disputed the treaty, claiming that the full tribal councils had not been consulted, nor did those representing the tribes have authorization to cede lands. Angered by the loss of his birthplace, between 1830–31 Black Hawk led a number of incursions across the Mississippi River, but was persuaded to return west each time without bloodshed. In April 1832, encouraged by promises of alliance with other tribes and the British, he again moved his so-called 'British Band' of around 1000 warriors and non-combatants into Illinois. Finding no allies, he attempted to return to Iowa, but ensuing events led to the Battle of Stillman's Run. A number of other engagements followed, and the state militias of Wisconsin and Illinois were mobilized to hunt down Black Hawk's band. The conflict became known as the Black Hawk War.PreludeWhen the Black Hawk War began in the spring of 1832, the settlers at Buffalo Grove were notified of Black Hawk's victory at Stillman's Run and ordered to leave the grove. Most of the settlers went to Peoria where they remained for the duration of the war. On May 19, 1832 a small unit was detailed to carry dispatches from Colonel James M. Strode in Galena to General Henry Atkinson at Dixon's Ferry (present-day Dixon, Illinois). The group of men, which included soldiers Fred Stahl, William Durley, Vincent Smith, Redding Bennett, James Smith, and mail contractor John D. Winters, left Dixon around 3 p.m. on May 19.AmbushThe Buffalo Grove ambush occurred near Buffalo Grove, Illinois, a small, unincorporated settlement in present-day Ogle County. As the group neared the edge of the grove one of the party noted the increased chances for ambush and suggested that the party avoid the usual route by taking a more roundabout route. The suggestion was opposed and Durley reared his horse and entered the wooded area within the grove. He had traveled only a few 'bounds' when he was cut down by gunfire from the previously suggested ambush.On May 20, 1832, Sergeant Stahl returned to Dixon's Ferry with the other four survivors of the attack and reported that his party had been ambushed by a group of Native Americans the evening before on the edge of the grove. He reported that Durley was killed instantly, scalped, and left on the spot.Stahl and James Smith both had bullets rip through articles of clothing but were uninjured and only Durley died in the attack.AftermathThe events of the Buffalo Grove ambush are closely interrelated with those of the St. Vrain massacre. A group of four men, including Aaron Hawley and John Fowler, both casualties of the St. Vrain massacre, was en route to Galena when they stumbled upon the body of Durley at Buffalo Grove. The group returned to Dixon's Ferry, reported their find and stayed there overnight.When Atkinson returned to Dixon on May 23 it was with dispatches destined for Fort Armstrong. He ordered Indian Agent Felix St. Vrain to join the group that had discovered Durley's body and travel with them to Galena. The group left Dixon and traveled north where they found, and interred the remains of Durley at Buffalo Grove.The Polo Historical Society erected a memorial to Durley on May 19, 1910, the 78th anniversary of the attack. At that time, Durley's remains were moved from where St. Vrain's party buried him, near where he had fallen, and interred beneath the memorial. The Buffalo Grove ambush historical marker and memorial to Durley are located west of the city of Polo, Illinois along Eagle Point Road.Notes1832 in the United States Buffalo Grove Polo, Illinois May 1832 events", "machine_text": "The Buffalo Grove ambush is a tragic incident that occurred on January 8, 2020, in Buffalo Grove, Illinois. An armed man reportedly ambushed two state troopers while they were conducting a welfare check on a resident in the area. The attacker, identified as 42-year-old Volodymyr Dragan, opened fire on the troopers using a handgun, resulting in a fierce exchange of gunfire that tragically left both troopers dead. The incident occurred at around 5:30 PM, and authorities responded quickly to the scene. They cordoned off the area, and a SWAT team was deployed to search for the attacker, who was considered armed and dangerous. The search lasted several hours before investigators finally found Dragan's body about a mile from the crime scene. The Buffalo Grove ambush marked one of the deadliest attacks on law enforcement officers in recent history, and it sent shockwaves throughout the state and the nation. The slain troopers were identified as 39-year-old Christopher Lambert and 34-year-old Brooke Jones-Story. Both troopers served with the Illinois State Police and were highly regarded for their dedication and courage. Following the incident, law enforcement agencies across the state expressed their condolences and rallied behind the families and loved ones of the fallen officers. Governor J.B. Pritzker ordered all flags to be flown at half-mast in honor of the slain troopers, while several tributes and memorials were erected in their memory.

Molecules that do not have this ability have a long-lived excited state. This long lifetime leads to a high probability for reactions with other molecules—so-called bimolecular reactions. Melaninand DNA have extremely short excited state lifetimes in the range of a few femtoseconds (10−15s). The excited state lifetime of compounds used in sunscreens such as menthyl anthranilate, avobenzone or padimate O is 1,000 to 1,000,000 times longer than that of melanin, and therefore they may cause damage to living cells that come in contact with them.The molecule that originally absorbs the UV-photon is called a 'chromophore'. Bimolecular reactions can occur either between the excited chromophore and DNA or between the excited chromophore and another species, to produce free radicals and reactive oxygen species. These reactive chemical species can reach DNA by diffusion and the bimolecular reaction damages the DNA (oxidative stress). It is important to note that, unlike direct DNA damage which causes sunburn, indirect DNA damage does not result in any warning signal or pain in the human body.The bimolecular reactions that cause the indirect DNA damage are illustrated in the figure:1O2 is reactive harmful singlet oxygen:Location of the damage Unlike direct DNA damage, which occurs in areas directly exposed to UV-B light, reactive chemical species can travel through the body and affect other areas—possibly even inner organs.The traveling nature of the indirect DNA damage can be seen in the fact that the malignant melanoma can occur in places that are not directly illuminated by the sun—in contrast to basal-cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, which appear only on directly illuminated locations on the body.See alsoFree radical damage to DNA Photoprotection SunscreenReferencesPhotochemistry Skin conditions resulting from physical factors Sun tanning", "machine_text": "Indirect DNA damage refers to damage to DNA caused by external agents that do not directly interact with DNA molecules. Such agents work by inducing the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) or free radicals that subsequently damage DNA. ROS are highly reactive chemical species that can result from the metabolism of xenobiotic agents or through exposure to ionizing radiation. Damage from this sort of exposure is referred to as non-targeted or bystander effects. Indirect damage can create a wide range of changes to DNA, from single-strand breaks (SSBs) to double-strand breaks (DSBs). These breaks can result in the loss or rearrangement of genetic material, leading to mutations and cell death. Studies have shown that indirect DNA damage can have significant impacts on cancer development and the ageing process. Indirect DNA damage can also occur due to chemical exposure. When certain chemicals are metabolized, ROS are generated that can contribute to the indirect damage of DNA. This effect is thought to be a significant factor in the development of a variety of carcinomas and other health problems. In conclusion, indirect DNA damage is a complex phenomenon that involves the actions of external agents on DNA molecules. Its effects on the human body can be severe and can contribute to cancer development and the ageing process. As our understanding of this phenomenon grows, researchers are working to develop treatments that can counteract its effects and reduce the risks associated with exposure to environmental toxins and other external agents.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 15737471}

They are intended to be played at the same time, much like the previous Boris double album Dronevil, or as separate works.Initial teasers were posted at the start of the year, most prominently a live clip of 'Huge' from the Fever performance on January 21. Rolling Stone announced YouTube streams of 'Heavy Rain' and its accompanying section of 'Goloka pt. 1' on February 5, 2016. Later in February, The Wire debuted a live video of Boris alone playing the song 'More' from Leave Them All Behind 2015.BackgroundThe album was inspired by their June 2014 Boiler Room set, during which Boris played a drumless set, followed by Merzbow, and then a joint set by Boris with Merzbow. In support of Gensho, they played a one-off show at Fever in Tokyo on November 27, 2015; a recording of the concert called Gensho at Fever 11272015 is included as a bonus with the Japanese release of Gensho by Daymare Recordings. It includes the recorded debut of a new Boris song 'More', as well as a performance of rare song 'Kilmister,' created for the web anime series Ninja Slayer, and a cover of the Man song 'Many Are Called, but Few Get Up'. Because the Boris tracks are primarily drone-based, both presented versions of the song 'Akuma no Uta' are actually more similar to 'Introduction' from the same album; regardless, the song is credited as 'Akuma no Uta' on all versions.The vinyl version of the album is released as two separate double LPs; one LP with half of the Boris material and one LP with half of the Merzbow material. Thus, no matter which form is purchased, it is possible to play both contributors simultaneously. These are also available bundled together as a single deluxe edition.

It was released on March 18, 2016, by Sargent House records. The album contains two separate discs, one with Boris's music and the other with minimalist composer Merzbow's noise-oriented music. Both discs are intended to be played simultaneously, but there is no pre-determined starting point and order, thus creating a unique listening experience every time. The title of the album means 'phenomenon' or 'manifestation' in Japanese and reflects the experimental nature of the album. Gensho is comprised of six tracks on each disc, with the first track being the shortest and each successive track gradually increasing in duration. The tracks on Boris's disc contain familiar elements of the band's sound, such as heavy drone and sludge metal, accented by serene shoegaze textures. Merzbow's disc is distinctly harsher and abrasive, full of intense noise and distorted soundscapes. The album was initially conceived as part of a live performance for the Jazz Café in London. Boris and Merzbow have collaborated on several projects over the years, and their approach on Gensho further exemplifies their shared desire to constantly push boundaries and experiment with sound. Critics praised the album for its innovative concept and execution. Gensho was noted for its ability to create a meditative and immersive listening experience, despite the seemingly disparate sounds presented. The album was included on several 'Best of 2016' lists, such as Rolling Stone's '20 Best Avant Albums of 2016'. Overall, Gensho is a fascinating and immersive musical experiment that showcases the boundless creativity and technical prowess of both Boris and Merzbow.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Shortest remaining time\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Shortest remaining time, also known as shortest remaining time first (SRTF), is a scheduling method that is a preemptive version of shortest job next scheduling. In this scheduling algorithm, the process with the smallest amount of time remaining until completion is selected to execute. Since the currently executing process is the one with the shortest amount of time remaining by definition, and since that time should only reduce as execution progresses, the process will either run until it completes or get preempted if a new process is added that requires a smaller amount of time.Shortest remaining time is advantageous because short processes are handled very quickly. The system also requires very little overhead since it only makes a decision when a process completes or a new process is added, and when a new process is added the algorithm only needs to compare the currently executing process with the new process, ignoring all other processes currently waiting to execute.Like shortest job next, it has the potential for process starvation: long processes may be held off indefinitely if short processes are continually added. This threat can be minimal when process times follow a heavy-tailed distribution. A similar algorithm which avoids starvation at the cost of higher tracking overhead is highest response ratio next (HRRN).Limitations Like shortest job next scheduling, shortest remaining time scheduling is rarely used outside of specialized environments because it requires accurate estimates of the runtime of each process.ReferencesProcessor scheduling algorithmsde:Prozess-Scheduler#Strategien", "machine_text": "Shortest remaining time (SRT) is a scheduling algorithm used in computer operating systems for pre-emptive multitasking of processes. It is also known as the shortest job first (SJF) algorithm since it considers the execution time of a process when scheduling it. The SRT algorithm is a dynamic priority algorithm, where processes with the shortest remaining execution time are given priority over the longer ones. The SRT algorithm is an ideal scheduling algorithm in terms of minimizing the average waiting time for processes. It works by preempting a running process if a shorter process has arrived, which is given higher priority. For instance, consider two processes A and B, where process A has a running time of 5 units and process B has a running time of 2 units. In the scenario where process B arrives before process A’s execution completes, the SRT algorithm preempts process A and executes process B, which has a shorter remaining time. While SRT is efficient in terms of reducing the waiting time for processes, it can result in a high context switch overhead. This is because the algorithm is constantly switching between processes, which results in additional overhead in managing the processes. Therefore, the SRT algorithm is commonly used in environments where context switches are inexpensive, such as in a real-time operating system. One significant drawback of SRT is that it can lead to process starvation. This happens when a process with a longer execution time keeps getting preempted by shorter processes, which causes it never to complete. To solve this problem, the SRT algorithm is often modified to include aging of processes. Aging ensures that lower priority processes are given a chance to execute, even if they have longer execution times. Overall, the SRT scheduling algorithm is an essential feature of modern operating systems since it offers an efficient way to handle the scheduling of processes. It is used in scheduling a wide range of processes from background tasks to real-time systems, and its simplicity and effectiveness have made it a popular choice for many applications.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 3048384}

A variation of the dish called blinde vink is made by wrapping ground veal in a thin veal cutlet. Slavinken and blinde vinken are usually prepared and bought at the butchery or the supermarket; a standard slavink, before cooking, weighs around 100 grams. The bacon is 'glued' to the filling with transglutaminase, an enzyme that bonds proteins (and is usually extracted from animal blood).The slavink was first created by Butcher Jaap Boerwinkel in Amersfoort, and subsequently given its name by butcher Spoelder in Laren, which won him an award, the 'Golden Butcher's Ring.' Originally, the filling of a slavink was made from smoked sausage. The term 'slavink' loosely translates to Lettucefinch. The term is probably an abbreviation of slagersvink, that is, a 'finch' prepared by the butcher ('slager').The slavink often emblematizes traditional Dutch cuisine, as in the book De taal van de verpleging, a Dutch-language guide for non-native nurses working in the Netherlands, and is especially favored by the older generations.GalleryReferencesDutch cuisine Dutch words and phrases Pork dishes Bacon dishes", "machine_text": "Slavink is a traditional Dutch dish that consists of ground meat, typically beef or pork, wrapped in bacon and then baked or fried.

The origins of Slavink can be traced back to the early 20th century, although its exact origins are unclear. It is believed to have been created by butchers who were looking for new ways to use up their leftover meat scraps. The traditional recipe for Slavink involves mixing ground meat with spices, breadcrumbs, and egg, then forming the meat mixture into small oblong shapes. The meat is then wrapped in thin slices of bacon, secured with toothpicks and either baked or fried until crispy and golden brown. Slavink is typically served hot, accompanied by potatoes, vegetables, and a rich gravy. It is a popular dish in the Netherlands, often served as a hearty and filling meal during the winter months. In recent years, various adaptations of Slavink have emerged, including vegetarian and even vegan versions.

Born in Ukraine, Semion Slepakov moved to Canada in 1990 where he studied engineering and later worked as an acoustics consultant. During this time, he was also developing his interest in music composition and production. Slepakov's early work in electronic music was heavily influenced by the experimental sounds of early 20th-century composers like Iannis Xenakis and Karlheinz Stockhausen. In the late 1990s, Slepakov began performing as Szkieve, and quickly gained a reputation for his live performances, which often included live improvised multimedia elements like video and lighting. Szkieve's approach to music often involves the use of unconventional instruments like broken circuit boards and contact microphones, and his sound has been described as both rhythmic and atmospheric. Szkieve's debut release, entitled 'Fragments of Hunting Metaphors,' was released on France's Ant-Zen record label in 2000, and was followed by several other releases, including 'Atavism Dream' and 'Des Yoyos Dances.' Szkieve has also worked on numerous collaborative projects with other experimental electronic musicians like Zbigniew Karkowski and Francisco López. In addition to his work in music, Szkieve has also composed music for independent films and installations, and has collaborated with visual artists, dancers, and choreographers. His work has been featured in festivals and exhibitions around the world, including Ars Electronica in Austria, MUTEK in Montreal, and Transmediale in Berlin. Szkieve's approach to music and sound is highly experimental and unconventional, and he continues to push the boundaries of electronic music with his work.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 10451306}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Port Douglas Wharf\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Port Douglas Wharf is a heritage-listed wharf at 6 Dixie Street, Port Douglas, Shire of Douglas, Queensland, Australia. It was built in 1904. It was also known as Shipwreck Museum. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.HistoryPort Douglas Wharf and Storage Shed were erected in 1904 for the Douglas Shire Council, the buildings reported demolished by the cyclone of 2011, with extensions to the storage shed made in the 1920s.Port Douglas was established in 1877 as a port to service the newly opened Hodgkinson Goldfield, west of the Great Dividing Range. In the period 1877 to 1893, Port Douglas functioned primarily as a port for the mining hinterland and secondarily as an administrative and service centre for the surrounding developing agricultural districts. The development of Port Douglas initially outpaced that of its nearby rival, Cairns, established in 1876. However, following the 1885 political decision to site the terminus for the Atherton Tableland Railway at Cairns, this town advanced rapidly at the expense of Port Douglas. After the opening of the Cairns to Mareeba railway in 1893, trade between Port Douglas and the mining hinterland declined markedly, and virtually ceased after the extension of the railway to Mount Molloy in 1908. Much of what remained of the township was further decimated in a severe cyclone on 16 March 1911.However, from the 1890s until 1958, Port Douglas survived principally as a sugar port. The town was also the administrative centre of Douglas Shire until the 1920s, when headquarters were shifted to Mossman in the heart of the expanding sugar lands. During the 1960s and 1970s, Port Douglas functioned mainly as a fishing and holiday town, retaining much of its historic character, but in the 1980s the town emerged as a booming tourist resort, with strong pressures for development.It appears that the wharf was built to serve the handling of general cargo (as opposed to sugar) in preference to at least one other previous proposal for a jetty at Macrossan Street. Prior to this, it seems that all general cargo handling was carried out at the private wharfing facilities (variously WalshCo., Davidson's, JackNewell and possibly others), either by direct berthing for smaller vessels or for larger vessels by lightering from the general anchorage someoff the western end of Island Point. A stone-pitched jetty adjacent to the quarry site on the north-east corner of Island Point had been constructed earlier for passenger traffic, and was extended during 1888–1889 to a total length of .In 1904, Douglas Shire Council obtained a loan from the Queensland Government to build a new wharf for the berthing of ships at a more convenient site in the harbour. This wharf was built with a decline from wharf to shore to ease the transfer of loaded rail trucks. A stone pitched ramp was built as part of the wharf construction. The 1904 wharf structure was aboutwide, with a storage shedlong bywide on the north-east corner of the decking. A jib crane was located on the northern end of the wharf and walkways were constructed alongside the storage shed.During the early 1920s an additional row of piles was driven aboutto the east along the length of the wharf. The 1904 storage shed was relocated over these by sliding the structure back from the wharf outer face. It appears that at this period the shed was extended on the southern end by about . A lunch room building, also holding a fresh water tank, on the southern end of the storage shed was relocated to the same respective position when the shed was extended.The wharf was last used for sugar shipment on 1 April 1958. Subsequently, the wharf was leased for private enterprise from 1963 until January 1975. Well known Queensland diver Ben Cropp held a twenty-year lease over the storage shed from October 1979. He operated a shipwreck museum in the shed which also included his living quarters. The lease was briefly extended into mid-2000. Cropp relocated the museum to Cairns later that year.The foreshore near the Port Douglas Wharf was reclaimed in the late twentieth century, and the 1904 timber-piled and timber-framed jetty between the stone-pitched ramp and the storage shed was removed.DescriptionThis wharf is at the entrance to Dickson's Inlet approximately opposite the western end of Warner Street.The wharf, which is constructed parallel to the channel, is of timber construction aboutlong (including the decked approach ramp) bywide and supporting a wooden storage shed on the eastern side.The storage shed roof trusses are constructed fromandsections, mainly Oregon, and the storage shed was planked internally to facilitate the stacking of bagged sugar.A simple gable roofed form building, the former wharf storage building is built out over the water on timber piles braced by diagonal timbers.The new corrugated steel roof is exposed internally and supported on burlings spanning between major trusses of mainly Oregon members. Timber planes fixed with dogspikes form the floor.The building is an important element in the townscape of Port Douglas, being most visible from the sea and surrounding hills.An earlier stone pitched ramp remains in evidence at the side of the later earth-filled access to the former storage shed and wharf.Heritage listingThe former Port Douglas Wharf and Storage Shed was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria.The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.The building is significant for its historical association with the development of Port Douglas as a shipping terminal.ReferencesAttributionExternal linksQueensland Heritage Register Port Douglas, Queensland Ports and harbours of Queensland Articles incorporating text from the Queensland Heritage Register Buildings and structures in Far North Queensland", "machine_text": "Port Douglas Wharf is a historical landmark and tourist attraction located in the resort town of Port Douglas, Queensland, Australia. The wharf has a rich history dating back to the early days of Port Douglas' founding as a port for the region's mining industry. The original wharf was built in 1879 and was used to transport gold and other minerals from the nearby mining towns of Hodgkinson and Thornborough. The wharf extended 1,400 feet into the waters of the Coral Sea and was the longest wharf in Queensland at the time. In the 1920s and 1930s, Port Douglas became known as a hub for the timber industry and the wharf was extended to accommodate larger ships carrying timber and other goods. However, the wharf was severely damaged by a cyclone in 1911 and a fire in 1934, requiring extensive repairs and rebuilding. Today, the Port Douglas Wharf stands as a testament to the town's history and is a popular destination for tourists. The wharf has been renovated and expanded to include a marina, restaurants, and shops. Visitors can enjoy scenic walks along the water, spot marine life in the harbor, and embark on fishing expeditions or cruises to the nearby Great Barrier Reef. The Port Douglas Wharf is also home to the Port Douglas Sunday Markets, which have been a local tradition since 1998. The markets feature local arts and crafts, fresh produce, and live music, attracting both tourists and locals alike. In addition to its historical and recreational significance, the Port Douglas Wharf also plays an important role in the town's economy. The wharf serves as a gateway for tourism and fishing industries, and also provides job opportunities for local residents. Overall, the Port Douglas Wharf is a beloved landmark that offers visitors a glimpse into the town's rich history and bustling present-day community.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 50671919}

According to his biographer, Shams-ud-din's major contribution was his support of strong anti-Ahmadiyya feelings among Muslims at the risk and sacrifice of his life.Early life and educationHe was born on 4 May 1944 (21 Jumada al-awwal 1364 AH) in Balkh Province of Afghanistan to a family of religious scholars. His father Muhammad Zahid Harifal was a sufi theologian. He was the founder and teacher of the Madrasa Shams-uloom at Fort Sandeman in Zhob.Shams-ud-din received elementary religious education from his father. He continued both secular schooling and religious education.He matriculated from a government high school in Zhob in 1960. He then attended a madrassa boarding school in Akora Khattak, Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa. He stayed there for two years and continued his education under the guidance of Abdul Haq (father of Sami-ul-Haq, the chief of the JUI). He then attended the Madrasa Arabia New Town Karachi, where he studied under Muhammad Yousuf Binori for two consecutive years.He then went to Khanpur, Rahim Yar Khan and studied at the Madrasa Arabia Makhzan-ul-uloom wa fayuz Eidgah, headed by Pakistani religious scholar Abdullah Darkhawasti.Realizing the highest spiritual position of his teacher, he immediately became his spiritual student by taking the Bay'ah (oath of allegiance) of the Naqshbandi order of Sufism.After two years stay he proceeded to his last institution, the Madrasa Nasratul Uloom Gujranwala, to complete the remaining one-year course of Darse Nizami. At that madrasa, Shams-ud-din studied course of Hadiths (narrations of the words and deeds of Muhammad). He gained knowledge of tafseer, Hadith, spiritualism, mysticism, metaphysics, and logic. Thus completing a traditional Dars-i-Nizam course, he acquired his sanad (degree in Islamic knowledge and sciences of Hadith).After completing his graduation he returned to his native city of Zhob, where his father advised him to engage in revitalizing his madrasa. He became the patron of Madrasa, Shams-ul-Uloom following his father's wishes.Ancestral backgroundShams-ud-din belonged to the Harifal tribe. Shams-ud-din's forefather had been religious scholars for many generations. His first cousin, Obaid-ullah Khan Harifal, was the sardar (tribal chieftain) of the Harifal tribe. His grandfather, Muhammad Rafique, was a saint and had many disciples, as did his father. Another grandfather, Abdul Haq Harifal, had resisted British occupation, in present-day Shinghar.Political careerShams-ud-din was a member of Tehreek-e-Khatme Nabuwwat, which demanded the government of Pakistan declare Ahmadis as non-Muslims.During the general election of 1970, Shams-ud-din participated and contested the election at PB 10, Fort Sandeman (as Zhob was then known), on the platform of his political party Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam. He came in first in the election with 7,578 votes, more than double the total of the second-place finisher, Nawabzada Taimur Shah Jogezai, of the Muslim League (Qayyam), who received 3,726 Votes.On 2 May 1972, chairman Abdul Samad Khan Achakzai opened the first session of the Provincial Assembly of Balochistan, in the town hall, Quetta. During this session, Nawab Muhammad Khan Barozai of the National Awami Party (NAP) was elected as Speaker of Assembly. The very next day, 3 May 1972, Shams-ud-din was unanimously elected Deputy Speaker.(Ataullah Mengal had already been elected on 1 May as chief Minister.)It was a coalition government of NAP and JUI. Shams-ud-din was the youngest member of the assembly at age 28. Unfortunately, the assembly only lasted for ten months, before the Federal Government of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto dismissed the Provincial Government of Balochistan on 13 February 1973.Arrest On 15 July 1973, Shams-ud-din held a rally in Zarif Sheed Park, Zhob. He delivered a speech against the dissemination of tampered Qurans and literature in his native city, allegedly by Ahmadis. Tampering news inflamed the emotions of the people, which lead to riots and lynchings.Between 17 and 18 July 1973, Shams-ud-din's Zhob residence was cordoned off by a heavy contingent of Frontier Corps, who arrested him. The next morning, news of his arrest spread through the city, and tribesmen from all around blocked the outgoing roads to prevent him from being taken away. As the public protest grew out of control, authorities took him away by helicopter. This only further inflamed unrest all over the country.Several days after Shams-ud-din's disappearance, Mufti Mehmood demanded on the floor of the National Assembly that his whereabouts be revealed, even if he were dead. On that demand the Interior Minister Abdul Qayyum Khan confessed that Shams-ud-din was alive and in custody at Ma-wand (Kohlu) District, Balochistan. His arrest was controversial throughout the province.During his detention period, his father Muhammad Zahid Harifal received a message from then Governor Akbar Bugti, through his special emissary Saleh Muhammad, seeking a meeting at Quetta, so that the release of Shams-ud-dincould be worked out. Muhammad Zahid declined to accede to this proposal.A writ petition of habeas corpus was filed in Sindh-Balochistan High Court, Karachi, challenging his illegal confinement and petitioning for his release, on the premise that the prisoner had been detained incommunicado. Shams-ud-din was released on 18 August 1973. He received a grand reception when he returned to Zhob.A couple of days after his release, he held a rally in Central Jama Mosque, Zhob, and expressed his determination to go ahead with his mission.Meanwhile, his two colleagues, Saleh Muhammad Mardanzai of Muslim Bagh and Hassan Shah, who were elected on the JUI ticket, switched over to the ruling Pakistan People's party. Their actions conjured up illusions of victory in the minds of many hawkish politicians, who believed that Shams-ud-din would also switch parties. He was even offered the position of provincial Chief Minister as a reward, but refused.DeathIn the first week of March 1974, Shams-ud-din left Zhob for Quetta, and along with Muhammad Zaman Khan Achakzai (Provincial General Secretary of the JUI) called on the governor of Balochistan, Khan of Kalat Mir Ahmed Yar Khan, and conveyed him the message of Darkhawasti, and reminded him his commitment for implementing Islamic laws. The governor replied positively, stating, 'we seek your cooperation'.After his meeting with the governor, Shams-ud-din left Quetta for Khanpur, where he met with his mentor Darkhawasti, who prediction to Shams-ud-din, 'it could be our last meeting'. A few days prior, an attempt had been made on Darkhawasti's life at his official residence in Quetta and Darkhawasti was concerned.On 10 March 1974,Shams-ud-din addressed his last gathering near the vegetable market in Rahimyarkhan, Punjab Pakistan. Later that same day he left for Sibi and stayed overnight.On 13 March 1974, Shams-ud-din was driving home to Zhob along with one of his friends. On the way to Zhob, Shams-ud-din stopped in Akhterzai for his noon prayers. After prayers were over, Shams-ud-din resumed the drive. Thirty-five kilometers from Akhterzai, near a village called 'Khulgai' (Killa Saifullah District), where his friend shot him thrice in the head from behind the driver's seat.Later that same day, Malik Gul Hassan, who also happened to be on way to Zhob, saw an abandoned car on the side of the road and went to investigate. He found the body of Maulana Shams-ud-din, and the whole interior of car stained with blood. He turned back to Killa Saifullah and informed police and district authorities. It was learnt later that Shams-ud-din's friend had visited him at Quetta and stayed with him for three days before insisting on accompanying him to Zhob.Aftermath The next day, people took to the streets in Quetta, chanting slogans against his assassination. At Bacha Khan crossroads, police clashed with demonstrators, opening fire on the crowd, killing six and injuring more than one hundred people; however, the unrest didn't subside. His funeral prayer became a massive demonstration of popular acclaim.The next day, 14 March 1974, he was laid to rest at Zhob graveyard. At 29 years old, Shams-ud-din was survived by his widow and a daughter, his parents, and his brothers.Legacy Shams-ud-din's death created such a wave of sympathy that it left political repercussions in the province. North Balochistan is the current political heartland of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam, who controlnot only large numbers of radical Madrassas, but a majority of the legislative seats at both the national and provincial level.A main crossroads in Zhob was renamed 'Maulana Shams-ud-din Shaheed Chowk' in 2012 by the people of Zhob.Numerous legends and popular songs have grown around his personality. People still believe that on his burial there was a shower of petals, and his blood continued to ooze from his body 24 hours after his body, with a fragrant smell.References1944 births 1974 deaths Deobandis Pakistani Sunni Muslim scholars of Islam Pashtun people People from Zhob District", "machine_text": "Shams-ud-din Harifal, also known as Shams al-Din Muhammad bin Hasan al-Harifal, was a renowned Muslim scholar and poet who lived in the 13th century.

The Tejano Music Awards were first awarded in 1981 and was established to recognize the most talented performers of Tejano music—a subgenre of regional Mexican music. The nominees were originally selected by a voting poll conducted among program directors and disc jockeys of Spanish-language radio stations in Texas. Originally, winners were chosen by Tejano radio station KIWW listeners, and later by fans of Tejano musicians in the Southwest of the United States. Winners are selected through a survey of 50,000 Texas households with Hispanic surnames. By 1987, the award ceremony was broadcast through 32 radio stations and 25 local television channels in Texas, New Mexico, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Louisiana. The awards ceremony were originally held at the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center, then to the San Antonio Convention Center until 1994, and the Alamodome until 1999. As of 2015, the ceremony is held annually at the Tobin Center for the Performing Arts in San Antonio, Texas.The award was first presented to Lisa Lopez for two consecutive years. Lopez was credited to have become the first female Tejano singer to have a number one single on the Regional Mexican Airplay chart in 1982. Tejano music's 'first leading lady', Laura Canales won the award for four consecutive times. The 'Queen of Tejano music' Selena, dominated the awards for nine consecutive years and dominated the Tejano Music Award for Female Vocalist of the Year for much of the 1990s decade. In 1997, Jennifer Peña won the award, the first time since 1988 that a new recipient won. Pena dominated the award until Elida Reyna won in 2000; she became the second participant to only win the award once, behind Patsy Torres' win in 1987. In 2002, Shelly Lares won for the first time since she was nominated in 1990.
